both of your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan so for your problem of bilateral knee pain based on what you told me your exam and reviewing your mri your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a very common condition that we see that causes knee pain especially in active young people so this condition has to do with the way your kneecap which is your patella how that moves along the groove of your thigh your thigh bone which is the femur now for the pain you may continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatory as needed to help with the pain but i'm also going to recommend physical therapy where where they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you may have so do you have any questions for me about that","40":"you got four to six weeks to

some cervical lymphadenopathy . and your lungs have bilateral ronchi in them , um , and some wheezing . so , what that means is , you know , you have a little infection . you probably have a little bit of a cold , and you have some lymph nodes that are swollen , and some congestion in your lungs , like you said . let's go ahead and take a look at some of your results . okay ?","48":"okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ?","49":"yeah that's a mouthful","50":"achiness okay did you do anything yesterday that you think might have caused the pain","51":"okay we'll start with skin testing and we'll see if we can target what the triggers in hopes in hopes that we can avoid any any other management and this can be successful if we ca n't figure out what it is from that we'll have to discuss more testing in your blood and do immunotherapy so i wan na see you next week to schedule the skin testing do you have any questions for me","52":"okay , so on physical examination , you know , your heart sounds great . there's ... it's a regular rate and rhythm . your lungs are nice and clear . on your back exam , you do

week with somebody .","57":"all right . so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension . they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up . when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure .","58":"okay and have you noticed are you urinating more than usual or

discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days .","90":"not because of it . okay .","91":"doctor: alright take care bye","92":"okay . and you had been taking the effexor for your depression .

this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have","104":"um , how about um , your

bit about you . okay ?","258":"doctor: all right . hey , dragon ? finalize the note .","259":"good alright so i'm gon na go ahead and tell you what we're gon na do so i'm gon na tell you my assessment and plan here so dad so for the first problem i do believe that karen does have a tick eye tics are very common in children and as many as you know one in five children have a tick during their school years and tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging facial grimacing sniffling excessive throat clearing and uncontrolled vocalization i can say that essentially they're brief sudden and involuntary motor movements now we do n't have a full understanding of the cause of the tics but they typically occur around five to ten years of age but most ticks go away on their own and they disappear within a year so these are what we call transient tics and the best thing to do is ignore the tics so it does n't seem to be bothering karen and she seems to be doing well in school and activities so it may wax and wane over time but you might notice it more towards the end of the day when the child is tired so you may also you know see it if they're stressed so that's why it's important to just ignore it now when you draw attention to the tick it does make the child conscious so that can make the tic worse so we want to be careful again just to to kind of not to draw too much attention on it and do you have any questions for me","260":"yeah well i'm also curious you know you have diabetes have you been checking your blood sugar","261":"yeah no problem we'll get those tests and my nurse will come in and we'll we'll we'll take it from there does that sound good","262":"okay . all right . all right . maybe that has to do with some of the salt intake you're , you're
