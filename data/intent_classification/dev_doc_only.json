pressure but but i think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure have you noticed any findings with that or have you know have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that because we do n't have it in our system here yet but i did add it in today but we do n't have you on any medications yet for that","63":"okay alright right elbow when i touch it does it hurt on the inside","64":"okay . and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ?","65":"okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .","66":"well do you have any other questions for me or is there anything else i can do for you","67":"on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee","68":"you're welcome . and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else . and then

let's go ahead and continue you on the omeprazole , 20 milligrams a day . do you have any questions , lawrence ?","70":"is it right around where you had surgery","71":"okay now you mentioned going for a walk my wife and i've been on on back behind the new rex center where the new trails are have you guys been back there","72":"you have , you know , decreased range of motion with flexion and extension , and , um , you have a positive straight leg raise . uh , for your strength , you do have a 4 out of 5 on your right and 5 out of 5 on your left . so , what does that mean ? what does all that mean ? so , that basically means that , you know , i , i think that you probably , you know , have injured your , your back with a muscle strain , but we're gon na look at some of your results , okay ?","73":"um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .","74":"okay , and does the , um , do those symptoms improve when you stand up or change position ?","75":"have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ?","76":"alright and are you able to bend backward","77":"yes . and so , if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for five days .","78":"yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .","79":"okay so let's start start with what happened did something cause the pain","80":"alright alright so when you are when i'm pressing here and like flexing your wrist are you experiencing any pain","81":"okay , and was that your mom or dad's father ?","82":"for your high blood pressure your blood pressure in the clinic looks pretty good it's about one twenty over seventy right now we have you on norvasc five milligrams once a day how are things going with that are you are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all","83":"okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective","84":"okay . is it one knee versus the other , or both ?","85":"so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision .","86":"okay okay good so let me go ahead and do a physical exam here real quick and you know i'm gon na quickly just listen to your heart and lungs okay that's good i'd like you to squeeze i'm gon na hold your hands here and i'd like you to squeeze both hands","87":"anything new since your last visit ?","88":"i do understand that some people have like reservations about going to the chiropractor but you know we do have some good ones that have like

therapy","89":"mm-hmm","90":"hey mason good to see you today so let's see you here in my notes for evaluation of kidney stones your your pcp said you had some kidney stones so you got a referral over

middle finger or the third finger . and i'm gon na put you on a little bit of pain medicine just to help , just , like , two days' worth . okay , so tramadol , 50 milligrams , every six hours as

the good thing about um , these kinds of fractures is generally , they will heal up without surgery . um , but we have to put you in a sling that weighs your arm down and pulls it down . so we're going to put you in a long arm cast and a sling , and then we're gon na check you in two weeks to see if those bones have realigned and if they have n't , then we're gon na have to talk about doing surgery at that time .","129":"okay , all right . okay , and- and can you describe it ?","130":"um , is that something that you wan na revisit , or do you wan na look into therapy , or do you think

. we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two
