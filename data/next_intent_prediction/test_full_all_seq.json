this is hurting and i ca n't work on it right now because it's hurting so much[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] i am so sorry so i mean that's really cool that you do parttery it's something that i've wanted to pick up you know but i do n't know that i have those skills yet does the pain radiate down your arm or up your shoulder or anything [Patient] yeah it does down my arm and along that inside of my arm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so the medial aspect okay have you did you hit it on anything [Patient] no not that i recall[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and have you ever injured your elbow before [Patient] no i have n't[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright so on a on a scale of one to ten with ten being your arm is actively being sought off by a chainsaw how bad is the pain [Patient] well i'd say it's about a seven[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] wow that's pretty bad does it keep you up at night [Patient] yes it really does it's you know if i roll over and it it it just wakes me up[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you done anything to relieve the pain [Patient] well i have been taking some ibuprofen but that is n't really helping[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and have you tried anything like ice or heat or anything else [Patient] i tried a little bit of ice at first[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] but and it's just it's been hurting for about four days now[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay okay so it's probably it do you think it's getting worse [Patient] well it's just not getting better[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay no i understand okay so i know that you also have like a history of hypertension and that we have you on ten milligrams of lisinopril have you been checking your blood pressures regularly [Patient] yeah you know what i remember too i mean they they have been pretty good one teens to one thirties[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright and okay do you think that you've been good about taking your medications do you usually take them everyday [Patient] yeah pretty much i i i you know set an alarm for that lisinopril[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] awesome that's great alright and so i see that you also we are treating you for diabetes as well and that we have you on five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day how about that have you been taking that regularly [Patient] well sometimes i forget i mean having a medication twice a day you know sometimes i'm out doing stuff and i just forget to take it[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright so when you say a sweet tooth what are we talking about there [Patient] i love to bak also besides my ceramics i'm really big and baking and i like to make cakes and and take them to you know parties and get togethers you know family get togethers and i like to make senna rules too i've been doing that since i was very young so i kinda noticed that[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay cinnamon rolls can be kind of hard like do you for your cakes do you do you use fondant you know to like do any of the decorations [Patient] no i i mine are just pretty basic they're not overly fancy[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] so you know it's good [Patient] yeah[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] alright well so i totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family but we maybe wan na start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves is do you think that's something we could manage [Patient] yeah i know i need to get better on it i probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what i should and should n't eat how like if i need to combine a protein you know if i do eat something a little bit sweet maybe pling a protein or something with it[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a [Patient] had some friends tell me something about that[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah that sounds like a great idea and i think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice you know i do n't wan na as much as it's really helpful to have friends i do wan na be able to give you like a source of truth right [Patient] yeah i i had a diabetic consult a long time ago but yeah it it would be nice to see a dietitian again and go over those and maybe there is some new stuff too[SEP][Discussion][Physical Examination][Other Treatments][Doctor] a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay [Patient] yeah and can i ask you what word what were my vital signs can you show me what my vital signs were[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far [Patient] no that sounds good yeah i was just curious[SEP][Physical Examination][Other Socials][Doctor] mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on [Patient] well i do go for some walks in the evening i try to get one in on the morning too[SEP][Physical Examination][Other Socials][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] so not a whole lot other than that because i'm busy with my pottery or baking so but i do try to get out and walk daily[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay that's awesome so like how about about how long are your walks [Patient] well i just walk around the neighborhood there is you know the sidewalks and there is kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge and so it's probably you know maybe one to two miles a day[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] wow that's intense i was not expecting that number that's awesome okay alright so maybe this five pounds is muscle we're gon na go for it okay but thank you but that's some really important information but i'm gon na start your physical exam now okay [Patient] okay[SEP]","1":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] patient is julia jones , date of birth

fine how about your water consumption [Patient] yes but i've been drinking a lot more water and i do realize that i i wake up sometimes during the night to you know use the restroom to pee more than i

school is actually going well gotten good grades[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] they usually do anybody who chooses to engage in physics for the rest of their life i question their choices it's fine okay but are you when you're like while you are at school like has anybody been sick i know like with you know covid has been going around but like have you noticed anybody like that sick all the time around you [Patient] sick all the time everybody is sick these days[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] alright [Patient] so[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] but what about at home how about your siblings are any of them sick [Patient] most of them are healthy yeah most of them are healthy although you know i have a brother who smokes i have told him not to smoke he does n't listen[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] house told not to smoke at the house but you know anyway[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct [Patient] yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay [Patient] sure[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain [Patient] no[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerular nephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment [Patient] how much are all these tests going to cost[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them [Patient] okay that's that's good to know[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today [Patient] okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] and right after that i have to go to work[SEP]","3":"[Conversation Start][Acute

[Patient] okay . so there are times when i'm either doing very , very mild exercises or just walking , even if i'm just walking up , you know , my driveway , i find myself palpitating a lot , and there's a little bit of shortness of breath .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] i do n't know if it's got to do with the back pain , you know , whether that gets triggered as well at the same time .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] right .

[Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP]","11":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] well good morning emily how are you [Patient] good morning[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] how are you doing [Patient] doing okay i'm

the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines and your door frames have been looking crooked to you is that right [Patient] it is yes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay what kind of venture are we gon na go into do you do you have the the script or no it it just talks [Patient] but it's it's not presenting like like how you're reading it like how you're talking about it is it kinda what i'm saying because like after that i'm supposed to say yeah whenever i take my husband out to like a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights but i'm not really getting the question of like so what's causing it or where do you have this happening stuff like that so i'm a little confused[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay i mean i can just straight out follow the script just so we can kinda get it rolling so so i said so hi so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines in your door frames have been looking crooked to you [Patient] yeah and whenever i take my husband out to a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] uh okay so do you have a favorite restaurant you like to go to [Patient] i do mcdonalds is one of my favorite here in arlington[SEP]","12":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on [Patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta [Patient] yes and and fish oil[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that [Patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy[SEP][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so [Patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging [Patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then[SEP][Referral][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time [Patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack[SEP][Referral][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies [Patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking [Patient] i thought it was close to sixty[SEP][Other Treatments][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet [Patient] yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results[SEP][Personal History][Lab Examination][Doctor] i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist [Patient] oh[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] that's your kidney doctor [Patient] i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil [Patient] right yeah that's i threw all of those out[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span [Patient] i'm a more of a san francisco fan[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again [Patient] okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] you can take tylenol [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur on your heart which i've heard before in the past and it does n't it does n't look like you're retaining any fluid which is good but you do have a little puffiness in your legs which sometimes some of the medications can cause [Patient] yeah i do have that[SEP][Referral][Medication][Reassessment][Doctor] so let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and and plan for you going forward so for your first problem of your coronary artery disease i think you're doing really well i wan na go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in in exercising again okay and i am gon na go ahead and refill your metoprolol your crestor forty milligrams once a day as well as the aspirin okay i do n't think we need to proceed with a a stress test or anything at this time but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay for your [Patient] sounds really good[SEP][Referral][Reassessment][Doctor] good for your second problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i am gon na reach out to doctor miller and make an appointment for you to be seen just because again i think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Referral][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] and then for your third problem of your diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c and i'm gon na put that referral in for the dietitian to give you some dietary education and i'm gon na go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your your insulin regimen okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] any questions [Patient] yeah you know i've been kinda down ever since i had my heart attack is there any medication that i could take to make me feel a little bit less sad[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] yeah i mean are you having any thoughts of of harming yourself or harming others [Patient] no no i just feel kinda down[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you feel kinda down what's your [Patient] life sucks[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] what well i do n't think so what what's your support system like [Patient] you know i i live with my dog and that's it so it's kind of you know lonely[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Doctor] okay alright well would you be interested in in like a referral to psychiatry or something like that so that you have someone to talk to about some of of issues because medication can help but i do i think it's important to have you know talk some of these things out [Patient] okay yeah you know i'll give that a try i mean i'm retiring i got plenty of time[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Reassessment][Doctor] okay so why do n't we go ahead and i'm gon na place a referral to psychiatry for you know you know difficulty adjusting after having a heart attack maybe some some mild depression okay does that sound okay okay [Patient] yeah that sounds really good thank you[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay you're welcome anything else [Patient] so you will do the medication refill do i so that's automatic[SEP]","13":"[Conversation

hey anna good to see you today so i'm looking here in my notes says you have you're coming in today for some right ankle pain after a fall so can you tell me what happened how did you fall [Patient] yeah so i was taking out the trash last night and i ended up slipping on a patch of ice like and then when i fell i heard this pop and it just hurts[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so have you been able to walk on it at all or is it you know [Patient] at first no like my friend who was visiting thankfully had to help me get into the house and i you know and now i'm able to put like a little bit of weight on it but i'm i i'm still limping[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay well you know that's not good we'll we'll hopefully we can get you fixed up here so how much how much pain have you been in on a scale of one to ten with ten being the worst pain you ever felt [Patient] it's it's more like so when i first fell it was pretty bad but now it's it's at like a six you know like it's uncomfortable[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and how would you describe that pain is it a constant pain or is it only when you move the ankle [Patient] it's it's constant it's like a throbbing pain you know and like when i touch it it feels kinda warm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright yeah but yeah i can feel it here so it does feel a little bit warm so i said you've been in a little bit of pain so have you taken anything for it [Patient] well like last night i iced it and i kept it elevated you know i also took some ibuprofen last night and this morning[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] alright has the ibuprofen helped at all [Patient] not really[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright so i just want to know i know some of my patients they have like bad ankles where they hurt the ankles all the time but have you ever injured this ankle before [Patient] so you know in high school i used to play a lot of soccer but and and like i had other injuries but i've never injured like this particular ankle before but because i used to play like all the time i knew what i was supposed to do but this is i also knew that it was it was time to come in[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay yeah yeah definitely if you if you ca n't walk on it we definitely good thing that you came in today and we were able to see you so have you experienced any numbness in your foot at all [Patient] no no numbness and i do n't think i've had like any tingling or anything like that[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay that that's good yeah it sounds like you have sensation there so yeah that that's really good so let me do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals your blood pressure was one twenty over eighty which is good your heart rate your spo2 was ninety eight percent which is good that means you're you're getting all of your oxygen and so let me go ahead and look at your ankle real quick so when i press here does that hurt [Patient] yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright what about here [Patient] yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so looking at your ankle and your right ankle exam on the skin there is ecchymosis so you have that bruising which you can see of the lateral [Patient] malleolus[SEP][Physical Examination][Personal History][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] malleolus associated with swelling there is tenderness to palpation of the anterior laterally in the soft tissue there is no laxity on the anterior drawer and inversion stress there is no bony tenderness on palpation of the foot on your neurovascular exam of your right foot there your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch alright so we did get an x-ray of your ankle before you came in and luckily it's there is no fractures no bony abnormalities which is really good so let me talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for your right ankle pain your symptoms your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain have you sprained your ankle before most times people do the athletics play soccer it happens every so often but have you done that before [Patient] no i do n't think so[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay well you're one of the lucky ones some of my my patients that play sports they sprain their ankle seems like every other week so good for you so for that that that ankle sprain i just want to keep i want you to keep your leg elevated when you're seated and i want you to continue to ice it you can ice it let's say five times a day for twenty minutes at a time just to help that swelling go down i'm gon na give you an air cast to help you stabilize the ankle so keep it from moving and then i'll give you crutches and so i want you to stay off that leg for about one to two days and then you can start walking on it as tolerated tolerated so how does that sound [Patient] it's alright[SEP]","16":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] good morning noah tell me a little bit about why you are here today [Patient] hi

[Patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [Patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .[SEP][Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [Patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [Patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , good . [Patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ? [Patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ... [Patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [Patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you . [Patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated . [Patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [Patient] okay , thank you . got it .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ? [Patient] no , not that i know of .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . [Patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ? [Patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay . we might give you some of that . [Patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ? [Patient] yes , i also do have that problem .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that . [Patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , sounds good . [Patient] great .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [Patient] okay , i will do that .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future . [Patient] okay , that's okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not . [Patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range . [Patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [Patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .[SEP][Personal History][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [Patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , this is much better . [Patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [Patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [Patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [Patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started . [Patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?[SEP]","18":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey alan i good to see you today so i looked here my appointment notes and i see that you're coming in you had some shoulder pain left shoulder pain for the last three weeks so how you doing is it is it gotten any better [Patient] yeah yeah i've been having a lot of pain of my shoulder for the last three weeks now and it's not getting better[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay do you remember what you were doing when the pain first started [Patient] so i i was thinking that i i ca n't recall like falling on it injuring it getting hit[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so do you remember hitting it or anything like that [Patient] no nothing at all[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright did you fall do you remember doing that [Patient] no[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay hmmm so like a little mystery so have you had pain in that shoulder before [Patient] i mean i'm very active so i can get pains in my shoulders but it's nothing that sometime some tylenol can help[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and are you able to move the arm or is it kinda just stuck [Patient] i'm having a lot of pain like i can move it but you know when i try to reach for something lifting anything and even like i do n't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder [Patient] it actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder it does n't go down anywhere[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go [Patient] it's pretty much all the time anytime i put any pressure on it like when i'm trying to sleep it hurts even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so i know you mentioned tylenol [Patient] so this time i have n't taken anything for it[SEP]","19":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] hey mason good to see you today so let's see you here in my notes for evaluation of kidney stones your your pcp said you had some kidney stones so you got a referral over so can you tell me a little bit about that you know what happened when did you first notice them [Patient] yeah it was about you know about a week ago and i was working down in the the barn with the horses and you know i was moving some hay but i developed this real sudden onset of pain in my right back and i thought it initially it was from throwing hay but it i broke out into a sweat i got real nauseated and that's when i went and saw my doctor and he ordered a cat scan and said that i had a kidney stone but you know that's i i've never had that before my father's had them in the past but yeah so that's that's how that all happened[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so you said you had the pain on the right hand side does it move anywhere or radiate [Patient] well when i had it it would it radiated almost down to my groin[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go [Patient] well when i you know after i found out i had a disk a kidney stone it came a couple times but it did n't last as long no i've been i've been straining my urine they told me to pee in this little cup[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] and i've been straining my urine and you know i do n't see anything in there[SEP]","20":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi bruce , how are you ?

what's been going on [Patient] so i've been having this pain for the past one week and as you know i have a longstanding history of diabetes and i guess i've been drinking too much coffee lately i do n't know if that triggered my gastritis so[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright and so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what [Patient] it's gradually

it's so strong so that's my achilles heel i tell you but okay so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain uh you you you you've been drinking more coffee and maybe that's related as you're thinking [Patient] yeah i think so because i started last week and towards the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad so i've been controlling myself this week and you know i i probably just had one cup[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay yeah okay and so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it [Patient] it's on both the sides of my

alleviate the pain [Patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in

[Patient] i'm doing okay , thank you .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed . [Patient] yeah , that would not be good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery . [Patient] yeah , that's right .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive . [Patient] yeah , i noticed that too . i think the oxyglutinine is helping as well . my urgency to use the bathroom is much better .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well that's great . [Patient] yeah , i , i'm pleased about it too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ? [Patient] yeah , i had leg cramps the other day , but i thought it might , was maybe just because i was cold as i had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep . i had cramps when i woke up in both legs right here . um i drank pickle juice and it went right away .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well do n't , do n't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it . [Patient] haha , i know , i only drink about 4 ounces or so .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay good . [Patient] um it went away so i did n't drink anymore . i find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] sure just , just keep it in moderation . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Vegetative History][Doctor] and then are you still on an iron supplement ? and are you using the bathroom okay ? [Patient] uh yes , everything is good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ? [Patient] no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] great . [Patient] um and after i stopped taking that um i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ? [Patient] uh yeah , that's right .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great . [Patient] good , that's a relief to hear .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though . [Patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march . [Patient] all righty .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today . [Patient] all righty that sounds good .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good . [Patient] okay great . that all sounds awesome .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right let's take a quick listen . use my general physical exam template . and take a couple of deep breaths for me . your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things .

appointments were backed up and i tried some pt at my gym but it it really did n't seem to help and i was really concerned[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and what exactly are your symptoms are you having pain when you're just sitting there or when you're moving around for a very short period of time [Patient] it felt like i was gon na tapple over i like i could n't support my my upper body weight and then my right toe or the the toes on my right foot tingled a little bit but that went away after about an hour[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay are you still getting that numbing and tingling periodically in your feet or is that completely gone [Patient] that's completely gone it it just happened when i first felt the the tweak in my lower back i felt that sensation but i have n't since[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and how about any difficulty or weakness in your legs [Patient] only if i'm carrying something heavy otherwise it seems relatively normal but i i feel the sensation so i'm a little nervous about carrying something heavy[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and are and do you still have pain down there in your lower back [Patient] if i turn a certain way or if i roll over in my sleep i'll wake up from it from a like a sharp pain but then that that goes away if i if i position myself the right way[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and what have you been taking for the pain [Patient] i took some tylenol i took some ibuprofen i've tried heat i've tried ice and nothing really seems to help[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay is the ibuprofen any better than the tylenol [Patient] a little bit but for sure a shorter period of time[SEP][Therapeutic History][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and did you get any stomach upset from the ibuprofen [Patient] no i try not to take too much so i i do n't have an upset stomach from it[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and did you go to like an urgent care centing or an emergency room have you had any imaging on this at all [Patient] i went to an urgent care and they wanted me to do an mri but i was a little concerned because i think we maxed out our insurance so i i did n't do it because it started to feel better but because it's been going on so long i'm i'm a little bit concerned now i i do wan na actually move forward with that[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright and any other symptoms any problems with like your bladder or your bowels any incontinence or you know you feel like you ca n't go to the bathroom [Patient] no i have n't had any of those issues[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright and any other any other past medical history do you that you have any [Patient] i had knee surgery about two years ago on my right knee[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and what did you have done to your right knee [Patient] it was a total knee replacement[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay a total knee replacement in twenty eighteen is that what you said [Patient] no it was actually about two years ago so it's the spring of twenty twenty[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright alright well i wan na go ahead and just move on to a physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] now you have you had any fever or chills with this [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright alright so looking at your vital signs here in the office you know they look really good your you you do n't have any temperature your blood pressure is good it's about one seventeen over fifty six [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty eight and your oxygenation is fine at ninety five percent on room air so that means everything looks good [Patient] good[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] on your neck exam i i do appreciate some bony protuberance of the c5 c6 do you have any pain when i touch here [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] no okay on your lumbar spine exam i do appreciate do you have pain when i touch here [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay so there is no pain to palpation of the lumbar spine there is decreased flexion and extension of the lower back the patient does have a positive straight leg raise and there is some spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine on musculoskeletal exam the lower extremities strength is equal bilaterally so what does that mean jeremy that means that you have some you know maybe a some arthritis in your neck here and or maybe just a a little bit of some injury from from that from that back that back thing that you told me about [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] okay but i think overall things look really good so you know i had them do an lumbar spine x-ray on you before i saw you and i looked at the results of your lumbar spine x-ray which showed no acute bony abnormality you know there was no fracture of your back or anything which is not surprising based on your history so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so i do believe it sounds like you have an acute disk herniation now this did happen a few months ago but it sounds like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having symptoms [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Referral][Doctor] i do wan na go ahead and order a a lumbar spine mri to get a a a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they do n't show us any of the soft tissue so let's go ahead and order the lumbar spine mri i wan na continue with physical therapy so i'm going to refer you to a a physical therapist through our health system [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Medication][Doctor] and then i also wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] to help with that do you have any questions about that [Patient] no questions[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] now if you do have a herniated disk we can go ahead and talk about some other treatment options maybe like an epidural steroid injection to help take down some of that inflammation [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it might make you feel better but we'll we'll deal with that when we get get there okay [Patient] sure[SEP]","56":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey good morning bobby how are you [Patient]

and go more of a keto diet[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah and that can happen and one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods which is you know kind of the the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food and has that been difficult since you are watching your carb intake [Patient] the fatty food it is a little bit difficult you know i like those pork grinds and you know i i've had to kind of cut those out they were a nice staple for me when i was on the keto diet but i have cut out

[Patient] yeah . they said they did n't really see anything on the scan .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] yes , i agree . it looked normal . [Patient] the problem is i'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] is the pain there all the time ? [Patient] it's a nagging feeling and it just depends . sometimes it bothers me , sometimes it does n't .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] has this been the case over the past two years as well ?

[Patient] about three to four times a week . it's like when i need to go to the bathroom , if i can massage it , it feels like it's moving some and i can eventually go .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and when you have a bowel movement , does the pain change ? [Patient] yeah , it gets a little better .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] and are you eating and drinking okay ? any nausea or vomiting , heartburn or indigestion ?

[Patient] it's usually just one time and then it's over .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] and how's your weight been ? any fluctuation ? [Patient] nice and pretty stable , although i could stand to lose about 25 pounds .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ? [Patient] not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even thought i've never been diagnosed with it .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi cancer or liver disease ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ? [Patient] i've never had any surgery .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all those are still intact ? [Patient] yup .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ? [Patient] no . i thought that happen when you turn 50 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well , that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy , like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants . [Patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain . [Patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ? [Patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ? [Patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ? [Patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ? [Patient] i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ? [Patient] hardly ever . maybe once a month .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] and do you consume alcohol ? [Patient] uh , yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay . and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ?

[Patient] no .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice . [Patient] what would cause that ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted . [Patient] that's good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly . [Patient] what's that ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon . [Patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged . [Patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] correct . [Patient] so what does that mean ?[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","65":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] hey gregory good to see you today so take a look at my notes and i see that you're here you've had a nonhealing foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it [Patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [Patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [Patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [Patient] i do n't recall the name exactly[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] do n't recall alright [Patient] something i had taken it before[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [Patient] i'm sorry[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [Patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [Patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red[SEP][Personal History][Reassessment][Doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [Patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay do you [Patient] i'm not really sure how[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [Patient] i think they told me it was around ten[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [Patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [Patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [Patient] that sounds great[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] alright do you have any other question [Patient] i do if anything happens in between[SEP]","66":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hello , mrs . martinez . good to see you today .

in twenty eighteen we put a stent into your right coronary artery you're still taking your medications for that you're still on your aspirin [Patient] i am yes yeah i do the baby aspirin every day[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright and any chest pain or shortness of breath or anything like that no no yeah no nothing more than yeah i would n't attribute anything [Patient] okay and do you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here [Patient] no[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Referral][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help [Patient] any questions[SEP]","74":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] all right

with hepatitis c so based on the the once i just discussed with you there now hepatitis c is a viral infection that affects the liver so you most likely may have had it for years now so the next step

i missed a step and i just totally[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere [Patient] no not really[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay any numbness any tingling [Patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well [Patient] yeah it does[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like [Patient] not without extreme pain[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up [Patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt [Patient] yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright and then lateral as well [Patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist [Patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you [Patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down [Patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better[SEP][Physical Examination][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to [Patient] i'm sorry[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] pardon what [Patient] a what[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace [Patient] okay thank you[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay [Patient] when do i have to have the surgery[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] alright so what [Patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks [Patient] six weeks[SEP]","97":"[Conversation Start][Acute

[Patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . [Patient] okay . i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? [Patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ? [Patient] twice a day .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ? [Patient] no , that's fine .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] how often are you using that one ? [Patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ? [Patient] i'm not .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ? [Patient] no wipes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ? [Patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ? [Patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk . [Patient] it is ? okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself . [Patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that . [Patient] yes , i did . thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it . [Patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] let's see . [Patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much . [Patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 . [Patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form . [Patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , mm-hmm . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else . [Patient] can you do the metro market ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find . [Patient] sure .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say . [Patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] correct , it's not a steroid . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad . [Patient] okay . got it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ? [Patient] okay , thank you for explaining .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so i will say , \" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . \" [Patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash. [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ? [Patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you . [Patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day . [Patient] that sounds good .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping . [Patient] okay , sounds good .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here . [Patient] thank you so much .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly . [Patient] sounds good .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream . [Patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ? [Patient] yeah , sounds good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] do you have enough refills ? [Patient] yeah , i think so .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one . [Patient] yes , i do .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well . [Patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks . [Patient] okay , thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples . [Patient] okay , that sounds good .[SEP]","100":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] alright scott so so i understand that you you had some right knee injury can you tell me a little bit about what happened [Patient] yeah i was trying to go out and play some pickup soccer games over the weekend and went to go plank kick the ball and and just felt a pop in my right knee[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and and how long ago did that happen [Patient] about three days ago[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] three days okay and when did you notice any swelling anything like that [Patient] it it's swollen some some of that swelling has gone down[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to ten one being the least pain ten being the worst pain how's how's it been ranging [Patient] it's somewhere between six and seven right now it's about four or five with some of the swelling going down[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright and did you take anything at all to relieve the pain [Patient] anti-inflammatories[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alrighty and did that help [Patient] yeah the ibuprofen helped a little bit but i'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] gotcha okay now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then [Patient] i can bend it but it hurts towards the end of the motion and i can straighten it but it does n't it feels like i have to help get it straightened[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright and then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all [Patient] i can still bear weight on it but it feels just really loose it it does n't feel normal[SEP]","101":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey william so i see that you injured your knee could you tell me a bit about what happened [Patient] yeah i thought it was a good idea to go to the trampoline park with my wife and heard a snap and instant pain when i was on the trampoline[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay alright and so do do you go to the trampoline park often [Patient] i do n't and i think that's the issue[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay so this is the first time you'd ever done something like that [Patient] yes[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay alright i just wan na get like a few more details do you like work out regularly was this for fun or for like an exercise class [Patient] no it's just for fun[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay and do you have like a regular exercise regimen at all [Patient] try to not consistent with it[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay no that's fine this is not a place of judgment i just i'm just trying to understand like if a little bit more of the background okay so we went to the trampoline park which knee where did you hurt [Patient] my right[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay your right knee and so based on like your inside and outside which part hurts more [Patient] it's kind of the outside of the knee[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright so the lateral aspect not a problem and you said that you heard a pop when you landed right [Patient] yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain [Patient] just tylenol[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] alright so did the tylenol help [Patient] not really[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright and so hmmm when does it have you tried anything else like did you ice it use heat anything like that [Patient] no i just kinda elevated it and that was about it[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay that's fine and how long ago did this happen [Patient] a week ago[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay alright so you put up with the pain for a week that's i'm proud of you for that [Patient] i do n't like to come to the doctors[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] excuse me i feel rejected right now why why would you say something like that it's fine but you know i i like it when you're not here either because that means that you're doing a good job so let's see about like getting your knee fixed up but i want to talk about some of the other issues that you have first so we know that you have hypertension right and i discussed maybe you getting a blood pressure cuff because i needed you to measure those a bit more regularly did you get the cuff [Patient] what no[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] no okay that's fine have you measured your blood pressure recently at all [Patient] no[SEP]","102":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , hannah . how are you ?

[Patient] yes . so , i've been eating a ton of sweets recently . with the holidays it just feels like there is always something sweet available. whether i am at work and there are holiday gift baskets or clients bringing in treats or when i visit my family for the holidays and there is every baked good imaginable, there is always something sweet i can be eating. in the beginning i felt fine, but i have started to feel it after a couple of weeks, and this past week i just felt really light-headed and i could ... was seeing spots , really dizzy . so i went into the emergency room and they said i had a high blood sugar . um , so i wanted to come in and follow up with you to get that , um , get checked out .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . all right . and how , how are you feeling now ? did they , did , did they treat you in the emergency room ? did they gi- they give you some iv fluids and things like that ? [Patient] yeah . they gave me some fluids and they told me just to try to really cut out eating any extra sweets and get back into my normal routine and diet, but i am still staying with my family, and my mom and grandmother are big bakers so i think it will be really hard to get into a routine there so i just want to make sure i am nipping this high blood sugar thing in the bud.[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and i saw you went through a review of systems sheet with a nurse . i just want to ask you a few more questions from that standpoint . so you have had any fever or chills ?

[Patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ? [Patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's the 250\/50 dose , correct ? [Patient] yes , correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ? [Patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ? [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ? [Patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ? [Patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no kidding , that's great . [Patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] really ? [Patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ? [Patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ? [Patient] probably about three or four .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ? [Patient] yes , that's correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ? [Patient] i do .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then . [Patient] nope .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ? [Patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ? [Patient] correct .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ? [Patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ? [Patient] yeah , that's right .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ? [Patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ? [Patient] yeah , it does , it works great .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ? [Patient] yep , that's correct .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ? [Patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it . [Patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ? [Patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","106":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] good morning sharon how you doing [Patient] hi i'm i'm okay today i'm having some shoulder pain[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] i see

[Patient] i'm good , how about you ?[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] well , how can i help you today ? [Patient] so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ? [Patient] um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ? [Patient] yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , i see that . [Patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] what do you do for a living ? [Patient] uh , i'm an x-ray tech .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ? [Patient] uh , i do take a blood pressure pill , and that's it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ? [Patient] uh , that's correct .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger . his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable now here ? [Patient] yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , how about here ? [Patient] um , there , it's not .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , not as bad ? [Patient] yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can . [Patient] my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ? [Patient] ow , .[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that . [Patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you . [Patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine . [Patient] so the good one is good ?[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley . [Patient] okay , all right .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone . [Patient] i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy .[SEP]","113":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey alan i good to see you today so i

[Patient Guest] all right . thank you .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine . you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well . [Patient Guest] okay . okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough . [Patient Guest] mm-hmm , got it .[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough . [Patient Guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine . [Patient Guest] okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .[SEP]","117":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03\/04\/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ? [Patient] good morning .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller . [Patient] it's nice to meet you as well .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ? [Patient] that's correct .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ? [Patient] well , right now the hand is .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , that's good . [Patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , i see . [Patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm , okay . [Patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though . [Patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ? [Patient] uh , no .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ? [Patient] um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ? [Patient] well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ? [Patient] uh , yes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . like , in terms of gripping things ? [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] really ? [Patient] yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ? [Patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ? [Patient] uh , yep .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ? [Patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ? [Patient] yeah , just a little strain .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ? [Patient] uh , yes .[SEP][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off . [Patient] i see .[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ? [Patient] i think that sounds good to me .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list . [Patient] uh , no , i do n't .[SEP][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ? [Patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ? [Patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again . [Patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .[SEP]","118":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hi michelle what's been going on the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee [Patient] yeah i'm gon na have to keep this my favorite story is that i had a sandra who injured her knee cold dancing so that would immediately came up to mine but let's try skiing so i was skiing in vermont last weekend and i caught my ski when i was coming off the lift and i fell and my knee popped and it's hurt ever since[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and were you able to ski down the hill or did you have to be taken down by the ski patrol [Patient] i had to be taken down by the ski patrol i was unable to bear weight[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay is n't that slightly terrifying they had to do the same thing for me and you're just kind of sitting there watching all of the trees go by so anyway so what part of your knee is bothering you the most is it the inside the outside [Patient] it hurts on the outside but it also feels like it wo n't hold my weight[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so it feels like it's gon na buckle [Patient] hmmm yes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright and are you able to bend it [Patient] i was immediately after the injury but not really now[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and how about straightening it are you able to straighten it at all [Patient] somewhat but it really hurts when i try to straighten all the way[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright now do you have any numbing or tingling in your toes [Patient] no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and can you feel your toes okay [Patient] i think so[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay alright now are you a pretty active person you said you were skiing do you do what kind of other activities do you do [Patient] i chase my two four -year-old[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay do you have twins [Patient] i do[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] nice that's great [Patient] yeah[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] so okay and what's your support like at home who is who is able to help out are you still doing that kind of hobbling around on crutches or [Patient] yeah now my husband is home with me but he also works a job where he is gone quite a bit so it's just me and the kids[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright and did the ski patrol give you crutches i i see you have them here with you okay alright great and are you otherwise generally healthy [Patient] yes[SEP]","119":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , alexander . how are you ?

[Patient] hi , dr. martinez . this weekend was a bit rough . i've had this numbness and tingling for a few weeks now .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so it's in both of your hands ? [Patient] yes , ever since my car wreck last december when i broke them ... well , once they healed , i mean , i noticed it more , the tingling and the numbness .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] and you still wear the splint only on the right wrist ? [Patient] no , i also wear the left sometimes . the right is just worse , but the splint helps . both have really gotten worse over the last month . when i broke them , my right wrist was definitely in worse shape . i've also been having some s- mild stiffness in my neck too . i hit my head during the accident , and they told me it was a contusion .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and where would you say the tingling and numbness is ? [Patient] on this side , it goes from here and here up to about here . on the other side , it's from here to here .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] i see . so on the right side , you're pointing from the middle and ring finger , all the way up the forearm . and on the left , the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger . and is there any pain or just tingling and numbness ?

[Patient] nope .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] all right , thank you , mr. cook . okay , first , we'll go over your review of systems . correct me if i'm wrong in any of this . constitutional , you have fatigue and weight gain ; gi , you have excessive appetite and bloating ; eyes have floaters ; cardiovascular shows shortness of breath and leg swelling ; endocrine , you're always hungry ; skin , you have some nail bed changes , dryness , itching ; musculoskeletal , you have gout and muscle pain . and the remainder of the review of systems is negative . [Patient] yep , that's all correct .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , we're going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination . let's look at the right hand first . can you feel this ? [Patient] yeah , but a little less on these two fingers .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Physical Examination][Doctor] sensation is normal , except pin prick sensation diminished in third and fourth fingers on the right . and how about on the left ? [Patient] um , yeah , but these two a little less .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Physical Examination][Doctor] sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left okay , let's test your reflexes now . reflexes are 1+ and symmetric ; 2+ knees ; toes are downgoing bilaterally . all right , i'm going to tap on your right wrist . do you feel anything ?

[Patient] yeah , for the most part .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . remember , it's also the portion sizes . so i mean , if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay . you have to just really watch the portions . [Patient] okay , good . i ca n't go out- go without some fried chicken at least once in a while .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] sounds good . all right , well let's take a look at you today , and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions , and we will discuss once we have finished the exam . [Patient] sounds good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . all right . i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . all right , so if you could just lay back for me , and i'll examine your abdomen . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . do you have any tenderness ? [Patient] no , not really .[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Medication][Doctor] okay . so the abdomen is soft , non-tender . no masses or organomegaly . and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . all right . you can go ahead and sit up now . thank you . all right , so first i want you to try citrucel . it does come in a tablet . you should use it twice daily for regularity . then i would say , if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 milligrams . you can do one tablet before you eat , and then repeat up to four times daily . and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything . um , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later , and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine . [Patient] okay , that sounds good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . and so your bentyl , that's the anti-spasm medication , and i would take the higher dose . [Patient] can i get a refill of that ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse . [Patient] yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] okay , and you can take it , but before you do , we want to try to reduce the triggers . uh , so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP]","127":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi alan , how are you ?

how are your symptoms [Patient] my symptoms are pretty good today i just kind of have a minimal cough and a sore throat[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and how about fatigue have you been feeling more tired [Patient] yes a little bit[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and how about any nausea or vomiting [Patient] no not as of today[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and i know you were mentioning a cough before how is it as far as walking are you having any shortness of breath [Patient] i have n't noticed any shortness of breath it just kind of seems to be a lingering kind of light dry cough[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] cough okay is it any mucus with it or is it a dry cough [Patient] more dry[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] a dry cough okay and tell me more about this sore throat [Patient] this kind of seems to be persistent comes and goes it will be worse sometimes and then others it feels better trying to drink lots of fluids[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and when you mention drinking and eating is do you feel like anything is getting stuck there [Patient] no i do n't feel like anything is getting stuck right now and i have n't been i have been eating but not as much as i normally would[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay okay alright and how are you doing as far as like just emotionally and mentally how are you doing i'm just talking a little bit about your support systems [Patient] the nursing staff and the office has been very good to help you know with anything that i need as far as support so just since we are just getting started so far on the journey i do feel like i have support and mentally you know still feel strong[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay and how about with family or friends have you been able to turn to anyone [Patient] i do have good family members that have been supportive and they have come to my treatment with me[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay excellent excellent and so right now you're on a combination of two different chemotherapies the cisplestan as well as the eupside and you had your last treatment just a few days ago but you're saying right now you've been able to tolerate the nausea and the fatigue [Patient] yes i have n't had any nausea but you know just slight fatigue it does n't seem to be overwhelming[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Radiology Examination][Reassessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far [Patient] that sounds great thank you[SEP][Medication][Other Treatments][Reassessment][Doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss [Patient] great[SEP]","130":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor]

History][Doctor] okay alright have you had any shortness of breath [Patient] no[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] no okay just the chest pain alright [Patient] yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so i'm gon na listen to your heart here and it it does seem like i do hear a slight murmur with your heart here and i i do n't think we've we've heard that before so i think i'm gon na get an ekg as well because i'm concerned you might be having like a mild heart attack so because you have the pain all the way up your elbow that go into your neck and your your chest pain as well i do n't think it's it's it's musculoskeletal pain because you said you had n't done anything with it so far so what i wan na do is and let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan here so i i do think that you or you do have that chest pain i'm concerned that you know you might be having a mild heart attack i'm gon na get ekg for that we're also gon na get you some aspirin is a nitroglycerin just to see if that helps with that pain as far as your for your diabetes i want you we're gon na get that p oct glucose and we'll keep you on be five hundred of metformin for now and then for your hypertension we'll keep you on that two . five of of norvasc but i think our most immediate issue is the is the chest pain and so we'll do the ekg and depending upon those results we'll we'll call nine one one because we really need to get you to the hospital if that is the case so how does that sound [Patient] i do n't know i was talking to my brother and he's a he is a heart doctor and he kinda thought maybe it was n't the heart but[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i did n't hear about that no [Patient] yeah he he he yeah he

and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [Patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [Patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [Patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [Patient] yes yes that's the name of it[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [Patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [Patient] it does[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [Patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to

got the two vaccines you did n't get the booster [Patient] no i did n't get the booster because i really have n't had time to feel that sick again it really knocked me down for like two days and with the little kids it's really hard[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright well i saw that they did a rapid covid test when you came in here and that was negative so that's good so you do n't have covid which is which is good now let's talk a little bit about your hypertension and hypertension since i have you here did you ever buy that blood pressure cuff that i asked you to buy [Patient] yes i did i blood the blood pressure cuff and my blood pressure is like all over the place sometimes it could be like one twenty for the top number sometimes it could be one forty for the top number i i do n't really remember the bottom number though[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay that's okay are you taking the lisinopril i think we have you on twenty milligrams a day [Patient] yep i take it every morning with my multivitamin and my vitamin d[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright and are you watching your salt intake [Patient] i really like my chips with my wine[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] is n't that the best we we could get along really well outside of here alright and then tell me a little bit about your diabetes now are you are you watching your blood sugars are you taking them at home [Patient] sometimes i take that all that often again that could be all over the place sometimes i get if i take it first thing in the morning it'll be like eighty or ninety but at night sometimes it could be one forty[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright and i are you still taking the metformin we have you on a thousand milligrams twice a day [Patient] uh uh yes i do take it i take it with my breakfast and with my dinner[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay alright great alright now are you are you a meds fan or a yankie's fan or god for a bit of filly's fan [Patient] nope[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] do n't like sports just the wine [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam now i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking here first at your vital signs your vital signs look pretty good you do have a low-grade fever of about a hundred . four right now but otherwise your blood pressure is pretty good it's about one thirty two over eighty and your heart rate is eighty four now that looks pretty good so i'm just gon na go ahead and examine you so on your facial exam i'm gon na just press on your face here does this hurt [Patient] no not no it does n't bother me[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay on facial examination the patient has no pain to palpation of the frontal or maxillary sinuses on nasal examination there is edema and erythema of the nasal turbinates bilaterally with associated clear discharge open up your mouth and say [Patient] ah[SEP][Physical Examination][Medication][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] on throat examination there is bilateral erythema and edema of the peritonsillar space with exudates present bilaterally the uvula is midline on your neck exam i do appreciate some cervical lymphadenopathy on the right hand side on your lung exam your lungs you have some coarse rhonchi at the bases that clear with cough and on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur or or rub so what does all of that mean teresa so all of that means is that yes you're showing signs of what we call an upper respiratory infection and i'm concerned that you might have some strep in the back of your throat based on the findings so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you okay so for your first problem of your sore throat i'm gon na go ahead and have the medical assistant come in and swab you for a rapid strep test and if that's positive i wan na go ahead and place you on or prescribe amoxicillin five hundred milligrams three times a day for ten days and i'm gon na give you some lidocaine swish and swallow so that will help with some of the pain and you can take some ibuprofen as needed which will also help with the pain and some of that fever okay i do want you to go ahead and continue to to hydrate as much as possible what kind of questions do you have about that [Patient] no that sounds good i just wanted to be sure i was okay because of the little kids[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] sure now for your next problem of your hypertension i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel on you and i think i do wan na increase i do wan na increase the lisinopril to forty milligrams once a day just to get your blood pressure under better control and we'll see how you do on the forty milligrams once a day for your third problem of your diabetes let's go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and just to make sure that we do n't have to make any adjustments to your metformin how does that sound [Patient] sounds good[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] any questions [Patient] nope that's everything[SEP]","138":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] morning roy , how are you doing ? [Patient] hey , good to see you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] so , my nurse told you a little bit about dax ? so , if you do n't mind , i'm going to tell dax a little bit about you today . [Patient] perfect .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] great , great . so , roy is a 50-year-old male patient who comes in with a history of depression , you had some , um , high blood pressure and some hypertension . so , tell me how have you been doing? [Patient] sure . so it's been a , a pretty stressful winter and spring . and , uh , we've been onboarding a couple new employees and we have been pretty short-staffed in the meantime .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] um , any changes in , um , weight gain or anything like that ? [Patient] probably for the last month or so , we've been hosting some friends over vacation , and on ... you know , at the beach in the summer , so the diet is off the charts .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . okay . gotcha , gotcha . [Patient] out the window .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] out the window . okay . and , um , now i know you've had a history of depression . you're on zoloft , uh , 50 milligrams a day . have you been doing okay with that ? [Patient] uh , for the most part . again , it's been kind of a challenging year-and-a-half or so .[SEP]","139":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 . hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ? [Patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [Patient] yes , i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [Patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Other Socials][Doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [Patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 . [Patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yep , right here . [Patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [Patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .[SEP][Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [Patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [Patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , good . [Patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ? [Patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ... [Patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [Patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you . [Patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated . [Patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [Patient] okay , thank you . got it .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ? [Patient] no , not that i know of .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . [Patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ? [Patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay . we might give you some of that . [Patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ? [Patient] yes , i also do have that problem .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that . [Patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , sounds good . [Patient] great .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [Patient] okay , i will do that .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future . [Patient] okay , that's okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not . [Patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range . [Patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [Patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .[SEP][Personal History][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [Patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , this is much better . [Patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [Patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [Patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [Patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started . [Patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] does that make sense ? [Patient] yes , it does .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study . [Patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you . [Patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify . [Patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up . [Patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you . [Patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be . [Patient] okay , will do .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know . [Patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets . [Patient] okay , sounds good .[SEP]","140":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12\/27\/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ? [Patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad . [Patient] yes , that's correct .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ? [Patient] yeah , that sounds good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today . [Patient Guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense . [Patient Guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wow . okay . [Patient Guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ? [Patient Guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel . [Patient Guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mhm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ? [Patient Guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] got you . okay . [Patient Guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] hmm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Chitchat][Doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ? [Patient Guest] only pepcid .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ? [Patient Guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ? [Patient Guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ? [Patient Guest] yes , that is correct . he did .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ? [Patient Guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that . [Patient Guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care . [Patient Guest] you're welcome .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ? [Patient Guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned . [Patient Guest] um , this is what she sent me , \" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . \" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ? [Patient Guest] correct . yep .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did . [Patient Guest] yes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ? [Patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ? [Patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ? [Patient] no , not that i've noticed .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um- [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today . [Patient Guest] okay . thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Other Treatments][Doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead . [Patient Guest] okay . that sounds good .[SEP]","141":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] so donna is a 37 -year-old female she is here with complaint of

[Patient] i'm okay .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good . how have you been feeling ? [Patient] not so good .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah , so my nurse told me you have been going out to eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp . [Patient] yeah , i have .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that . [Patient] no , it does n't like it at all .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Drug History][Doctor] yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol . and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps , or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea . [Patient] i've been getting both .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . um , so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ? [Patient] i'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and are they soft stools or formed stools ? [Patient] um , they're formed .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and after you have gone out either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ? [Patient] yeah , i do .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Drug History][Doctor] okay . do you feel it's the food or the alcohol or both ? [Patient] uh , well usually we go to friday's restaurant . i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce . [Patient] but it normally does n't bother me .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ? [Patient] most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer patron , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . um , every now and again , i'll drink a martini .sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks , but it can be a variety of things .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ? [Patient] um , no . i guess i need to find a new drink .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and how is it during the week ? [Patient] like what i eat ?[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah , and with the diarrhea and abdomal- um , abdominal pain . [Patient] right now , i'm still having the cramping and sharp pains , so i've been avoiding heavy foods . i did have some fried chicken today , though .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and was everything all right after that ? [Patient] yeah , for the most part .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . remember , it's also the portion sizes . so i mean , if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay . you have to just really watch the portions . [Patient] okay , good . i ca n't go out- go without some fried chicken at least once in a while .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] sounds good . all right , well let's take a look at you today , and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions , and we will discuss once we have finished the exam . [Patient] sounds good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . all right . i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . all right , so if you could just lay back for me , and i'll examine your abdomen . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . do you have any tenderness ? [Patient] no , not really .[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Medication][Doctor] okay . so the abdomen is soft , non-tender . no masses or organomegaly . and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . all right . you can go ahead and sit up now . thank you . all right , so first i want you to try citrucel . it does come in a tablet . you should use it twice daily for regularity . then i would say , if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 milligrams . you can do one tablet before you eat , and then repeat up to four times daily . and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything . um , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later , and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine . [Patient] okay , that sounds good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . and so your bentyl , that's the anti-spasm medication , and i would take the higher dose . [Patient] can i get a refill of that ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse . [Patient] yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] okay , and you can take it , but before you do , we want to try to reduce the triggers . uh , so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . and so , however , if it is not just these isolated inci- incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long term medication that would take ... that you would take every night . and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ? [Patient] i was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , there is . and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ? [Patient] that sounds like a much better plan .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , great . we can definitely do that . uh , just take it every night before bedtime . [Patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you so much .[SEP]","154":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] um , hi mrs. anderson . right ?

[Patient] and , uh , i do n't know . maybe i must have toppled over into some weird position , so it started to pain since then , uh , because of a certain move .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , uh- [Patient] i went overboard , i think . yeah .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , lem me , uh , take a quick look . uh , can you move up a little bit ? yeah .

[Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] so i would , uh , suggest you continue using the pain reliever , maybe just like 600 milligram of ibuprofen three times a day and use it for a week .

Examination][Doctor] okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal [Patient] okay go ahead sorry[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Referral][Doctor] that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me [Patient] yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will

you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here [Patient] no[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Referral][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help [Patient] any questions[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Referral][Doctor] yeah i mean is this do we have to do any more tests or anything what are you we're gon na do an arterial ultrasound i'm going to go ahead and order an arterial ultrasound of your lower extremities to see what the blood supply is like and then i'm gon na go ahead and order a podiatry consult because i want them to see this wound and improve the wound care that you're doing and then for your next problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and talk to your primary care physician we need to get your diabetes better controlled because that impacts your wound healing as well okay [Patient] sure[SEP][Reassessment][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] sure

Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numb numbness or tingling [Patient] no no numbness[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright any loss in sensation [Patient] no i mean i i can still feel like i can still feel my foot[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay alright that's good to hear so you were playing tennis is that what you normally do to work out [Patient] i do i'm trying to learn but i can not afford tennis less lessons so me and my friends just hit the balls back and forth i do sleep[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i love it absolutely yeah my dad one time took me to play racquet ball and i learned the very bruisy way that that was n't for me yeah [Patient] that scares me[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] it's it they they move pretty fast i'm not gon na lie alright so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my my physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings but if you have any questions go ahead stop me let me know but i will be explaining along the way okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so i've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great you know your blood pressure i see is one twenty five over seventy that's almost textbook respiratory rate we are seeing you at a smooth eighteen excuse me your temperature you're running normal ninety seven . one you're you're satting at a hundred percent so and then your pulse so that's interesting like you're you're going at like about sixty beats a minute so i think they're i think we're doing pretty well i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop we have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam i do appreciate a little bit of stridor that's really interesting but i do n't hear any wheezes or rales so that's great for your i know this sounds weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt [Patient] no uh uh[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Radiology Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions [Patient] yeah do i have to do the surgery[SEP]","163":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] next patient is melissa sanchez . date of birth , 9\/23\/1962 . mrn : 5484367 . she is being seen in office today for

[Patient] i'm trying to back off of it . i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure . [Patient] sounds good .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] are you doing any exercise ? [Patient] i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great . [Patient] good to hear .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts . [Patient] nope . nowhere .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ? [Patient] uh , no .[SEP][Discussion][Reassessment][Doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone . [Patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try . [Patient] all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room . [Patient] all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay . [Patient] all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon . [Patient] i'll definitely let you know if that happens .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better . um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged . um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure . [Patient] i understand .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise . um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure . [Patient] really ? i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah , yeah . it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium . um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that . um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information . um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff . [Patient] okay . i'll definitely check that out .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Referral][Medication][Doctor] all right . so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes . uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic . [Patient] all right .[SEP]","170":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hi richard how are you the medical assistant told me that you have a tick bite is that what happened

checking your blood pressure at home [Patient] periodically yes[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and do you think that they are running okay [Patient] yeah blood pressure seems to be doing okay the lisinopril works well[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] good i was just gon na ask you if you were taking your lisinopril so that's good okay and any side effects from the lisinopril since we started it i think we started it about a year ago two years ago [Patient] no no no side effects that i'm aware of[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] no side effects okay and then in terms of your diabetes are you watching your sugar intake [Patient] yeah i usually watch it the form of high what i'm eating but[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i am a big pie fan as well i know what's your favorite type of pie [Patient] well you know it's favorite boy i just like pie you know apples cherry chocolate you know bicon[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i like it too alright are you taking the metformin twice a day [Patient] not everyday but most of the time[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright and are you checking your blood sugars pretty regularly [Patient] i try to[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and do you do you know on average how they're running are they running below like one fifty or [Patient] yeah it's definitely running below that[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay your blood sugars are running below [Patient] it's it's probably with with with the metformin it seems to be you know one twenty[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good your blood sugars are running in the one twenties that's really good okay alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good i do think you're doing a good job with taking your lisinopril your blood pressure's about one twenty two over seventy right now which is right where we want it your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty seven again which is right where we want it and i do n't appreciate any fever today you you have a normal temperature at ninety eight . four which is really good so i'm just gon na be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally on your right knee exam i do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance over your right patella now does it hurt when i press [Patient] it's a little bit sore[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all [Patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Medication][Doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so do you have any questions about that [Patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just[SEP][Reassessment][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Medication][Doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound [Patient] that's fine[SEP][Reassessment][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Medication][Doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound [Patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable [Patient] okay that'd be good[SEP]","171":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , susan , how are you ?

julia jones , date of birth 5\/16\/1996 . she is a new breast reduction consult . hello , how are you doing today ? i'm dr. gonzalez . it's nice to meet you . [Patient] nice to meet you , ma'am . how are you ?[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] i'm doing good , thank you . so you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ? [Patient] yes . that's right .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . perfect . let me just get logged in , here . have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ? [Patient] no , i have n't .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and how long have you been considering this ? [Patient] it's probably been about six or seven years . but i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure . [Patient] okay , that's reassuring .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah . so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having . and then i'll do a quick exam . [Patient] okay . that sounds good .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails . and , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ? [Patient] i have blue cross blue shield . well , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .[SEP][Discussion][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company . and what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not . but we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you'll be on the new plan ? [Patient] most likely july .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ? [Patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . i do have a lotta pain here and here . but i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not . it gets painful and builds up . so i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and in your neck and your upper back . and how long has this been going on ? would you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ? [Patient] i would say since i was in high school .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup . [Patient] yes . i do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often . i mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable . and the others are expensive in my size .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ? [Patient] no , i do not have any kids now . but we might plan to in the future .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ? [Patient] sometimes , yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating . [Patient] no , but they are always sweaty .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ? [Patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ? [Patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ? [Patient] mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ? [Patient] yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] congratulations . that's great . and then , um- [Patient] thank you .[SEP][Other Socials][Drug History][Doctor] . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ? [Patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast . [Patient] okay . that's fine .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well . [Patient] right .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery . [Patient] okay . well , thank you for explaining that .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line . [Patient] okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility . [Patient] okay , yeah , that sounds good .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breastfeed after a breast reduction , and the reason is the breast is made up of fat . and it's also made up of a gland . and the gland is what produces the milk . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated . [Patient] yeah . i do n't know if i'm interested in breastfeeding .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . um , the hormones of pregnancy , though , will change the breasts , so that's just something to be aware of , and i tell all younger patients that . [Patient] okay , yeah . absolutely .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you'll have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple . generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction . and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised , and then it just takes some time for that to go away . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP]","177":"[Conversation Start][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] . next patient is michelle king . date of birth : 05\/07\/1982 . please use toc template . she was admitted to district regional hospital on 06\/29\/2021 , and was discharged on 07\/02\/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to , uh , prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ?

[Patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high . [Patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] typically , it does n't . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive . [Patient] yeah , that's what they said .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ... [Patient] hm .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] uh , they did n't do a ct scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ? [Patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in . [Patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , maybe that's all it was . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ? [Patient] yes , i am .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] great . so here are my thoughts . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ? [Patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ? [Patient] sure , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see . [Patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing . [Patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ? [Patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ? [Patient] i am unvaccinated .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ? [Patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] correct , we do n't . [Patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as \" vaccine injury \" .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] right . [Patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that . [Patient] all of them ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ? [Patient] no , i do n't .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint . [Patient] well , i am open-minded to this .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] the er is full of these vaccines . [Patient] i understand .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion . [Patient] well , that's what i'm here for .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","178":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi andrea , how are you ?

worse in the morning worse in the evening is there anything else that makes it better or worse [Patient] it's definitely worse in the evening[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and do you feel any sort of tightness in the back of your neck or in your shoulders or you know you said it's in the back of your head primarily any discomfort anywhere else [Patient] yes no just in the back of my head[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and did the headache start all of a sudden carolyn or has it been gradual or what [Patient] i've been under a lot of stress lately so maybe about when some stress started occurring[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay okay and alright and have you noticed any fever along with the headache [Patient] no no fever[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and any visual changes you know wavy lines in your vision spots in your vision or anything like that [Patient] no[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and have you had headaches like this before [Patient] i have[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so this is n't the worst headache you've ever had what did you say [Patient] no it's not[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright and so okay fair enough

has[SEP]","180":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on [Patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta [Patient] yes and and fish oil[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that [Patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy[SEP][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so [Patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging [Patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then[SEP][Referral][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time [Patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack[SEP][Referral][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies [Patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty[SEP]","181":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hi , bryan

your abdominal exam your abdomen is nontender and nondistended i do n't appreciate any masses or any rebound or guarding on your prostate exam i do appreciate an enlarged prostate i do n't appreciate any masses on physical exam so what what does that mean billy so that ultimately means that you know everything looks good you know you have that little heart murmur which i believe you you've had in the past but we're gon na go ahead and look into that you know your prostate seems a little bit enlarged to me on physical exam so let's talk about how we can go about and and remedy that okay so for your first problem of this you know difficulty urinating i wan na go ahead and just order some routine labs i wan na get a a psa that kind of that ultimately kinda looks for prostate cancer issues which i do n't think you have because we did n't really appreciate that on physical exam i wan na go ahead and we can try to start you on what we call flomax zero point four milligrams once a day you should take it at night because it can cause people to get a little bit dizzy if they take it in the morning so i would take it at night and i wan na go ahead and refer you to a urologist just to look into this more so we can go ahead and and get this problem solved for you okay i'm also gon na go ahead and just order some routine blood tests just to make sure that we are not missing anything do you have any questions about that and i wan na go ahead and order a urinalysis and a urine culture [Patient] yeah so sounds good have you seen that commercial for that super batter prostate stuff does that work[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] well i think the data it's it's i'm not really sure if it works or not i'm not that familiar with it let's just go ahead and stick with flomax and that's why we are gon na refer you to the urologist so that they can go ahead and talk to you about you know the most current treatment options for you okay [Patient] alright[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] alright for your second problem of your coronary artery disease i wan na go ahead and order an echocardiogram just to follow up on that heart murmur that you had and i wan na go ahead and continue you on the lipitor forty milligrams a day and the aspirin and the metoprolol and i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel any questions about that [Patient] nope[SEP]","197":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey matthew how're you doing [Patient] hey doc i'm doing pretty good how are you[SEP][Acute

admitted to district regional hospital on 06\/29\/2021 , and was discharged on 07\/02\/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to , uh , prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ? [Patient] not too bad . and yourself ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ? [Patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on . [Patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high . [Patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] typically , it does n't . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive . [Patient] yeah , that's what they said .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ... [Patient] hm .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] uh , they did n't do a ct scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ? [Patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in . [Patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , maybe that's all it was . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ? [Patient] yes , i am .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you .

[Patient] okay .[SEP]","199":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] hey linda good to see you today so looking here in my notes looks like you you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on [Patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go [Patient] it's constant[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright are you able to urinate [Patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes [Patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] third time alright [Patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever [Patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain [Patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved [Patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day [Patient] yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so we are getting close there [Patient] okay[SEP][Therapeutic History][Reassessment][Acute Assessment][Doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff [Patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running [Patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the the one eighties which was really high [Patient] right[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that [Patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries[SEP][Discussion][Chitchat][Doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help [Patient] yeah some help could be helpful[SEP][Reassessment][Referral][Medication][Doctor] okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright. so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday [Patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday [Patient] i do[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Physical Examination][Doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain [Patient] no chest pain[SEP]","200":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] good morning rebecca , nice to see you .

[Patient Guest] where's mama ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too . [Patient Guest] yeah , it's okay buddy .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over . [Patient Guest] dino , you're doing so good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down . [Patient Guest] hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like . [Patient Guest] all right . thank you .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine . you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well . [Patient Guest] okay . okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough . [Patient Guest] mm-hmm , got it .[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough . [Patient Guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine . [Patient Guest] okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yes , zarbee's . [Patient Guest] and then you said , uh , which medicine to give him just in case ?[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP]","204":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] morning roy , how are you doing ?

there and take a look at their sales and and see if you ca n't finish your remodeled project [Patient] that sounds great i'll have to take a look at the flooring as well[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] that sounds good so now just out of curiosity are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in in your arm or hand [Patient] i did when i initially hurt it but i'm not no longer having any numbness or tingling[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Radiology Examination][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay so a little bit about my physical exam i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you today now your vitals look good but specifically on your right shoulder exam you do have limited active and passive range of motion and there is tenderness to the greater tuberosity of the humerus now there is no tenderness at your sternoclavicular joint and you do have good strong bilateral hand grips and on your neurovascular exam of your right arm you do have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds and you do have equal and bilateral response to sensation and touch which is good now taking a look at your x-ray that we did when you came in today good news is that right shoulder x-ray reveals no fracture or bony abnormality mkay so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now i your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy i think that you've injured the tendons of the muscles that make up the shoulder so that i think that's that's why you are having the that shoulder pain i do wan na order an mri of that right shoulder just to make sure that nothing else is going on now i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy and that's gon na be about six to eight weeks now my patients are very successful with their pt and let's see how you do before we make the decision that we would do additional treatment such as a steroid injection to that shoulder i do want you to continue to take an nsaid if you can tolerate tylenol i want you to go ahead and take tylenol for that pain do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan [Patient] no i think it sounds good ca n't wait to to get some relief[SEP]","207":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] hey matthew how is it going good to see you today i see here in your notes

[Patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .

[Patient] not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even thought i've never been diagnosed with it .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi cancer or liver disease ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ? [Patient] i've never had any surgery .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all those are still intact ? [Patient] yup .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ? [Patient] no . i thought that happen when you turn 50 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well , that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy , like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants . [Patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain . [Patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ? [Patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ? [Patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ?

[Patient] no .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice . [Patient] what would cause that ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted . [Patient] that's good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly . [Patient] what's that ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon . [Patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged . [Patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] correct . [Patient] so what does that mean ?[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged . [Patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ?[SEP][Medication][Acute Assessment][Doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that . [Patient] so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ?[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease . [Patient] so what do i need to do ?[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs . [Patient] okay . and then what ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too . [Patient] which medications ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ? [Patient] about 18 months .[SEP]","211":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , martha . how are you ?

[Patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [Patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .[SEP][Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [Patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?

[Patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ... [Patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [Patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you . [Patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated . [Patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .

[Patient] none whatsoever .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and how about your ... your acid reflux ? how are you doing with ... i know you were making some diet changes . [Patient] yeah , i've been pretty good with the diet , but with the pain i have been having, it has been easier to call and have something delivered. so i have been ordering a lot of take-out and fast food that can be delivered to my door so i don't have to go out and up and down the steps to get it myself. but other than that , it's been pretty good .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . are you staying hydrated ?

[Patient] sure .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] hey , dragon ? show me the creatinine . so we ... we drew a creatinine when you came in here because i was concerned about the kidney stones . it ... it is uh ... it is up slightly , which might suggest that you have a little bit of a obstruction there of one- [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Lab Examination][Radiology Examination][Doctor] . of the stones . okay ? hey , dragon . show me the abdominal x-rays . okay , and there might be a question of a ... uh , of a stone there lower down , uh , but we'll wait for the official read there . so the , uh , abdominal x-rays show a possible kidney stone , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you . so , for your first problem , your back pain , i think you're having a recurrence of your kidney stones . so i wan na go ahead and order a ct scan without contrast of your abdomen and pelvis . okay ? [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Medication][Acute Assessment][Doctor] and i'm also gon na order you some ultram 50 milligrams as needed every six hours for pain . does that sound okay ?

inhaler are you using now [Patient] i have an albuterol inhaler[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night [Patient] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens [Patient] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like

happening[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler [Patient] okay[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so you use you're using two puffs of the

my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere [Patient] no not really[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay any numbness any tingling [Patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well [Patient] yeah it does[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like [Patient] not without extreme pain[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up [Patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt [Patient] yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright and then lateral as well [Patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist [Patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you [Patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down [Patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better[SEP][Physical Examination][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to [Patient] i'm sorry[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] pardon what [Patient] a what[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace [Patient] okay thank you[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay [Patient] when do i have to have the surgery[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] alright so what [Patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks [Patient] six weeks[SEP][Referral][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of [Patient] oof[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions [Patient] no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go

that's okay it happens i know things you know you're you're busy but you know we do want i do want you to stay healthy you know you're you are a patient of mine i want i want to continue to see you over a long period of time so it's important for you to to you know watch your diet you know because we can have some complications from diabetes like kidney dysfunction and eye problems and things like that and i know that you are 74 and you know you have n't really had a lot of issues up until this point and you know so you have a you know still a long life to live so i would like to see you you know try to you know monitor your diet and and your blood sugars are you taking the metformin [Patient] yeah i think that's the big pill[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay i'm not really sure what it looks like but you're supposed to be taking a thousand milligrams twice a day are you taking it twice a day [Patient] yeah i'm taking my wife puts in the my box i take something twice a day i know that[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay how is your wife doing she is a very lovely person i i i remember seeing her at your last visit [Patient] she is doing fine[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yeah i say the same thing to my husband okay well let's go ahead i wanted you to just do a quick physical exam so i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so looking here at your vital signs you know you do n't have a fever here in the office which is good your temperature is ninety eight . four on your blood pressure it seems like you are doing a pretty good job monitoring your blood pressure your blood pressure is right where it should be it's about one twenty five over sixty two which is good your heart rate is nice and slow in the eighties and your oxygenation is fine it's ninety seven percent on room air so all of that is is really good now on on your facial exam i'm just pressing on your face here do you have any pain to palpation [Patient] just right underneath my eyes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] on one on what side [Patient] actually both[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay okay on on facial examination the patient has pain to palpation of the bilateral maxillary sinuses on nasal exam there are there is erythema and edema of the nasal turbinates bilaterally with associated yellow discharge on throat exam can you open up your mouth on your throat exam the the uvula is midline there is no erythema or edema or exudate in the peritonsillar space on neck examination i do appreciate some bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and on your lung exam there is coarse rhonchi present bilaterally that clears with cough on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur and on your right knee exam does it hurt when i press here [Patient] yep[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay there is pain to palpation on the right knee and i'm just gon na move it all around does that hurt [Patient] little bit yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay so there is decreased flexion and extension of the right knee there is associated ecchymosis to the right medial knee there is no evidence of an effusion okay so billy what does all of that mean that means that you just have signs of that you have a little bit of an upper respiratory infection that might have caused some congestion in your in your lungs which we will talk about okay and then and as far as your knee exam it just shows that you do have some inflammation and some evidence that you had injured it earlier so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you for all of these issues okay so for your first problem of your cough you know i do believe that you just have a a viral syndrome at this time you probably have some mild bronchitis i really just wan na go ahead and just you know recommend some supportive care you can continue to take over the counter medications we can prescribe guaifenesin six hundred six hundred milligrams twice a day to help cough up some of that phlegm and i do n't think you need need any antibiotics at this time but certainly if your symptoms worsen i want you to call me and then we can go ahead and consider ordering a chest x-ray to make sure that you do n't have any pneumonia okay how does that sound [Patient] that sounds good[SEP]","233":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on [Patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta [Patient] yes and and fish oil[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that [Patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy[SEP][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so [Patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging [Patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then[SEP][Referral][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time [Patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack[SEP][Referral][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies [Patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking [Patient] i thought it was close to sixty[SEP][Other Treatments][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet [Patient] yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results[SEP][Personal History][Lab Examination][Doctor] i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist [Patient] oh[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] that's your kidney doctor [Patient] i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil [Patient] right yeah that's i threw all of those out[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span [Patient] i'm a more of a san francisco fan[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again [Patient] okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches[SEP]","234":"[Conversation Start][Acute

stopped as quickly as i could[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay now are you able to take tylenol do you not feel any relief from tylenol when you take it [Patient] yeah tylenol's lovely it just is not very effective[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright yeah because i think we really want you to stay away from that those anti-inflammatories because that can make your kidney function worse and obviously you know we do n't wan na see you go on dialysis or anything like that so we'll have [Patient] mean neither[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] right so we'll have to you know really work on that now tell me a little bit about are you watching the potassium and stuff in your diet [Patient] nobody's really talked to me about that so[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay yeah so you want [Patient] i did n't know what high potassium foods are[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay i'm sorry i've never talked to you about that in the past i that's my fault so yeah so you wan na make sure you stay away from things like bananas oranges you know potatoes have lots of potassium that type of thing and so you know because with your kidney function you know that can cause your potassium levels to go up because you do n't get rid of the potassium as you should you know [Patient] something to eat[SEP]","240":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Lab Examination][Doctor] next patient is paul edwards , date of birth is january 15th 1962 . so he's a 59 year old hiv positive gentleman here for hypogonadism . patient was last seen on november 24th 2020 . his notable things are number one , he is on 1 milliliter every 10 days , uh , his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he's on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily so he takes all his pills just from me . um , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia which is ... which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500 . hey , how are you today ? [Patient] all right , how have you been ?[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm good . [Patient] good , good .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle ? you look trim . [Patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt . makes you look thin . [Patient] yeah , i guess that's it .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ? [Patient] good , the testosterone's going well .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] that's great . [Patient] uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , well that's good . [Patient] so the finasteride i'm only taking half a pill , it's the 5 milligram one .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that . [Patient] and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] in and out . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there . [Patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ? [Patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] right . [Patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] wow , that's remarkable . [Patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .[SEP][Discussion][Lab Examination][Doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it . [Patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference . [Patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] absolutely . [Patient] my red blood cell count has increased .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though . [Patient] stable .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think . [Patient] yeah . , is it ?[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good . [Patient] nice , that's good news .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so . [Patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me . [Patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] well , your levels are high . [Patient] are they right now ?[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] well , i mean they were last time . [Patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ? [Patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] all right . [Patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","241":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi keith , how are you ?

[Patient] yes . it's doing much better .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ? [Patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , that sounds good . [Patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ? [Patient] no , i'm not right now .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication . [Patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel . [Patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . [Patient] okay . i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? [Patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?

[Patient] not too bad . and yourself ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ? [Patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on . [Patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high . [Patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] typically , it does n't . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive . [Patient] yeah , that's what they said .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ... [Patient] hm .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] uh , they did n't do a ct scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ? [Patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in . [Patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , maybe that's all it was . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ? [Patient] yes , i am .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] great . so here are my thoughts . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ? [Patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ? [Patient] sure , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see . [Patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing .

ca n't get this ulcer to heal[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay how long has that wound been present [Patient] maybe about a year[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] a year well that that's a that's a a long time so when it started i guess did you have any trauma to the foot or did was it just all of a sudden [Patient] no trauma it just it seemed like a little blister and then i picked at it and it did get a little bit red and infected so i talked to my primary about it[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay when was the last time you were on antibiotics [Patient] it's probably been five months[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] five months alright do you remember which antibiotics you were on [Patient] keflex[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] keflex alright so kinda does your foot hurt or is it just just the [Patient] no pain but i do n't have much feeling in my foot[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] alright so you've got neuropathy yeah that that that makes sense with the the diabetes so have you had any other symptoms like a fever chills any drainage coming from it [Patient] lately there has been a lot more drainage and i just feel a little more tired[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay alright well that that sounds good so today is thursday so what do you have for the weekend [Patient] not too much i'll probably be walking around at the zoo on this ulcer all weekend and eating out and not doing anything my doctor wants me to do[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] no yeah i yeah i know you do have that diabetes i know your pcp probably would n't be excited about you you eating out and all that but you know hopefully we can we i can at least get your your foot a little bit better so your diabetes i know we talked a little bit earlier how is that going for you is it controlled you know what's your your blood sugars running [Patient] yeah they are running better than they were but they are still in the two hundreds so my doctor does n't like that my last a1c was about ten[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright yeah i i you probably definitely need to get back with your pcp about that because the a1c is is pretty high and i know he probably had you on some medication and insulin and metformin and insulin just to try to to get that lower but [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] you know we are here for your foot so let's let me take a look at that so we will do a quick exam of your foot so you do n't have any fever your vitals look good so on your your right foot exam i can see here you do have a one by two centimeter two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint i do see some yellow slough that's present with minimal granulation tissue you have no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there is n't any evidence of fluid collection i do n't see necrosis so there is no dead tissue around it there's no odor and i i do n't appreciate any bony exposure and does it hurt when i touch it here [Patient] no[SEP][Discussion][Radiology Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay so we did a x-ray of your right foot before you came in and it showed no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that there is no bone infection which is really good so let me just talk a little about my assessment and plan of your your foot so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer so what i'm gon na do is i'm going to order a abi or ankle brachial index and that's just to determine your blood supply just to see if we can actually heal that wound i know it's been there for about a year which is a pretty long time and so we just need to see if we can if you do have that blood flow just in case we need to to make other goals for that foot just to depend upon that i'm also gon na do a debridement here have you had that done before of the [Patient] yes i think so[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay so you know you know pretty much about that so i'm just gon na try to take off some of that dead tissue we'll do that here in the office afterwards and then i'm going to prescribe you some colaganase ointment and you could just add that to your wound once a day and cover it with a sterile dressing and we're gon na try to continue that until we see it start to shrink and hopefully you know that will work between the debridement and then the ointment did they give you at your pcp they give you a surgical shoe or have you been wearing your regular shoes [Patient] i've just been wearing my regular shoes[SEP]","252":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] so jerry is a 45 -year-old male who came in today with an ankle injury jerry what happened [Patient] hey doctor michael yeah so my son sean i think you met in the past he he started playing basketball and there we do multiple seasons and so we're kinda getting ready for the next season that starts in in april and we were at the courts plan and i went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers i guess he could say and so he he found me while i was going for a lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way [Patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad [Patient] yeah yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too [Patient] yeah a little bit[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all [Patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable [Patient] yeah[SEP][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches [Patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] alright well [Patient] how long[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again [Patient] okay[SEP][Medication][Doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly [Patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah i i'm a dog walker as well so alright sorry for the bad news but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do [Patient] alright thank you doctor[SEP]","253":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , anna . how are you ?

my body hurts i told you my neck hurts[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay so i no i'm absolutely i wan na make sure that we are gon na give you the medication that works like the best for you so i'm sorry if these questions seem like frustrating i would just wan na make sure that i understand what the problem is so [Patient] i saw pamela and doctor collins's office she's much nicer than you know[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Doctor] i mean okay so you know what like maybe maybe pamela would be better like we could maybe talk talk about a referral if that would make you more comfortable [Patient] my lawyer told me to come here[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] then you're stuck with me okay i'm so sorry but here it's we're gon na try and make it as good as possible alright so last thing i do wan na do my physical exam alright and i need you to let me know as as much as you as much as you can verbalize right so when i push here in the middle of your neck on top of the bone does it hurt [Patient] yes yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright sorry what about on the side does that hurt [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so pain on palpation both on the bony process and on the muscle can you move your neck from side to side can you move your neck can you swive it side to side no no alright so i'm i'm seeing i'm seeing some range of movement moderate range of movement that's fine okay i so when can you bend your neck forward that that's your whole body just just the neck are you capable of bending up [Patient] really hurts it really hurts[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay it really hurts to bend forward and backwards okay alright so i'm just gon na make a little note here i do n't i do n't see any bruising i'm not noticing any swelling there is i i do n't see any laceration what [Patient] just sometimes it bruises[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay sometimes alright that's fine i i just i'm not seeing one here today so that's okay alright so with that being said i do wan na ask have you been experiencing any fatigue are you tired [Patient] well since the accident yes[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] okay alright just making sure okay so this is what this is my assessment and plan this is what we are gon na do i want to be able to like we had you do an x-ray before you came in here and looking at it i'm not noticing any fracture that's a really good sign considering how many car accidents we've been in lately [Patient] it hurts it hurts[SEP]","260":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on [Patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta [Patient] yes and and fish oil[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that [Patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy[SEP][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so [Patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging [Patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then[SEP][Referral][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time [Patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack[SEP][Referral][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies [Patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking [Patient] i thought it was close to sixty[SEP][Other Treatments][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet [Patient] yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results[SEP][Personal History][Lab Examination][Doctor] i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist [Patient] oh[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] that's your kidney doctor [Patient] i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil [Patient] right yeah that's i threw all of those out[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span [Patient] i'm a more of a san francisco fan[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again [Patient] okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] you can take tylenol [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur

[Patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now . [Patient] yes . it's doing much better .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ? [Patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , that sounds good . [Patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ? [Patient] no , i'm not right now .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication . [Patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel . [Patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . [Patient] okay . i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? [Patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ? [Patient] twice a day .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ? [Patient] no , that's fine .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] how often are you using that one ? [Patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ? [Patient] i'm not .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ? [Patient] no wipes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ? [Patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ? [Patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk . [Patient] it is ? okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself . [Patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that . [Patient] yes , i did . thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it . [Patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] let's see . [Patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much . [Patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 . [Patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form . [Patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , mm-hmm . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else . [Patient] can you do the metro market ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find . [Patient] sure .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say . [Patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] correct , it's not a steroid . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad . [Patient] okay . got it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ? [Patient] okay , thank you for explaining .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so i will say , \" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . \" [Patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash. [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ? [Patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you . [Patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day . [Patient] that sounds good .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping . [Patient] okay , sounds good .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here . [Patient] thank you so much .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly . [Patient] sounds good .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream . [Patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well . [Patient] all right .[SEP]","273":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi joyce , how are you ?

Start][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] . next patient is michelle king . date of birth : 05\/07\/1982 . please use toc template . she was admitted to district regional hospital on 06\/29\/2021 , and was discharged on 07\/02\/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to , uh , prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ? [Patient] not too bad . and yourself ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ? [Patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on . [Patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high . [Patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] typically , it does n't . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive . [Patient] yeah , that's what they said .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ... [Patient] hm .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] uh , they did n't do a ct scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ? [Patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in . [Patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , maybe that's all it was . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ? [Patient] yes , i am .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] great . so here are my thoughts . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ? [Patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ? [Patient] sure , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see . [Patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing . [Patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ? [Patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ? [Patient] i am unvaccinated .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ? [Patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] correct , we do n't . [Patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as \" vaccine injury \" .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] right . [Patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay .

[Patient] yes , in my chest and also in my throat .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] in your throat and chest . all right . any difficulty with swallowing ? feels like food or liquids kinda get stuck ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . that's good . any abdominal pain ? [Patient] no , not really .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] nausea or vomiting , changes in bowel movements ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] constipation , diarrhea , rectal bleeding ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . very good . and how long have you had this problem ? [Patient] i've had acid reflux since i was around 12 , but it has gotten worse over the past few years .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and how long have you been on the omeprazole ? [Patient] on the way , it is now i think about a year .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . do you find that it's done anything for you in the past ? [Patient] i mean , i can tell it's helped because some days , i'll be fine , and then some days , i eat something and it feels terrible .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] are there any things that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint , like food choices or stress ? [Patient] sure . probably stress and food choices sometimes .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . what things bother you ? [Patient] spicy foods , um , so i try not to eat them too often , but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that , even sodas . um , even just the carbonation can cause that . how about tomato-based products or citrus products ? [Patient] yeah , sometimes , but i still eat them .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . it's reassuring that you are n't having any difficulty swallowing , though . how's your weight been ? pretty stable ? [Patient] i'd say pretty stable , although i have n't had much of an appetite for the past two months . i have been under a lot of work stress .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] what do you do for work ? [Patient] i'm a paralegal .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and any family history of gi issues ? [Patient] um , my grandmother had esophageal cancer .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] on your mom or dad's side ? [Patient] mom's side . and my mom had some issues like acid reflux , and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . have you ever had an upper endoscopy ? [Patient] i think maybe when i was younger .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but not in the last 10 years ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole ? [Patient] um , at one point i was on omeprazole and ranititine -dine . it did help . but other than that , those are the only medications i have taken .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . have a seat here , and let me listen to your heart and lungs , and then we can talk about a plan for you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] so normal physical exam per my new patient template , except for well-healed abdominal surgical scars noted . what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from ? [Patient] i always forget about that surgery . i had it when i was a baby . my mom said my intestines were twisted , so i had to have surgery when i was around one month old .[SEP][Discussion][Personal History][Medication][Reassessment][Doctor] hm , gotcha . okay . so let's talk about what you have going on . from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several-year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux . and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole , 40 milligrams twice daily . you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Other Treatments][Reassessment][Doctor] and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated bev- beverages , citrus , and tomato-based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet . so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd , even though you're taking the ppi . [Patient] okay , yeah , i could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] great . so stress is another trigger that we need to address . high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms . [Patient] yeah , stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so working on that may help with your gerd . additionally , we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole . if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium . [Patient] that's fine with me . i'm definitely open to trying whatever .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] perfect . i will send a prescription for nexium 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file . i'll also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd , or upper endoscopy , to look for potential causes of the gerd . we'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth , down your throat , through your stomach , and end in the small intestines . we'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything . [Patient] okay . can i schedule that today ?[SEP]","285":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] good morning noah tell me a little bit about why you are here today [Patient] hi document i'm i'm just had you know the back pain you know and i've i've had it for you know about a week and[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay can you tell me a little bit more about it how did it start or how did it do you remember injuring yourself [Patient] no not really i mean i was just like you know i guess i one day i mean i just twisted you know on my left and maybe i mean i might have picked something up[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and is it anywhere in specific is it in the middle of the back across the whole low back or on one side or the other [Patient] i think it's more towards you know right in the middle maybe on the lower side and nothing on the you know i mean it sometimes it goes back you know maybe having troubles with the left eye i suppose but i mean it's aggravated you know when i you know when i do some you know maybe i'm a sudden movement to the left[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and that's when you get the pain more [Patient] maybe located in the center but it goes across to the little back and i on the left side[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i also heard you say you know if you twist suddenly that makes it worse is that correct [Patient] it makes it worse it makes it worse i mean yeah[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] now you know i was looking at your records and i know you have that history of diabetes and i have n't seen you a while for a follow-up for that how you've been feeling [Patient] i mean been okay i mean i take my meds[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so you're on [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yeah i think i think you're on that metformin twice a day [Patient] yeah[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah okay [Patient] yes[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] do you test your blood sugar at home in the mornings [Patient] yeah i mean i try to[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and how have those numbers been [Patient] they bumped towards i mean bit towards the higher side i mean i must have been[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well if [Patient] yeah[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah if i remember right your family do n't they own that that bakery down on the corner of main street and did n't they own that [Patient] yeah thank you[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] and how do you do you stay away from those i i got ta be honest i love i love the cakes and donuts they make those are delicious [Patient] yeah i try to[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] well let me so we're gon na have to watch that and i'll come back and we'll talk a little bit about the diabetes but let's go ahead and do that i do n't wan na do a a a quick physical exam on you i'm gon na look in your eyes here and so let me quickly look in your ears [Patient] i see[SEP]","286":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] patient's name is diana scott . date of birth , 12\/8\/1920 . the date of service is 7\/9\/2021 . this is a new patient note . good afternoon . how are you today ?

you know i'm a little i'm sad to be in here but you know thanks for taking me in i appreciate it[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] sure absolutely what can i help you with today [Patient] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now [Patient] i have an albuterol inhaler[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night [Patient] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens [Patient] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then when you use your inhaler [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] does it does it alleviate the problem [Patient] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler [Patient] okay[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] for the symptoms [Patient] yes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so [Patient] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that [Patient] no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening [Patient] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic

abrasions dry looks about a week week old right over the medial patella everything else looks good no scars okay how about can you straighten it out all the way [Patient] i can but sometimes it like hurts a little bit like it almost like it clicks[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yep that's good though full full extension how far can you bend it [Patient] all the way back[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay let's see [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good good and how about the other side let me see the left knee can you bend that one all the way back too [Patient] yeah that's fine[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay full full symmetric flexion no no deformities go ahead and just let it relax [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] valgus stress medial collateral ligament intact lateral collateral ligament intact okay so little kind of little laxity posterior drawer let me see the other let me see the other knee [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yeah so that that feels pretty much normal so she's got a about a one plus posterior drawer anterior drawer negative lachman negative good let's go ahead and just kinda bend and straighten for me [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good patellar patella tracks fine no crepitus alright let's go back to this medial side you're tender right there is that right [Patient] yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Physical Examination][Doctor] it's tender on the medial joint line but actually negative mcmurray negative lateral side negative mcmurray good so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts [Patient] yeah sometimes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like [Patient] walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] you actually no [Patient] yeah it hurts no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] what about you i mean are you real weak [Patient] no i would say i'm pretty strong[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] did you go to the gym [Patient] i go to the gym but i swim so the[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay i ca n't treat people like you you you you need to work harder [Patient] i quit complaining okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yes sir work harder [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] do you do you play sports in in college or high school [Patient] i did in high school[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids [Patient] no[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] just kinda you're thinking walking the dog [Patient] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee [Patient] no no i have n't would you recommend that[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it's pretty bad [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] we'll get we'll get to that too [Patient] okay[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today [Patient] yes[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay do i go into that to [Patient] yeah[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it [Patient] you're only cup of this[SEP][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Other Treatments][Doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Other Treatments][Doctor] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] does that make sense [Patient] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary [Patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm[SEP]","300":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi logan . how are you ?

me a little bit about what happened [Patient] yeah i was trying to go out and play some pickup soccer games over the weekend and went to go plank kick the ball and and just felt a pop in my right knee[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and and how long ago did that happen [Patient] about three days ago[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] three days okay and when did you notice any swelling anything like that [Patient] it it's swollen some some of that swelling has gone down[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to ten one being the least pain ten being the worst pain how's how's it been ranging [Patient] it's somewhere between six and seven right now it's about four or five with some of the swelling going down[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright and did you take anything at all to relieve the pain [Patient] anti-inflammatories[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alrighty and did that help [Patient] yeah the ibuprofen helped a little bit but i'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] gotcha okay now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then [Patient] i can bend it but it hurts towards the end of the motion and i can straighten it but it does n't it feels like i have to help get it straightened[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright and then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all [Patient] i can still bear weight on it but it feels just really loose it it does n't feel normal[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] gotcha okay alright well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before i take a look at your knee here i'm gon na do a physical exam and in terms of your gait here i did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation so let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick i do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of ecchymosis let me just feel around here scott how does that feel does that hurt when i kinda press on that there [Patient] a little bit of pain there not not really bad it's it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel [Patient] just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam fifty milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan [Patient] it it does now well i need to limit my work activities i i typically sit behind a desk but it's not been very comfortable sitting here lately[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Doctor] yeah definitely so yeah so you you can limit the activities for sure in terms of your work activities i know if you sit too long sometimes it can be painful because you do need to move that leg a little bit so it does n't lock up so i i would like for you to you know do do some slight activities not enough to stress your legs but definitely move move them a little bit every now and then so it does n't lock up on you okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] alright i do want you to i know you are i know you actually jog often so i want you to just slow that down for a bit no jogging for a while until we get you know results of your mri till we figure out what we what we are gon na be doing okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] alright and how's your dog you has it been jogging with you before this

wrap at home i try to do that[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen [Patient] this happened yesterday morning[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry [Patient] yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere [Patient] no not really[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay any numbness any tingling [Patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well [Patient] yeah it does[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like [Patient] not without extreme pain[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up [Patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt [Patient] yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright and then lateral as well [Patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist [Patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you [Patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down [Patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better[SEP][Physical Examination][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to [Patient] i'm sorry[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] pardon what [Patient] a what[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace [Patient] okay thank you[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay [Patient] when do i have to have the surgery[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] alright so what [Patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks [Patient] six weeks[SEP][Referral][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of [Patient] oof[SEP]","309":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey hi bobby how are you doing [Patient] i'm doing good how are you[SEP][Acute

[Patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast . [Patient] okay . that's fine .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well . [Patient] right .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery . [Patient] okay . well , thank you for explaining that .[SEP]","312":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] okay . maria martin , date of birth 03\/05\/1946 , has been informed and consents to have this visit recorded . the patient is here for follow-up . hi , maria . how have you been doing ?

[Patient] yes , ma'am .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] well , it looks like you have one stone in the left kidney but it's not obstructing anything . [Patient] i knew it had to be a kidney stone . i passed what looked like two small stones last week after i scheduled this appointment . and then for the past six weeks , i've had a few episodes of bright red urine the color of , like , cherry kool-aid . and last week , i was constantly having to pee and it hurt something terrible .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] how bad was your pain on a scale of zero to 10 ? zero being no pain and 10 being worse , as you can imagine . [Patient] um , at the time , i'd say an eight .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back ? [Patient] no , after passing those stones , things have felt a lot better .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Vegetative History][Doctor] that's good to hear . now , it looks like you're only taking alavert 10 milligrams a day and have no drug allergies . is that correct ? [Patient] that's right .[SEP][Discussion][Reassessment][Doctor] all right , let's take a look at you today . let's use my default pe . well , mrs. wood , we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones . fortunately , you passed two last week and the blood has nearly subsided . you do still have one stone in the left kidney . since it's not obstructing or causing pain , i do n't recommend any surgical intervention at this time . [Patient] i'd like to know what i can do to stop getting these stones .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] as we discussed last time , the formation of kidney stones can not be attributed to a particular cause . but several factors increase the risk , such as dehydration , family history , certain foods , digestive tract disease and certain medical conditions . [Patient] yeah , i know i do n't drink near the amount of water that i should . i drink more mountain dew than anything .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] you should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day . [Patient] so , if i weight 250 pounds , i should drink ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] that would be 125 ounces of water a day and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like mountain dew . [Patient] okay . is there any food i should n't eat ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] great question . you should avoid food rich in sodium oxalate and animal protein . so that would be salty , processed food because they're high in sodium . ideally , you should consume less than 1,000 milligrams of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef , poultry , fish , and pork . [Patient] what's oxalate ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] it's an organic acid found in plants , that when digested , it binds to minerals that stones are formed from . foods like spinach , chocolate , beets , rhubarb and soy products . [Patient] well , i'll do whatever it takes to try to avoid getting these stones again .[SEP]","314":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi wayne how're you today [Patient] i'm doing okay aside

that[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright tell me have you ever had pain in that shoulder before [Patient] you know i i'm really active and so i i will get some aches and pains here and there but nothing that tylenol ca n't take care of[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay good but now are you able to move your arm [Patient] you know i have trouble when i'm trying to reach for something or lift any objects and i do n't even try to reach it for anything over my head because then it'll really hurt[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright and and now are you having the pain all the time or does it come and go [Patient] the pain is always there and then it gets worse like if i try to put any pressure on it it gets worse so if i'm laying at night if i try to even lay on that shoulder it's unbearable[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and then tell me what have you taken for your pain [Patient] i've been taking two extra strength tylenol every six to eight hours[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] alright and and did that help [Patient] it does take the edge off but i still have some pain[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay well i'm sorry to

numbness in your arms or in your hands [Patient] no no numbness or tingling[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright so let's just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here i did review your vitals everything here looks good now lem me take a look at your shoulder alright now on your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion and how does that feel here [Patient] that hurts[SEP][Physical Examination][Radiology Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay sorry there is tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus but there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints you have good hand grips alright and then now on your neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is intact to light touch alright so what does that all mean well firstly lem me go ahead and take a look at your results of your shoulder x-ray here now i reviewed the results and there are no fractures so that's good so let's go ahead and talk about my assessment and plan here wayne so for your problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured the tendons of the muscles that help make up your shoulder muscles so i will be ordering an mri for your left shoulder to be sure that there is nothing else going on with your shoulder okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Referral][Doctor] now i'm also going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and during that time you may also continue to take tylenol now if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection for your shoulder which can provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan at all [Patient] so do you think this pain will ever go away[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] now well many patients are very successful with the physical therapy those will those help strengthen you know they do a lot of strengthening exercises with you to help strengthen you know your muscles so that it's not your movements not always relying on those joints predominantly so we're gon na go ahead and start with that and then see how you do okay [Patient] okay okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] alright okay well do you have any other questions for me [Patient] no i think that's it[SEP]","315":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hi good afternoon joseph how are you doing today [Patient] i'm doing well but my my big toe hurts and it's a little red too but

pain , who was diagnosed with irritable bowl that was treated with bentyl . she had a previous prescription for reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea . she was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement , such as citrucel , daily , probiotics to help with gas and bloating , bentyl up to four times daily for intestinal cramping , and stop reglan and use zofran as needed . neuromodulators such as elavil and buspar were discussed but not started . hello , how are you ? [Patient] i'm okay .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good . how have you been feeling ? [Patient] not so good .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah , so my nurse told me you have been going out to eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp . [Patient] yeah , i have .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that . [Patient] no , it does n't like it at all .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Drug History][Doctor] yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol . and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps , or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea .

[Patient] but it normally does n't bother me .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ? [Patient] most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer patron , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . um , every now and again , i'll drink a martini .sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks , but it can be a variety of things .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ?

[Patient] no , that's new .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . how is it working for you ? [Patient] my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , \" i can not do this . \" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm . okay . [Patient] and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too . [Patient] i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also . [Patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] hmm , okay . [Patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right . [Patient] yeah , i do n't know .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too . [Patient] i figured maybe that's what it was .[SEP][Personal History][Other Socials][Doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also . [Patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that . [Patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] have you lost weight ?

[Patient] no .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative\/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ? [Patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then . [Patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check . [Patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] have you had the vaccine ?

better[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay the headache has has maybe made you feel uncomfortable and prevented your your exercise would you say or what [Patient] yes it has[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay okay so you probably have n't been out golfing i remember you're a big golfer so not not lately uh so you know being [Patient] not lately[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] being down being down here in florida we got ta get get some golf in so hey did you see the masters by the way a few weeks ago was n't that i do n't know did you happen to catch it [Patient] i did[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yeah that was crazy what a what a finish what an amazing what an amazing tournament right what do you think yeah yeah that's great well we'll we'll get you feeling better and get you back out there and now are you still working a lot on the computer ac or [Patient] i am[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] carolyn okay yeah you're still working a lot on the computer for work okay are you taking breaks every hour or so you know get up stand around walk stand walk around that can be helpful [Patient] no i really do n't get the opportunity to[SEP][Physical Examination][Follow-up][Medication][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Acute Assessment][Doctor] hmmm okay understood alright well listen let's go ahead and examine you okay so so on your physical exam your physical exam is pretty normal unremarkable for the most part and you know few things a few exceptions so first of all on your heent exam your eye exam your extraocular motions are intact without pain you have a funduscopic exam that shows no papilledema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back of your eye and on your neck exam you do have some posterior mild posterior paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well and otherwise on your exam let's see your heart exam on your heart exam you have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam so it just means i hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and i'm not too worried about that we'll watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable and so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan so carolyn for your first problem of the headache i do think that you have a tension type headache and i think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders and you know working at the computer i think is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that tylenol for the pain i'm also gon na give you a mild muscle relaxant i'll write you for flexeril five milligrams three times a day and you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms i want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worsen or you develop a fever but i do n't think that this is a a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that i think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus let's continue you on the metformin five hundred milligrams i am going to order a hemoglobin a1c and also a cbc and a chem-12 to check some of your blood tests blood chemistries and so forth and we will continue you on the metformin i do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful so when you come back in a month i want you to bring those numbers with you we can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine that's really gon na help you keep those blood sugars under control as well okay so how does that sound for a plan any other questions for me [Patient] well would it so only call if if it gets worse or not any better[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Personal History][Doctor] yeah that that just right but also let's set up an appointment in four weeks and i wan na see you back in four weeks if it's not if the headache is not better within the next few days with this flexeril then you can give us a call and and get back in later this week or early next but definitely if things get worse give us a call sooner and you know i meant to ask you on i wanted to ask if you had a history of any any trauma meaning have you hit your head or you have n't fallen hit your head or anything like that have you [Patient] no no i think it's just stress[SEP]","331":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] morning christine , nice to see you .

in your right coronary artery i know that the pumping function of your heart was a little low you know that what we call that ejection fraction was about thirty five percent have you been watching

week ago some pain in my feet actually and i i had to take motrin to get rid of it so yeah i took motrin for a while and i stopped as quickly as i could[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay now are you able to take tylenol do you not feel any relief from tylenol when you take it [Patient] yeah tylenol's lovely it just is not very effective[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright yeah

and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [Patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [Patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [Patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [Patient] yes yes that's the name of it[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [Patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [Patient] it does[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [Patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [Patient] yeah for the most part[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [Patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [Patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [Patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [Patient] yeah[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [Patient] probably about a month ago[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [Patient] no not really[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like

admitted to district regional hospital on 06\/29\/2021 , and was discharged on 07\/02\/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to , uh , prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ? [Patient] not too bad . and yourself ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ? [Patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on . [Patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high . [Patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] typically , it does n't . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive . [Patient] yeah , that's what they said .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ... [Patient] hm .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] uh , they did n't do a ct scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ? [Patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in . [Patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , maybe that's all it was . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ? [Patient] yes , i am .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] great . so here are my thoughts . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ? [Patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ? [Patient] sure , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see . [Patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing . [Patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ? [Patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ? [Patient] i am unvaccinated .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ? [Patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] correct , we do n't . [Patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as \" vaccine injury \" .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] right . [Patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that . [Patient] all of them ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ? [Patient] no , i do n't .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint . [Patient] well , i am open-minded to this .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP]","346":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] and good morning hi beverly [Patient] good morning[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] how do you see your last name [Patient] howard[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] howard nice to meet you [Patient] you too[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] what can i do for you today [Patient] well i think i like fell off of my tandem bike with my partner and my knee has been hurting ever since[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and when did that happen [Patient] maybe like two weeks ago[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and which knee are we talking about [Patient] my right knee[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] alright and tell me exactly what happened [Patient] so we were like riding together and i think he said he saw a squirrel or something like that he's a little distractible and you know like he went down so i went down i hit it on the curb like it's really kinda it was sore i gave i i took some ibuprofen and i i like washed it out and put a band-aid on it but it's it's just been like kind of hurting everyday since then so i scheduled an appointment[SEP]","347":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] all right , new patient , jordan roberts . date of birth : 3\/2\/1972 . he's a 49 year old , uh hm , with hypertension and palpitations . please copy forward his thyroid profile from march 1st , 2021 . hello mr. roberts , how are you doing today ?

you also have a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes we want to take a look at those as well so first thing what's going on with your kidneys you as what how long ago have you been feeling pain and and how's all that [Patient] pain's been up and down i went to the emergency room last week but now i think i'm doing a little bit better[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so the case of kidney stones so have you had you said you've had them in the past and how often would you say [Patient] i do n't know i this is probably like my seventh or eighth kidney stone[SEP][Personal

one in a while but yes i saw someone maybe a year ago[SEP][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay so yeah i know you keep having these recurrent kidney stones so i definitely think we can get you a referral to urology just to check up on that and also wan na do some labs as well [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so i also see you're here for you have a past medical history of of hypertension and when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was a one fifty over ninety i'm reading here in your chart you're on two point five of norvasc [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] now have you been taking that regularly [Patient] i have but at home my blood pressure is always great[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay maybe you have a little white coat syndrome some of my patients do have it i have it myself and i'm a provider so i definitely understand yeah i know we we talked about last time you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking those about two to three times a week so what have those readings been i'm usually like one thirty to one forty over sixty to seventy [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] that's that's that's not too bad i think when you first came in you were around like one eighty so it seems to be that that norvasc is is working for you how about your diet i know you were having a little issue eating some fast food and and cakes and cookies and have you been able to get that under control [Patient] yeah it's hard to give up the fast food altogether because it's a lot of on the go you know[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay so do you think you would be able to get that under control by yourself or would you do you think you would need help

or less of sodium per day i know that's hard for a lot of salads and stuff i know it's hard for lot of people especially with all like the the prepackage foods we have around today so that's definitely something we we should work on [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so let's also look here you have a history of diabetes and so you're on that five hundred

[Patient] i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ? [Patient] yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ? [Patient] well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ? [Patient] about five to six years ago .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ? [Patient] no . they said they'd see me in 10 years .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well that's good news . [Patient] yeah , i agree .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] all right . do you ever drink alcohol ? [Patient] yeah , but only once or twice a year .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ? [Patient] i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] all right . and what are you taking ? [Patient] i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ? [Patient] yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . anything else ? [Patient] yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on . [Patient] sounds good . thank you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding . [Patient] is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why . [Patient] lovely .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Medication][Doctor] we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","351":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , albert . how are you ?

going on for a while i like to run i do jogs i sign up for the 5k tack you know sometimes the marathon and i have n't been doing longer distances because [Patient] when i'm running i my right knee here it just starts to ache and it's it's just to the point where i need your opinion[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay okay what have you done for it so far what makes it better what makes it worse [Patient] well it used to be that when i run it ache and then i put ice on it and then it would be okay so i do ice and ibuprofen[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay okay and did you see anybody for this before coming into the office here [Patient] yeah i doctor wood is my primary care provider and i talked to him about it actually over the years and this last visit he said he referred me to you[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay okay good so ice and rest makes it feel better running and and activity makes it hurt a little bit more is that correct [Patient] yeah that's right[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay do you have any family history of arthritis or any of those type of immune diseases [Patient] i'm trying to think no i do n't think so no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and do you get is it is this primarily worse in the morning or does it is it just there all the time when it comes on [Patient] it actually is worse towards the end of the day[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so let's go ahead and i want to do a quick examination here your blood pressure and was one twenty over sixty that's phenomenal your heart rate was fifty eight and you can tell that you're a runner with that that level of a heart rate and your respirations were fourteen so all of that looked very good there was no fever when you came in when i'm gon na just quickly listen to your heart and lungs okay those those sound good but let me get let's focus here on your lower extremities i'm i'm gon na look at your your left knee first when i move your left knee do you get any type of pain or is it just feel like normal and it's always your pain's always isolated to the right [Patient] that feels that feels normal[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay okay so let me i just want you to back up here in the stretcher a little bit more and i'm just gon na do some movement of your knee any okay so i want you to push your leg out against my hand does that hurt [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay and if you pull back does that hurt a little bit [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay and i'm gon na move it around so when i look at the knee there is no redness there's no swelling i can appreciate a a small amount of effusion and that means that there's a little bit of fluid under the knee or in that knee's joint space and there is there is several reasons that could be now when i push on your knee does it hurt more on the inside or does it hurt more on the outside here [Patient] the the right knee here hurts on the outside[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay okay and you've got a good pedal pulse so you know you can feel that and when i touch your feet you do n't have any numbness or tingling or anything like that [Patient] no uh uh[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Medication][Radiology Examination][Referral][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay well so what i want to tell you is that i think you have a knee sprain from overuse and we see that sometimes in runners now unfortunately you're gon na have to take some a little bit of time off of of active running but i do n't think it will be that long until we can get you up and running again now i reviewed the x-rays that we did when you first came into the office here this morning and the joint spaces of that right knee are are well maintained i do n't see any evidence of any fracture and when compared to the left knee everything looks good so i do n't even see any signs of any arthritis that i would've been suspecting i would like you to stay on two tylenol five hundred milligrams and two ibuprofen two hundred milligram tablets and i want you to take that three times a day and that's gon na help with both the pain and the inflammation i'm also gon na order some physical therapy for your your right knee and that physical therapy will help strengthen the lower extremities and make it give you a little bit of a balance and some they'll be able to recommend good running exercises for you i do wan na follow up with you in two weeks and see if we're getting better so let's no running for two weeks and if we're we're improving then we'll move on and probably start adding some additional activity does that sound like a plan [Patient] yeah that does i i was curious so i will lay off the running for now can i you know lift weights and do like my squats and and those type of exercises at the gym[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Doctor] yeah absolutely and and those are good exercises but i'd like you to get that first physical therapy appointment in and they'll be able to talk with you on what the best exercises are for you to do [Patient] okay got it[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] any questions [Patient] hmmm no i do n't think

really surprised because i've been feeling fine[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so were you ever told in the past that you have hepatitis c [Patient] no never[SEP][Other Socials][Drug History][Doctor] okay and do do you have any history like iv drug use known that you know or do you have any known to have any like hepatitis c positive partners [Patient] i mean like years ago i used to party a lot and even use iv drugs but i've been clean for over fifteen years now[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay well very good you know congratulations on that that's that's a great great achievement so tell me though how about alcohol use [Patient] i used to drink a lot a lot more alcohol now i probably would say i drink about a beer a day[SEP]","356":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate . hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ? [Patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now . [Patient] yes . it's doing much better .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ? [Patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , that sounds good . [Patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ? [Patient] no , i'm not right now .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication . [Patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel . [Patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . [Patient] okay . i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? [Patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ? [Patient] twice a day .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ? [Patient] no , that's fine .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] how often are you using that one ? [Patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ? [Patient] i'm not .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ? [Patient] no wipes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ? [Patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ? [Patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk . [Patient] it is ? okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself . [Patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that . [Patient] yes , i did . thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it . [Patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] let's see . [Patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much . [Patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 . [Patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form . [Patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , mm-hmm . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else . [Patient] can you do the metro market ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find . [Patient] sure .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say . [Patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] correct , it's not a steroid . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin . [Patient] all right .[SEP]","357":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate . hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ? [Patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now . [Patient] yes . it's doing much better .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ? [Patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , that sounds good . [Patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ? [Patient] no , i'm not right now .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication . [Patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel . [Patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . [Patient] okay . i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? [Patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ? [Patient] twice a day .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ? [Patient] no , that's fine .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] how often are you using that one ? [Patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ? [Patient] i'm not .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ? [Patient] no wipes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ? [Patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ? [Patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .

[Patient] mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ? [Patient] yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] congratulations . that's great . and then , um- [Patient] thank you .[SEP][Other Socials][Drug History][Doctor] . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ? [Patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast . [Patient] okay . that's fine .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well . [Patient] right .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery . [Patient] okay . well , thank you for explaining that .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line . [Patient] okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .[SEP]","364":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] so stephanie morales is a 36 -year-old female today complaining of her ankle pain and she also has a history of diabetes and high blood pressure so stephanie tell me what's going on with your ankle [Patient] well we had a long spring and the other day

how are you [Patient] i'm doing okay i as you're aware doctor miller sent me over for this pain in my belly that i've had for several weeks they did he did an ultrasound and and said i had gallstones and they recommended i stay several way from some high fat food but i'm just still having a lot of pain and he referred me to you[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright well i'm i'm sorry to hear that you're having pain but i i'm glad that he sent you over to see me i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain can you describe the kind of pain that you feel [Patient] well it's it's on the right hand side of my belly it's it's right underneath my ribs and it feels like a a squeezing severe pain it comes and goes but when it comes it's really severe and i get kind of nauseated and sick in my stomach[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then when you get that pain can you rate that pain for me on a scale like zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life [Patient] when it's severe it's it's probably an eight[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright and then time wise are we looking at can it just come and go anytime or is it specifically around mealtimes how how does that pain kinda wax and wane for you [Patient] most of the time it comes right after i eat[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] do n't weigh all so speaking of eating let's talk a little bit about your diet i see here on your chart that you're a type two diabetic and it looked like that you were gon na handle that with diet and exercise let's talk about that a little bit [Patient] well you know i my my diet was worse when i before i was diagnosed with the the type two diabetes[SEP][Personal History][Other Socials][Doctor] okay so other than the weight loss how how is your diet is that has that been working out for you i mean do you does does that does that fit your lifestyle pretty well [Patient] yeah it does it does it it i was surprised it was n't as hard as i thought to go back and cut back and go more of a keto diet[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah and that can happen and one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods which is you know kind of the the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food and has that been difficult since you are watching your carb intake [Patient] the fatty food it is a little bit difficult you know i like those pork grinds and you know i i've had to kind of cut those out they were a nice staple for me when i was on the keto diet but i have cut out the those pork rinses because those were just so delicious and you know i would say it's a little bit better but i still get that pain[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay and then do you have any family history of gallbladder disease [Patient] yeah but you know you know i knew that was coming both my dad and my mother both had gallbladder disease and had to have their gallbladders off[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay so both both your parents your mom and your dad had your had their gallbladders taken out [Patient] yeah[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay and then i wan na talk a little bit about your activity level and your and and if you're exercising has this affected your ability to to get out and exercise [Patient] not really i mean i usually i got ta watch it around meals you know but i've never been a big exerciser right after eating anyhow but you know i'm i'm so glad springs here because it gives me that opportunity to get back out and you know i love photography i i love nature of photography and with the with the the woods going from you know that dark barron look to coming alive with that green and and butting i i love to get out and take foot photographs there[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] that's awesome to hear yeah i my wife and i like to go over and take nature hikes through the new park behind the rex center that just opened up have you ever been over there to do any any picture taken we've got a bunch of beautiful nature pictures that we took about a week ago [Patient] no i have n't been there i might have to try that out yeah[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah it's awesome [Patient] i like to get down near the river that's where i i like to catch especially around spring time[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] that's great yeah next time you come in maybe you can bring in some of your pictures that'd be awesome to see [Patient] okay cool[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] so i'm just curious talking about your symptoms here have you had any fevers you mentioned something about nausea but have you actually vomited from those symptoms [Patient] there's times when the pain is really bad for a couple of days i've had some what i i would describe as low grade fevers and yes you're right i have feel nauseated but i have n't thrown up[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure was one twenty eight over eighty eight respiratory rate was sixteen your pulse rate was sixty eight you were afebrile today which is a good thing and your oxygen saturation on room air was ninety nine percent taking a listen to your heart here your heart is regular of rate and rhythm no i do n't hear any ectopic beats no clicks rubs or murmurs noted listening to your lungs here they are clear and equal bilaterally to auscultation now i'm gon na go ahead and do an an abdominal exam i do note positive bowel sounds soft nondistended abdomen however you are positive for some slight guarding there to the right upper quadrant but i do n't note any rebound tenderness now i'm gon na press slightly here beneath your ribs on the right hand side now take a breath in does that hurt when i press so i i see that you're guarded there so i'm gon na say that that it did hurt when i it did hurt when i [Patient] absolutely that hurts so much when you push right there[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Other Treatments][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay that's that's no problem so you are positive for murphy's signs but i do n't appreciate any peritoneal signs so let's talk a little bit about your results that i reviewed before you came in today so your abdominal ultrasound shows multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder and i do appreciate some mild thickening now the common bile duct size is within normal limits at four . one millimeters now let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you okay i do believe you have some mild cholecystitis with gallstones i do n't appreciate any frank obstruction but it looks like your gallbladder is inflamed and it looks like that's happened maybe over the last few weeks since you've been having those symptoms now since you have n't had any improvement with dietary modifications i am going to make the recommendation that we do remove your gallbladder and i would like to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy now what that means is i'll make a few small incisions and insert a scope with some of those instruments that's gon na remove that gallbladder through one of those little bitty incisions now the surgery is gon na take about an hour to an hour and a half and you'll probably spend the night in the hospital because we just wan na monitor you post procedure to make sure everything is okay you're still gon na wan na avoid those high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are gon na be high in fiber now do you have any questions about what our assessment and plan is for for this [Patient] no no questions today[SEP]","366":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] hey mason good to see you today so

around you [Patient] sick all the time everybody is sick these days[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] alright [Patient] so[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] but what about at home how about your siblings are any of them sick [Patient] most of them are healthy yeah most of them are healthy although you know i have a brother who smokes i have told him not to smoke he does n't listen[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] house told not to smoke at the house but you know anyway[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct [Patient] yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay [Patient] sure[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain [Patient] no[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerular nephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment [Patient] how much are all these tests going to cost[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them [Patient] okay that's that's good to know[SEP]","368":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] and good morning hi beverly [Patient] good

drawer anterior drawer negative lachman negative good let's go ahead and just kinda bend and straighten for me [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good patellar patella tracks fine no crepitus alright let's go back to this medial side you're tender right there is that right [Patient] yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Physical Examination][Doctor] it's tender on the medial joint line but actually negative mcmurray negative lateral side negative mcmurray good so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts [Patient] yeah sometimes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like [Patient] walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] you actually no [Patient] yeah it hurts no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] what about you i mean are you real weak [Patient] no i would say i'm pretty strong[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] did you go to the gym [Patient] i go to the gym but i swim so the[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay i ca n't treat people like you you you you need to work harder [Patient] i quit complaining okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yes sir work harder [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] do you do you play sports in in college or high school [Patient] i did in high school[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids [Patient] no[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] just kinda you're thinking walking the dog [Patient] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee [Patient] no no i have n't would you recommend that[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it's pretty bad [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] we'll get we'll get to that too [Patient] okay[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today [Patient] yes[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay do i go into that to [Patient] yeah[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it [Patient] you're only cup of this[SEP][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Other Treatments][Doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Other Treatments][Doctor] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] does that make sense [Patient] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary [Patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this [Patient] okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right [Patient] okay alright i think that sounds good[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] did you get did you select you last night [Patient] i did[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] you yeah what do you think what do you roof for [Patient] i so i i'm a little heart broken right now i was for the rockets and the way that these nets are crushing them it's just it's just painful[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] are you

while i like to run i do jogs i sign up for the 5k tack you know sometimes the marathon and i have n't been doing longer distances because [Patient] when i'm running i my right knee here it just starts to ache and it's it's just to the point where i need your opinion[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay okay what have you done for it so far what makes it better what makes it worse [Patient] well it used to be that when i run it ache and then i put ice on it and then it would be okay so i do ice and ibuprofen[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay okay and did you see anybody for this before coming into the office here [Patient] yeah i doctor wood is my primary care provider and i talked to him about it actually over the years and this last visit he said he referred me to you[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay okay good so ice and rest makes it feel better running and and activity makes it hurt a little bit more is that correct [Patient] yeah that's right[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay do you have any family history of arthritis or any of those type of immune diseases [Patient] i'm trying to think no i do n't think so no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and do you get is it is this primarily worse in the morning or does it is it just there all the time when it comes on [Patient] it actually is worse towards the end of the day[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so let's go ahead and i want to do a quick examination here your blood pressure and was one twenty over sixty that's phenomenal your heart rate was fifty eight and you can tell that you're a runner with that that level of a heart rate and your respirations were fourteen so all of that looked very good there was no fever when you came in when i'm gon na just quickly listen to your heart and lungs okay those those sound good but let me get let's focus here on your lower extremities i'm i'm gon na look at your your left knee first when i move your left knee do you get any type of pain or is it just feel like normal and it's always your pain's always isolated to the right [Patient] that feels that feels normal[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay okay so let me i just want you to back up here in the stretcher a little bit more and i'm just gon na do some movement of your knee any okay so i want you to push your leg out against my hand does that hurt [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay and if you pull back does that hurt a little bit [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay and i'm gon na move it around so when i look at the knee there is no redness there's no swelling i can appreciate a a small amount of effusion and that means that there's a little bit of fluid under the knee or in that knee's joint space and there is there is several reasons that could be now when i push on your knee does it hurt more on the inside or does it hurt more on the outside here [Patient] the the right knee here hurts on the outside[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay okay and you've got a good pedal pulse so you know you can feel that and when i touch your feet you do n't have any numbness or tingling or anything like that [Patient] no uh uh[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Medication][Radiology Examination][Referral][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay well so what i want to tell you is that i think you have a knee sprain from overuse and we see that sometimes in runners now unfortunately you're gon na have to take some a little bit of time off of of active running but i do n't think it will be that long until we can get you up and running again now i reviewed the x-rays that we did when you first came into the office here this morning and the joint spaces of that right knee are are well maintained i do n't see any evidence of any fracture and when compared to the left knee everything looks good so i do n't even see any signs of any arthritis that i would've been suspecting i would like you to stay on two tylenol five hundred milligrams and two ibuprofen two hundred milligram tablets and i want you to take that three times a day and that's gon na help with both the pain and the inflammation i'm also gon na order some physical therapy for your your right knee and that physical therapy will help strengthen the lower extremities and make it give you a little bit of a balance and some they'll be able to recommend good running exercises for you i do wan na follow up with you in two weeks and see if we're getting better so let's no running for two weeks and if we're we're improving then we'll move on and probably start adding some additional activity does that sound like a plan [Patient] yeah that does i i was curious so i will lay off the running for now can i you know lift weights and do like my squats and and those type of exercises at the gym[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Doctor] yeah absolutely and and those are good exercises but i'd like you to get that first physical therapy appointment in and they'll be able to talk with you on what the best exercises are for you to do [Patient] okay got it[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] any questions [Patient] hmmm no i do n't think

so he is always upset so so anyway[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked [Patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing [Patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all [Patient] no just the swelling and the pain[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain [Patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and [Patient] putting a cold pack on it[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and has that helped at all [Patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here [Patient] i had my tonsils out[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press [Patient] yeah that's sore[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt [Patient] yeah do n't do that anymore[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Referral][Medication][Doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that [Patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan[SEP][Reassessment][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Medication][Doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions [Patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me[SEP]","378":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is

guess i can blame them but but yeah it's been a it's been an issue with the family for as long as i've been aware of[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright and i'm reading here it looks like you've had them before as well right [Patient] i have yeah i passed some by myself and i've had to have surgery a couple of times as well[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so the ones that you passed by yourself how many days would you say it would take to to pass [Patient] usually within within a week i manage to to get them out[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay alright so you got anything fun plan for the weekend [Patient] just getting this pain under control[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay well that that sounds like a good plan we can definitely help you out with that alright so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated and i think that's probably because you're in pain and that's understandable everything else looks fine so on pressing on your abdomen does that hurt [Patient] no no no pain[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in [Patient] yeah it's a little tender yeah it's little tender[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Radiology Examination][Reassessment][Doctor] okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of high flow nephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you [Patient] so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer [Patient] they did they did yeah and i've been i've been using that but so far nothing[SEP]","382":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] alright julia so you've been coming to see me for a while now ever since you had an rca stent placed back in twenty

Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and what seemed to bring it on anything exacerbated or relieve it [Patient] it mainly happens when i'm walking i like to try and walk but lately i just have n't been able to keep up with it because i'm having this pain[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright and well how would you describe this pain it's like a dull pain sharp pain stabbing pain how would you describe it [Patient] i would say it's dull it's kinda like a pressure[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and does it go anywhere or radiate any place [Patient] no[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright but no chest pain right now no shortness of breath no sweats or clamminess or anything like that right now [Patient] nothing right now[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay alright well certainly you know i looked at your ekg that did we did in the office when you came in the ekg i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so i'm you know we should definitely talk about the plan for this chest pain in a few minutes but right now the good news is i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so let's talk a little bit about your other conditions since you are here today how are you doing with your diabetes i know we have you on metformin and we talked about last time about you know improving your diet and exercise i'm glad you're exercising but i'm so sorry to hear about the chest pain so tell me about how is that going [Patient] yeah i mean i think my blood sugars have been a little higher because i have n't been able to be active and i'm trying with the diet you know i do love sodas so i'm really trying strength dose[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah i i am addicted to diet coke myself so i i hear you on that one and we had checked your hemoglobin a1c last time it was you know seven . which is pretty good it's not you know it could be better but it's not it's not bad and we talked about sending you to ophthalmology also for an eye exam have you seen ophthalmology in the last few months or last before i saw you [Patient] i have an appointment in two weeks it was a long waiting[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay got it and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that with your diabetes or any side effects from your medications the metformin [Patient] no[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright good and i saw also there was a record in your i was looking at your record before previously before i walked in you also had we've been checking your blood pressure but but i think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure have you noticed any findings with that or have you know have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that because we do n't have it in our system here yet but i did add it in today but we do n't have you on any medications yet for that [Patient] no i mean i do n't know doc no one told me about high blood pressure do i have high blood pressure[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well i think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the your blood pressure was elevated so they had mentioned that i noticed a trend in your blood pressure it's been running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years [Patient] okay do you think that could be causing me my my chest pain[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so [Patient] someone had told me before[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah me too but we we can we can definitely you know get you started on some monitoring devices for that and also maybe start you on some some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure and maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay [Patient] okay sounds good[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Referral][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness so what does all this mean i'll explain that in a second so basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs so you know with this chest pain i'm a little bit so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily i'm also gon na give you a prescription just a baby aspirin you can take eighty one milligrams once a day and also i'm gon na give you a prescription for nitroglycerin it's a it's a little pill you split underneath your tongue if you have this chest pain if it does n't go away after one or two pills i want you to go to the hospital call nine one one and go to the hospital but we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart okay any questions about that [Patient] so anytime i have a chest pain even if i'm just like walking i have to take that pill[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah if you if you stop walking the chest pain goes away you do n't have to take the pill but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away i would take the pill and see if it goes away if it does not [Patient] how long like how long do i wait to see if it goes away[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes and if it does n't go away then i would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because i worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it does n't lead to a heart attack those chest pain could be a you know a a a sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] alright [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Medication][Other Treatments][Reassessment][Doctor] and for the second problem the diabetes you know i think you're doing fairly well continue with your eye ophthalmology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today and i'm gon na have you come back in about two weeks and we can see if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away from you know the the pop and the sweet things and once we have your heart taken care of or make sure your heart is okay you can and we can hopefully resolve this chest pain that you're having get back to your exercise regimen okay any questions about that [Patient] no[SEP][Medication][Reassessment][Doctor] okay and for the third diagnosis the high blood pressure you you do have a trend i've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure's been running a little bit high several other people have documented as well i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide it's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus it'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your in your feet i'm gon na have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at epic mychart and i'll get a reading of those as well and then what when you come back in two weeks we'll keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going and then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling i think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is a probably a good idea [Patient] okay are there any side effects with this medication[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah it can cause sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom a little bit more often in the evening but generally most people do n't have a whole lot of side effects i'll give you a handout of the side effects but sometimes you can have a cross reaction with some other medications like sulfa medications but generally most people tolerate this pretty well [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] alright any other questions we got [Patient] that's it[SEP]","418":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hi , bryan . how are you ?

hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation . hi emily , how are you ? [Patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ? [Patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's the 250\/50 dose , correct ? [Patient] yes , correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ? [Patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ? [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ? [Patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ? [Patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no kidding , that's great . [Patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] really ? [Patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ? [Patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ? [Patient] probably about three or four .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ?

[Patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ? [Patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ? [Patient] mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ? [Patient] yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] congratulations . that's great . and then , um- [Patient] thank you .[SEP][Other Socials][Drug History][Doctor] . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ? [Patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast . [Patient] okay . that's fine .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well . [Patient] right .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery . [Patient] okay . well , thank you for explaining that .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line . [Patient] okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility . [Patient] okay , yeah , that sounds good .[SEP]","424":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey brandon you know glad to see you in here today i see on your chart that you're

[Patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ? [Patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's the 250\/50 dose , correct ? [Patient] yes , correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ? [Patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ? [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ? [Patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ? [Patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no kidding , that's great . [Patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] really ? [Patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ? [Patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ? [Patient] probably about three or four .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ? [Patient] yes , that's correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ? [Patient] i do .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then . [Patient] nope .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ? [Patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ? [Patient] correct .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ? [Patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ? [Patient] yeah , that's right .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ? [Patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ? [Patient] yeah , it does , it works great .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ? [Patient] yep , that's correct .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ? [Patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it . [Patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ? [Patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment . [Patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point . [Patient] all right , that sounds good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh . [Patient] ahh .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good . [Patient] awesome .[SEP]","428":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] hey steven so i see that you're here and you've been experiencing some back pain for a while could you tell me

was drinking too[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay okay you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past like what were they [Patient] so i i had a doc gave me some injections before i'm not sure what they were though[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright and i see in your chart here that you had physical therapy did you feel that that was effective [Patient] no i feel like i could do them the same exercises at my house like they charged me and like it[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay but did the did the exercises help [Patient] i mean i guess a little[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay not a so not as effective as we would have liked did they put you on any pain medications [Patient] yeah it was just a white pill i'm not sure what it was[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay do n't worry i think i can look that up in your chart i just wan na make sure that we have the story straight alright so i know that you said that you mentioned that you played basketball you know before how how like what's your activity like now [Patient] i mean i sit at home all day[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay that's a pretty okay that's a pretty significant weight gain well i i just have a few more questions have you do you know if any of your family members have spine conditions [Patient] i think my fourth cousin has scoliosis[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay okay but that's that's a little distant but anybody direct like sister brother mom dad [Patient] i do n't think so i mean i do n't even my dad though[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay okay and then do you have a personal history of smoking [Patient] what type of smoking[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] any smoke you do n't have to tell me exactly but [Patient] okay[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] have you smoked [Patient] next maybe that i have n't[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] are you it's okay i'm your doctor i'm not here to judge you i just want to make sure that i'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you i need to know this information so one more time do you smoke or have you smoked before [Patient] okay i smoked[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it [Patient] i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay you have [Patient] too many questions are you the fit[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm your doctor i have to [Patient] are you the fence you sound like the fence next question[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Drug History][Doctor] okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things [Patient] sent them off yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] pardon [Patient] because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen[SEP][Physical Examination][Drug History][Doctor] you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt [Patient] yeah it hurts[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay and when you bend backward does it hurt [Patient] a little bit[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up [Patient] stop[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the [Patient] what does that mean like am i dying[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay [Patient] that's a big word[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Acute Assessment][Doctor] those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something [Patient] i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection [Patient] okay[SEP]","429":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] good morning julie how are you doing this morning [Patient] i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you because of this this

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] hey , dragon . order meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day . and then i'd like to um , just see those- how- the x-ray show- shows up and the results of that before we refer you for any type of physical therapy , okay ?

[Patient] twenty years ago i broke my ankle i had to put in a cast but that seems to be okay but you know sometimes it'll give me trouble once in a while it feels a little sore it swells up at times[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright so when you dropped that brick on your foot were you able to get up and keep working or did you have to get off your you know not stop weightbearing and and get off that foot can you tell me a little bit about after the traumatic incident [Patient] i you know it was a little sore i called a few names you know god damn why is this in my foot but you know i kept working putting it around a little bit but now it's got swollen so i got to see my doctor he told me i had to go see you here i am so tell me what's going on with it[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so what have you been doing for the pain since the initial insult [Patient] lucken it up[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you taken any medications safe for example tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain [Patient] no i feel like taking the medicine[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay and then just out of curiosity you said you were doing some landscaping have you been over to landscapes warehouse new here in town my wife and i were just over there this last weekend and picked up a whole bunch of stuff you had a chance to make it over there yet [Patient] no not yet i heard about it though i might have to make a trip once my foot heals[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright that sounds good now just out of curiosity can you rate your pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life [Patient] eleven out of ten[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numbness or tingling of that foot since the incident [Patient] yeah the whole foot is numb[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Follow-up][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay i'm gon na do a quick physical exam now your vitals look good and i would like to do a focused exam of your right foot the there is some bruising on the bottom part of your foot and on the top part as well and i do appreciate the associated swelling and i also recognize that you do have tenderness to palpation for midfoot now for your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is brisk in less than three seconds i do note a strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse with motor and sensation is intact for that foot i also like to call out the fact that it matches bilaterally which is important i'm gon na go ahead and review the diagnostic imaging results so we did a x-ray of that right foot and i do notice dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to your second metatarsal bone and the top of your foot this is where the metatarsals meet those cuboids okay so it where the bones come together in your foot now there are a lot of ligaments in your foot so i do want to order an mri just to assess if there is any injuries to those ligaments now based on your exam and looking at the x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery now the reason why this is important is if we have poor bone alignment or ligament healing you can this can lead to losing the arch in your foot you could becoming flat-footed and also developing arthritis now what's gon na be key here is the surgery is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly we are going to put them back into place using plates and screws now the key thing is going to be it's going to be outpatient surgery so it's going to be same day i'll see you in the morning and then you'll be discharged home that evening and we will do a follow-up i wan na see you in twenty four hours post procedure but then i'll see you again in two weeks you're gon na be in a cast and i'm gon na have you use crutches you're not gon na be able to weight-bear on that foot for six to eight weeks what we'll do is we'll advance your ambulating gradually based on how you heal and based on how you tolerate the procedure i know i have covered a lot of material quickly but this is really gon na be the best course of action for you to have a good outcome now do you have any questions come answers concerns before i have the nurse come in finish the paperwork and get you set up for your procedure which we are going to do tomorrow if you're agreeable to that [Patient] what about putting in a cast can i just stay in the cast[SEP]","439":"[Conversation Start][Acute

[Patient] i'm trying to back off of it . i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure . [Patient] sounds good .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] are you doing any exercise ? [Patient] i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great . [Patient] good to hear .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts . [Patient] nope . nowhere .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ? [Patient] uh , no .[SEP][Discussion][Reassessment][Doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone . [Patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try . [Patient] all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room . [Patient] all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay . [Patient] all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon . [Patient] i'll definitely let you know if that happens .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better . um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged . um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure . [Patient] i understand .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise . um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure . [Patient] really ? i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah , yeah . it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium . um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that . um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information . um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff . [Patient] okay . i'll definitely check that out .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Referral][Medication][Doctor] all right . so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes . uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] all right . so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension . they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up . when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure . [Patient] that's interesting .[SEP]","452":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey anna good to see you today so i'm looking here in my notes says you have you're coming in today for some right ankle pain after a fall so can you tell me what happened how did you fall [Patient] yeah so i was taking out the trash last night and i ended up slipping on a patch of ice like and then when i fell i heard this pop and it just hurts[SEP]","453":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] well good morning emily how are you [Patient] good morning[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] how are you doing [Patient] doing okay i'm okay[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] i understand you're having some sudden visual distortions and some blurring of your vision is that right [Patient] it is yes[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay so what's going on [Patient] sorry to put you off i do n't think i have that script[SEP]","454":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] next patient is melissa sanchez . date of birth , 9\/23\/1962 . mrn : 5484367 . she is being seen in office today for status post mitral valve repair done on 8\/3\/2020 . at her previous follow-up on 9\/17 , we felt that she was doing quite well from a cardiac standpoint , and so we recommended she continue with the same medication . ecg taken on 12\/26\/2020 reveals atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response . t-wave inversion anteriorly . compared to the previous study , there are no significant changes , and please add in the history , patient has a history of mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation , history of diabetes , asthma , and recurrent chest discomfort with negative cardiac workup for coronary artery disease . ms. sanchez , it's good to see you again .

yeah you know i started noticing my wife and i we we eat out almost every night and it's when especially when we go to fancy place[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] i have trouble adjusting in the that dark dim environment[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and i reviewed my technician's notes before i came in to see you and it says you know you you've been having that decreased vision when you're reading especially in dark place like you just said but it also mentions here that it looks like you told her that when you look at straight lines like in your door frame it looks like things have been looking a little crooked to you how long has that been going on [Patient] well you know it's been going on a little while probably getting worse over the last three to four months and you know my my office has paneling and you know how that paneling has that dark grooves in it those straight lines well they always look wavy to me[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay alright so it's been going on a few months now you mentioned that you and your wife go out to eat every night have you tried the new the new italium place over there on main street [Patient] my gosh yes we were just there the other night down in the it's down in the basement of that big building yeah we went there the other night and i got ta tell you it was like the saprano family was sitting across from us there was this bunch of old guys that had bottles of of red wine all over the table and they were my gosh it was so good and the food i mean i mean i ca n't tell you how great the food was[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it was amazing my wife and i went over there the other day and when we walked downstairs it was like i was walking into a scene out of saprano's [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] but the food was amazing it was the best egg plant parmer's john i've i've ever had where really super excited about going back there here very very soon [Patient] yeah i had the bio marsal and it was my gosh it was to die for[SEP][Drug History][Drug History][Doctor] i'll have to get that next time i go so in reviewing your paperwork here it looks like you made mention that you smoke are you still smoking about a pack a day [Patient] yeah i i tried i've tried i've done hypnosis i've done lozenges i've done chewing gum and i get real close but you know i'll just go out one evening without the wife and and the next thing i know i'm i'm you know buying a cigarette off of somebody and it's it's really hard for me to get that stopped[SEP][Therapeutic History][Drug History][Doctor] yeah i i appreciate that but it's really gon na be important that you try to to either cut back or quit smoking altogether now that leads me into my next concern here it looks like you have a history of high blood pressure and i'm just wondering are you are you taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and and are you checking your blood pressures on a regular basis [Patient] i'm glad you just mentioned that because i have n't taken my blood pressure pill for a while it's up in the cupboard and it's back in that corner and i just i ca n't forget to take it[SEP][Therapeutic History][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay it's really gon na be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed i'd really like to see you start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and and let's set that that pill bottle down on the counter and see if that does n't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam on your eyes i'm gon na go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me [Patient] okay that's a bright light[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Medication][Doctor] yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection [Patient] have you ever somebody stick a needle in your eye[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah literally yeah [Patient] yeah[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] the good news is injection given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it however i also have to let you know that there could be a situation where you may still note a small amount of vision loss but this is your best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as you can so i know i have given you a lot of information i wan na pause here and see if you have any questions comments or concerns before we get you scheduled for that injection [Patient] no i'm i mean as as long as you think it wo n't hurt a lot that will be good[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay i think it's gon na be our best plan to help slow this disease process [Patient] okay[SEP][Medication][Doctor] alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and we're gon na go ahead and do the first injection today [Patient] okay okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] sounds good i'll be back in a couple of minutes [Patient] okay thank you very much[SEP]","459":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] um , hi mrs. anderson . right ?

you're coming in you you have i think you have a kidney stone so can you tell me what's going on how are you feeling and you're my my patient [Patient] and i'm your patient yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so is it is it a constant pain or does it come and go for you [Patient] it comes and goes it depends on how much i've been drinking and you know what sort of activities i've been doing but it's still there[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] alright so have you noticed any pain when you've been urinating [Patient] not really[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay have you noticed any blood in your urine [Patient] no blood i did have an episode where the pain radiated to one of my testicles which was kinda weird but but yeah it it sort of calmed down a little bit in that regards[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain [Patient] yeah i've been taking some ibuprofen and that kinda like calms it down a little bit but it persists[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and what would you say like your pain score is out of ten [Patient] it's probably a four out of ten when it gets a little more out of control for the most part it's probably in the order of one or two out of ten[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so it is it's it's it's not too bad [Patient] it's a new ones yeah but i know it's there it does n't go away[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay yeah yeah a lot of my patients you know have that that minor pain so you [Patient] i'm a horrible active by the way[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] no yeah that's that's that's totally fine that's totally fine you know i'm just playing the doctor on tv so good good alright so have you had any other symptoms nausea vomiting anything like that [Patient] no nausea no vomiting i had some i felt like it might have been like chills but no fevers nothing along those lines[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay that's good do you know anybody in your family that has had kidney stones in the past [Patient] yeah all in my family has had kidney stones in the past[SEP][Family History][Doctor] no well they did n't set you up good did they [Patient] yeah i i i guess i can blame them but but yeah it's been a it's been an issue with the family for as long as i've been aware of[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright and i'm reading here it looks like you've had them before as well right [Patient] i have yeah i passed some by myself and i've had to have surgery a couple of times as well[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so the ones that you passed by yourself how many days would you say it would take to to pass [Patient] usually within within a week i manage to to get them out[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay alright so you got anything fun plan for the weekend [Patient] just getting this pain under control[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay well that that sounds like a good plan we can definitely help you out with that alright so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated and i think that's probably because you're in pain and that's understandable everything else looks fine so on pressing on your abdomen does that hurt [Patient] no no no pain[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in [Patient] yeah it's a little tender yeah it's little tender[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Radiology Examination][Reassessment][Doctor] okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of high flow nephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you [Patient] so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer [Patient] they did they did yeah and i've been i've been using that but so far nothing[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate so hopefully we can catch the stone i'm also gon na order a bmp a urinalysis and urine culture and based on what that shows we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics i do n't think you have an infection but you know there is that possibility and then i want to see you again in one to two weeks if you are still having symptoms and if you know you still have the stone with you we can talk about further treatment possible lithotripsy you know that's the shockwave treatment i'm pretty sure you've had that prior to [Patient] yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i want[SEP]","461":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , john , how are you doing ?

[Patient] i did when i came in last time when i saw your pa , ruth sanchez in march . she said i , she said she found a lump right here under my left breast , but i have n't felt it since then . but i did the massages .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , well . that that's good . uh , it's probably just the scar tissue , but everything looks good and you're healing wonderful , so .

[Patient] yeah , but this one just bothered me a little bit more .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] i understand . um , you can close your gown now . the only thing that is really going to help out that is to uh , to cut it out and re-close it .

[Patient] i mean , not right now .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] um , you want to come back and revisit um , maybe six months ? [Patient] yeah , i will do that . i still have n't , i still have some more of the gel and i can try using that again .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . keep doing that twice a day . the gel is going to lighten the color a little bit , which is already pretty light . um , but , just in that area , and it's high tension , so it's going to rub a little bit . [Patient] yeah , but it kind of bothers me a little bit .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] uh , i do see that . like i said , the only way to really fix that is to cut it out . [Patient] uh- .[SEP][Follow-up][Doctor] um , let's take a look in six months and then we'll go from there . sound like a plan ? [Patient] but we have n't hit a full year yet .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] i know . um , i would n't do any revisions anyway for scar tissue until we're at least a year out anyway . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] so let's wait those six months . you can keep using uh , the mederma scar gel twice a day . massage and scar gel will help for the scars . um , you can put it on other scars too , if you need . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] um , so that's what i would do . let's just get some pictures today so we can keep up um , with them . and keep an eye on these scars and then we'll go from there .

[Patient] uh , so , over the the weekend , we've been moving boxes up and down our basements stairs , and by the end of the day my knees were just killing me .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . is , is one knee worse than the other ? [Patient] equally painful .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and did you , did you injure one of them ? [Patient] um , uh , i've had some knee problems in the past but i think it was just the repetition and the weight of the boxes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . all right . and , and what have you taken for the pain ? [Patient] a little tylenol . i iced them for a bit . nothing really seemed to help , though .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] okay . all right . um , and does it prevent you from doing , like , your activities of daily living , like walking and exercising and things like that ? [Patient] uh , saturday night it actually kept me up for a bit . they were pretty sore .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm . okay . and any other symptoms like fever or chills ?

[Patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now . [Patient] yes . it's doing much better .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ? [Patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , that sounds good . [Patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ? [Patient] no , i'm not right now .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication . [Patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel . [Patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . [Patient] okay . i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? [Patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ? [Patient] twice a day .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ? [Patient] no , that's fine .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] how often are you using that one ? [Patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ? [Patient] i'm not .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ? [Patient] no wipes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ? [Patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ? [Patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk . [Patient] it is ? okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself . [Patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that . [Patient] yes , i did . thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it . [Patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] let's see . [Patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much . [Patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 . [Patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form . [Patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , mm-hmm . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else . [Patient] can you do the metro market ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find . [Patient] sure .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say . [Patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] correct , it's not a steroid . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .

for hep c so how're you doing today [Patient] i'm doing okay but i'm a little bit anxious about having hep c i've really surprised because i've been feeling fine they had done it as you know a screen as just part of my physical so i'm really surprised that that came back positive[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so in the past have any doctors ever told you that you had hep c [Patient] no never that's why i'm i'm so surprised[SEP][Other Socials][Drug History][Drug History][Doctor] okay so just you know i need to ask do you have a history of iv drug use or you know have known any hep c partners [Patient] i mean i used to party a lot and even did use iv drugs but i have been clean for over fifteen years now[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay that that's good i mean i'm i'm happy that you were able to to kick that habit i know a lot of my patients that i see you know they're still dealing with with those dements so i'm i'm i'm happy that you're able to do that so hopefully we can get you better okay [Patient] thank you[SEP][Drug History][Drug History][Doctor] so what about alcohol use is that something that you used to do a lot [Patient] i did i did i mean i i still have a beer here and there everyday but not as much as i used to[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay and have you ever smoked before [Patient] i do smoke i smoke about one to two cigarettes per day i've cut down a lot but i'm just having a hard time kicking those less too[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah yeah and that that's something i've got to work on too because hep c along with smoking you know both of those are n't are n't good so hopefully we can help you out you know if your pcp has n't prescribe something for you already and possibly we can we can do that for you as well [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so do you have any other medical conditions [Patient] no i'm actually other than that i just had my physical and i'm not taking any medications no i'm i'm pretty good otherwise[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay and what conditions would you say run in your family [Patient] i have high blood pressure diabetes and depression[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay alright so let me go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good and on general appearance you appear to be in no distress no jaundice on the skin on your heart exam you have a nice regular rhythm rate regular rate and rhythm with a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur is appreciated on your lung exam your lungs are clear without wheezes rales or rhonchi on your abdominal exam bowel sounds are present your abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly yes let me i will change that one splenomegaly and on your muscle exam there is no gait disturbance or edema so i did we i was able to review your your results of your recent lab work and your hcv antibody test was positive so your your liver panel we did one of those and it showed an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so that's pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you do have hepatitis c so your initial labs were consistent with that hep c diagnosis and so you know i do n't know if you read much about hep c but hepatitis c is a viral infection that does affect your liver and you've most likely had it for several years now it it it most patients do n't see symptoms until years later so the next step that i would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work so that includes checking your hep c rna and your hcv genotype and i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and we will do that by ordering an ultrasound elasto elastography with this information we will we we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment right so how does that sound [Patient] i hmmm so i do have a wife and kids so should i be worried about them[SEP]","476":"[Conversation

[Patient] yes . it's doing much better .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ? [Patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , that sounds good .

[Patient] no , i'm not right now .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .

[Patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . [Patient] okay . i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? [Patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?

[Patient] yeah , that sounds good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today . [Patient Guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense . [Patient Guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wow . okay . [Patient Guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ? [Patient Guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel . [Patient Guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mhm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ? [Patient Guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] got you . okay . [Patient Guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .[SEP]","482":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey gabriel

[Patient] but it normally does n't bother me .[SEP]","498":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 . hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ? [Patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [Patient] yes , i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [Patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Other Socials][Doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [Patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 . [Patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yep , right here . [Patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [Patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .[SEP][Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [Patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [Patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , good . [Patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ? [Patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ... [Patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [Patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .[SEP]","499":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] hey good to see you philip so i see here you're coming in you had some right elbow pain also you have a past medical history of hypertension diabetes we are gon na check up on those as well so can you tell me what happened to your elbow [Patient] sure i hurt it about a week ago playing lacrosse with my kids just suddenly started hurting me when i was throwing the ball[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay okay so how old are your kids [Patient] my oldest is thirteen and the other one is ten i was playing with a thirteen -year-old[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay yeah i know i i play with my kids sometimes and i think i'm getting too old to do all that so i just i've hurt myself before as well alright so with your your elbow what part of your elbow would you say hurts [Patient] it's really like right at the point of the elbow right at right at like the tip of it[SEP]","500":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hello .

new pcp last year and you know she has been doing a lot of changes to my medication and making sure everything is up to date and she my noticed that my blood pressure has been quite high so she added to medications but and but i you know i've been taking them i've been really good and i i before i was n't but now i am and we're still having a hard time controlling my blood pressure so she thought it would be a good idea for me to see you especially since she noted some on my last blood work she said something about my kidneys[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay yeah so okay let's before i dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling [Patient] i would say you know most of the days i feel fine i'm still busy at work i definitely can tell though when my blood pressure is high[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay you measure it at home you you you measure your blood pressure at home [Patient] yeah i she wanted me to get a blood pressure cuff so i did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home [Patient] yeah she i have a a electronic one an electronic arm one[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay okay yeah that's good that's good and have you ever tried do you go to cvs at all [Patient] yeah i i do but i've noticed like since the pandemic i do n't see the blood pressures anymore[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so [Patient] did they[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally [Patient] alright do you want the honest answer[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] well yeah that would be better [Patient] so i really you know with everything going on i really been trying to get better but i mean during football season it's really difficult i really love watching my games so have a lot of pizza wings subs like i said i've been trying to cut down especially on days where there is no games but it probably could be better[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches [Patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay what about chest pain [Patient] no chest pain[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] shortness of breath [Patient] no shortness of breath[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] even with exertion [Patient] even with exertion[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed [Patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure [Patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on [Patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve [Patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for [Patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends[SEP][Physical Examination][Follow-up][Medication][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Drug History][Doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me [Patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan [Patient] that sounds good thank you[SEP]","505":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] patient is julia jones , date of birth

complications from diabetes like kidney dysfunction and eye problems and things like that and i know that you are 74 and you know you have n't really had a lot of issues up until this point and you know so you have a you know still a long life to live so i would like to see you you know try to you know monitor your diet and and your blood sugars are you taking the metformin [Patient] yeah i

i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so looking here at your vital signs you know you do n't have a fever here in the office which is good your temperature is ninety eight . four on your blood pressure it seems like you are doing a pretty good job monitoring your blood pressure your blood pressure is right where it should be it's about one twenty five over sixty two which is good your heart rate is nice and slow in the eighties and your oxygenation is fine it's ninety seven percent on room air so all of that is is really good now on on your facial exam i'm just pressing on your face here do you have any pain to palpation [Patient] just right underneath my eyes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] on one on what side [Patient] actually both[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay okay on on facial examination the patient has pain to palpation of the bilateral maxillary sinuses on nasal exam there are there is erythema and edema of the nasal turbinates bilaterally with associated yellow discharge on throat exam can you open up your mouth on your throat exam the the uvula is midline there is no erythema or edema or exudate in the peritonsillar space on neck examination i do appreciate some bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and on your lung exam there is coarse rhonchi present bilaterally that clears with cough on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur and on your right knee exam does it hurt when i press here [Patient] yep[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay there is pain to palpation on the right knee and i'm just gon na move it all around does that hurt [Patient] little bit yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay so there is decreased flexion and extension of the right knee there is associated ecchymosis to the right medial knee there is no evidence of an effusion okay so billy what does all of that mean that means that you just have signs of that you have a little bit of an upper respiratory infection that might have caused some congestion in your in your lungs which we will talk about okay and then and as far as your knee exam it just shows that you do have some inflammation and some evidence that you had injured it earlier so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you for all of these issues okay so for your first problem of your cough you know i do believe that you just have a a viral syndrome at this time you probably have some mild bronchitis i really just wan na go ahead and just you know recommend some supportive care you can continue to take over the counter medications we can prescribe guaifenesin six hundred six hundred milligrams twice a day to help cough up some of that phlegm and i do n't think you need need any antibiotics at this time but certainly if your symptoms worsen i want you to call me and then we can go ahead and consider ordering a chest x-ray to make sure that you do n't have any pneumonia okay how does that sound [Patient] that sounds good[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] okay so for your second problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have a a a right medial collateral ligament strain from the fall this morning and i really wan na just go ahead and and i'll prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and we can refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen those muscles around that area and i'm gon na go ahead and just order a right knee x-ray just to make sure that you did n't injure any bones although i do n't think you did but we'll just go ahead and order that right knee x-ray how does that sound [Patient] okay that sounds like good good plan[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] okay and then for your third problem of your hypertension let's just continue on the lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and lastly your fourth problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c just to make sure we do n't have to make any adjustments to your metformin and i really want you to try to monitor your sugar intake and report your blood sugars to me through the patient portal how does that sound [Patient] okay i'll try that i try my best[SEP]","508":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] okay michael so i see in here

it[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] sure absolutely what can i help you with today [Patient] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now [Patient] i have an albuterol inhaler[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night [Patient] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens [Patient] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then when you use your inhaler [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] does it does it alleviate the problem [Patient] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler [Patient] okay[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] for the symptoms [Patient] yes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so [Patient] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that [Patient] no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening [Patient] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Drug History][Doctor] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems [Patient] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having [Patient] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation [Patient] so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too[SEP]","511":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] so gloria is a 46

hurt real bad and it got real swollen[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] wow okay so which wrist are we talking about left or right [Patient] it's my right one of course[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and then have you ever injured this arm before [Patient] no i have not[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright so on a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain [Patient] gosh it's like a nine[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] wow okay have you done anything to ease it [Patient] yeah i did the ice thing i put ice on it and then i you know i even i have a ace wrap at home i try to do that[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen [Patient] this happened yesterday morning[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry [Patient] yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere [Patient] no not really[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay any numbness any tingling [Patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well [Patient] yeah it does[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like [Patient] not without extreme pain[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up [Patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt [Patient] yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright and then lateral as well [Patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist [Patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you [Patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down [Patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better[SEP][Physical Examination][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to [Patient] i'm sorry[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] pardon what [Patient] a what[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace [Patient] okay thank you[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay [Patient] when do i have to have the surgery[SEP]","515":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12\/27\/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ? [Patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad . [Patient] yes , that's correct .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ? [Patient] yeah , that sounds good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today . [Patient Guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense . [Patient Guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wow . okay . [Patient Guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ? [Patient Guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel . [Patient Guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mhm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ? [Patient Guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] got you . okay . [Patient Guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] hmm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Chitchat][Doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ? [Patient Guest] only pepcid .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ? [Patient Guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ? [Patient Guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ? [Patient Guest] yes , that is correct . he did .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ? [Patient Guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that . [Patient Guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care . [Patient Guest] you're welcome .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ? [Patient Guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned . [Patient Guest] um , this is what she sent me , \" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . \" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ? [Patient Guest] correct . yep .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did . [Patient Guest] yes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ? [Patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ? [Patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ? [Patient] no , not that i've noticed .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um- [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP]","516":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] alright good morning Julie how are you doing today [Patient] i'm doing okay i'm just a little nervous about what's been going on with my headaches[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so i know you were sent here by your your pcp what was your understanding of why you were sent here [Patient] yeah so i actually have been someone who been struggling with headaches for years now ever since i was a teenager and they used to be around my when i would have my menstrual my menses but as i got older i noticed that it has been with that and also i can get it when i'm really stressed but recently and why i went to her is because my headaches have been getting a lot more they've just been happening a lot more frequently and a lot more severe[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay can you tell me a little bit about them what how do they how do they feel when they come on [Patient] so they say mostly on my right side and it even seems like it's like behind my eye and it just like this pulsing like this really bad pulsing sensation[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse i know you said they they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse [Patient] i i have noticed that you know i've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight but i ca n't even really exercise for very long because i start of as soon as i start to jog i my headaches the headaches come back on a lot worse so i notice it when i'm exercising[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches [Patient] i've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now and then what really scared me is that now i'm starting to get some blurred vision it's not all the time but it it will come and go but some blurred like on the in my on the side of my vision[SEP]","517":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey joshua good to see you today so take a look at your chart here brenda and i see that you're coming in you you have i think you have a kidney stone so can you tell me what's going on how are you feeling and you're my my patient [Patient] and i'm your patient yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so is it is it a constant pain or does it come and go for you [Patient] it comes and goes it depends on how much i've been drinking and you know what sort of activities i've been doing but it's still there[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] alright so have you noticed any pain when you've been urinating [Patient] not really[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay have you noticed any blood in your urine [Patient] no blood i did have an episode where the pain radiated to one of my testicles which was kinda weird but but yeah it it sort of calmed down a little bit in that regards[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain [Patient] yeah i've been taking some ibuprofen and that kinda like calms it down a little bit but it persists[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and what would you say like your pain score is out of ten [Patient] it's probably a four out of ten when it gets a little more out of control for the most part it's probably in the order of one or two out of ten[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so it is it's it's it's not too bad [Patient] it's a new ones yeah but i know it's there it does n't go away[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay yeah yeah a lot of my patients you know have that that minor pain so you [Patient] i'm a horrible active by the way[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] no yeah that's that's that's totally fine that's totally fine you know i'm just playing the doctor on tv so good good alright so have you had any other symptoms nausea vomiting anything like that [Patient] no nausea no vomiting i had some i felt like it might have been like chills but no fevers nothing along those lines[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay that's good do you know anybody in your family that has had kidney stones in the past [Patient] yeah all in my family has had kidney stones in the past[SEP][Family History][Doctor] no well they did n't set you up good did they [Patient] yeah i i i guess i can blame them but but yeah it's been a it's been an issue with the family for as long as i've been aware of[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright and i'm reading here it looks like you've had them before as well right [Patient] i have yeah i passed some by myself and i've had to have surgery a couple of times as well[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so the ones that you passed by yourself how many days would you say it would take to to pass [Patient] usually within within a week i manage to to get them out[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay alright so you got anything fun plan for the weekend [Patient] just getting this pain under control[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay well that that sounds like a good plan we can definitely help you out with that alright so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated and i think that's probably because you're in pain and that's understandable everything else looks fine so on pressing on your abdomen does that hurt [Patient] no no no pain[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in [Patient] yeah it's a little tender yeah it's little tender[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Radiology Examination][Reassessment][Doctor] okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of high flow nephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you [Patient] so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer [Patient] they did they did yeah and i've been i've been using that but so far nothing[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate so hopefully we can catch the stone i'm also gon na order a bmp a urinalysis and urine culture and based on what that shows we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics i do n't think you have an infection but you know there is that possibility and then i want to see you again in one to two weeks if you are still having symptoms and if you know you still have the stone with you we can talk about further treatment possible lithotripsy you know that's the shockwave treatment i'm pretty sure you've had that prior to [Patient] yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i want[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] what that is okay so do you have any other questions for me [Patient] no i'm friend[SEP][Follow-up][Doctor] alright so i'll see you again in two weeks i'll have my nurse come in and bring you that prescription for the tramadol and i think we are all good [Patient] perfect thank you[SEP]","518":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , james , how are

Symptoms][Doctor] okay and are and do you still have pain down there in your lower back [Patient] if i turn a certain way or if i roll over in my sleep i'll wake up from it from a like a sharp pain but then that that goes away if i if i position myself the right way[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and what have you been taking for the pain [Patient] i took some tylenol i took some ibuprofen i've tried heat i've tried ice and nothing really seems to help[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay is the ibuprofen any better than the tylenol [Patient] a little bit but for sure a shorter period of time[SEP][Therapeutic History][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and did you get any stomach upset from the ibuprofen [Patient] no i try not to take too much so i i do n't have an upset stomach from it[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and did you go to like an urgent care centing or an emergency room have you had any imaging on this at all [Patient] i went to an urgent care and they wanted me to do an mri but i was a little concerned because i think we maxed out our insurance so i i did n't do it because it started to feel better but because it's been going on so long i'm i'm a little bit concerned now i i do wan na actually move forward with that[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright and any other symptoms any problems with like your bladder or your bowels any incontinence or you know you feel like you ca n't go to the bathroom [Patient] no i have n't had any of those issues[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright and any other any other past medical history do you that you have any [Patient] i had knee surgery about two years ago on my right knee[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and what did you have done to your right knee [Patient] it was a total knee replacement[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay a total knee replacement in twenty eighteen is that what you said [Patient] no it was actually about two years ago so it's the spring of twenty twenty[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright alright well i wan na go ahead and just move on to a physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] now you have you had any fever or chills with this [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright alright so looking at your vital signs here in the office you know they look really good your you you do n't have any temperature your blood pressure is good it's about one seventeen over fifty six [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty eight and your oxygenation is fine at ninety five percent on room air so that means everything looks good [Patient] good[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] on your neck exam i i do appreciate some bony protuberance of the c5 c6 do you have any pain when i touch here [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] no okay on your lumbar spine exam i do appreciate do you have pain when i touch here [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay so there is no pain to palpation of the lumbar spine there is decreased flexion and extension of the lower back the patient does have a positive straight leg raise and there is some spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine on musculoskeletal exam the lower extremities strength is equal bilaterally so what does that mean jeremy that means that you have some you know maybe a some arthritis in your neck here and or maybe just a a little bit of some injury from from that from that back that back thing that you told me about [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] okay but i think overall things look really good so you know i had them do an lumbar spine x-ray on you before i saw you and i looked at the results of your lumbar spine x-ray which showed no acute bony abnormality you know there was no fracture of your back or anything which is not surprising based on your history so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so i do believe it sounds like you have an acute disk herniation now this did happen a few months ago but it sounds like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having symptoms [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Referral][Doctor] i do wan na go ahead and order a a lumbar spine mri to get a a a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they do n't show us any of the soft tissue so let's go ahead and order the lumbar spine mri i wan na continue with physical therapy so i'm going to refer you to a a physical therapist through our health system [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Medication][Doctor] and then i also wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] to help with that do you have any questions about that [Patient] no questions[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] now if you do have a herniated disk we can go ahead and talk about some other treatment options maybe like an epidural steroid injection to help take down some of that inflammation [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP]","523":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hi michelle what's been going on the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee [Patient] yeah i'm gon na have to keep this my favorite story is that i had a sandra who injured her knee cold dancing so that would immediately came up to

okay and were you able to ski down the hill or did you have to be taken down by the ski patrol [Patient] i had to be taken down by the ski patrol i was unable to bear weight[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay is n't that slightly terrifying they had to do the same thing for me and you're just kind of sitting there watching all of the trees go by so anyway so what part of your knee is bothering you the most is it the inside the outside [Patient] it hurts on the outside but it also feels like it wo n't hold my weight[SEP]","524":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] so elizabeth is a 53 -year-old female today complaining of chest pain and she has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure so elizabeth tell me what's going on with your with your chest pain [Patient] i do n't know every time i start walking i'm just having this kind of pressure and chest pain in my chest[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay are you having it now or is it gone right now [Patient] right now it's not there[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and how long have you been having this [Patient] probably maybe three months[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and what seemed to bring it on anything exacerbated or relieve it [Patient] it mainly happens when i'm walking i like to try and walk but lately i just have n't been able to keep up with it because i'm having this pain[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright and well how would you describe this pain it's like a dull pain sharp pain stabbing pain how would you describe it [Patient] i would say it's dull it's kinda like a pressure[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and does it go anywhere or radiate any place [Patient] no[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright but no chest pain right now no shortness of breath no sweats or clamminess or anything like that right now [Patient] nothing right now[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay alright well certainly you know i looked at your ekg that did we did in the office when you came in the ekg i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so i'm you know we should definitely talk about the plan for this chest pain in a few minutes but right now the good news is i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so let's talk a little bit about your other conditions since you are here today how are you doing with your diabetes i know we have you on metformin and we talked about last time about you know improving your diet and exercise i'm glad you're exercising but i'm so sorry to hear about the chest pain so tell me about how is that going [Patient] yeah i mean i think my blood sugars have been a little higher because i have n't been able to be active and i'm trying with the diet you know i do love sodas so i'm really trying strength dose[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah i i am addicted to diet coke myself so i i hear you on that one and we had checked your hemoglobin a1c last time it was you know seven . which is pretty good it's not you know it could be better but it's not it's not bad and we talked about sending you to ophthalmology also for an eye exam have you seen ophthalmology in the last few months or last before i saw you [Patient] i have an appointment in two weeks it was a long waiting[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay got it and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that with your diabetes or any side effects from your medications the metformin [Patient] no[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright good and i saw also there was a record in your i was looking at your record before previously before i walked in you also had we've been checking your blood pressure but but i think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure have you noticed any findings with that or have you know have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that because we do n't have it in our system here yet but i did add it in today but we do n't have you on any medications yet for that [Patient] no i mean i do n't know doc no one told me about high blood pressure do i have high blood pressure[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well i think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the your blood pressure was elevated so they had mentioned that i noticed a trend in your blood pressure it's been running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years [Patient] okay do you think that could be causing me my my chest pain[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so [Patient] someone had told me before[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah me too but we we can we can definitely you know get you started on some monitoring devices for that and also maybe start you on some some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure and maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay [Patient] okay sounds good[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Referral][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness so what does all this mean i'll explain that in a second so basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs so you know with this chest pain i'm a little bit so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily i'm also gon na give you a prescription just a baby aspirin you can take eighty one milligrams once a day and also i'm gon na give you a prescription for nitroglycerin it's a it's a little pill you split underneath your tongue if you have this chest pain if it does n't go away after one or two pills i want you to go to the hospital call nine one one and go to the hospital but we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart okay any questions about that [Patient] so anytime i have a chest pain even if i'm just like walking i have to take that pill[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah if you if you stop walking the chest pain goes away you do n't have to take the pill but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away i would take the pill and see if it goes away if it does not [Patient] how long like how long do i wait to see if it goes away[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes and if it does n't go away then i would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because i worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it does n't lead to a heart attack those chest pain could be a you know a a a sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly [Patient] okay[SEP]","525":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal

little worse after a meal[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] hmmm okay [Patient] in the morning before i've eaten it's it's not too bad but during the day after a meal it gets worse[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright and do you notice that pain radiates anywhere or moves you know any or anywhere [Patient] it's pretty low it might radiate a little bit to the left but otherwise it's pretty localized to the right side[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and have you had any nausea or vomiting along with the pain [Patient] i've had some nausea and a little bit of heartburn but no vomiting[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and and this is this is this is worse with you said worse worse with meals and is there anything else anything else that that makes it worse [Patient] it is

blood in your urine [Patient] no no urinary symptoms[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and how about any diarrhea and any of that or blood in your stool no [Patient] no change in bowels[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright and so would you say that your appetite has been normal or decreased or any different [Patient] well since i'm a little nauseated i'm not quite as hungry and i feel just kind of a little overall a little more fatigued over the last week[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay okay you did n't overeat you know during the super bowl last weekend did you that was i know probably lots of junk food floating around if your house is anything like mine [Patient] well once the packers are out of the playoffs i do n't watch the super bowl so nothing i have n't eaten anything unusual[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay well that's good that's good and and no no travel i know you're a big big travel travel fan you know i remember you telling me about your trip to europe last summer that sounded amazing have you been traveling outside of the country again recently [Patient] not recently just back to wisconsin but no unusual travel or other exposures[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright great and okay so so tell me about your migraines how have they been are you still taking the sumatriptan you know as needed when when you developed migraine you have have you had a migraine recently [Patient] i have not usually they are responsive to just excedrin migraine i use the sumatriptan when i need to if it if it does n't respond to the over the counter analgesic[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay okay great yeah you've learned a lot about it and and the treatments including the the term analgesic and all of that that's pretty impressive you've been you've been through the ringer i think with with those so okay and so you're taking excedrin when you get a migraine and then sort of would you say maybe for breakthrough migraines or worse migraines you'd take a sumatriptan occasionally [Patient] yeah[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay got it and how about your blood pressure how has that been running at home are you checking your blood pressures daily still and how how your how how have your blood pressures been [Patient] i have not been checking them daily i i probably check it about two or three times a week[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay okay not not too bad it does look like you're a little bit elevated today i i maybe i'm just making you nervous though so i hope not so are you but you're still on lisinopril twenty milligrams per day correct it looks like you might be running low do you need a refill of that [Patient] yeah actually i was going to ask you about that if i could get a refill that would be great[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] sure we can do that and so okay but you are still taking that twenty milligrams per day correct [Patient] correct[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay and alright fair enough so so let's go ahead and and examine you now karen so on your physical exam pretty normal and and unremarkable for the most part on your on your heart exam i do hear that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that you've still got that's unchanged from prior exam that just means i hear some heart sounds you know as i'm listening to your heart there i'm not too concerned about that we'll watch that otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and then your your abdominal exam gastrointestinal exam you have some tenderness in the right upper quadrant i would say mild to moderate tenderness and now if you take a deep breath does that and i press here does that hurt you [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay yeah you have i would call an equivocal murphy's sign in the right upper quadrant on your abdominal examination as well the rest of your abdomen is soft and no significant tenderness you have no tenderness in the right lower quadrant with deep palpation and you have no cva tenderness on your back exam as well and so we will talk about about that i am a little bit concerned about the tenderness that that i find on your abdominal exam the remainder of your exam karen is pretty normal and unremarkable and and so that's good let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan so first of all for your first problem of abdominal pain you you do seem to have acute abdominal pain with right upper quadrant tenderness that i'm concerned maybe a sign of some gallstones or possibly even an infection in your gallbladder so i'm gon na order some blood tests and an ultrasound today i'm gon na order a cbc chem twelve urinalysis a pregnancy test and also right upper quadrant ultrasound and so we will we will get those tests done right away i'm gon na keep you here we'll see how those look fortunately we've got the facilities for those and if we need to send you to the emergency department based on those results we will i do n't want you to eat anything right now okay in case we find something that might require surgery alright unlikely but it's possible and then okay you know karen i meant to ask you on your history one thing by chance have you had a fever along with this abdominal pain [Patient] i've had some chills but no documented fevers[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Reassessment][Drug History][Doctor] okay alright alright good yeah i i see you do n't have a fever today so that's that's good and so alright now for your second problem the migraine headaches you you do have a history of chronic migraines and and you have occasional bouts of of migraines nothing recent so let's continue the excedrin as needed over the counter for treatment there and then also the sumatriptan as needed for breakthrough migraine pain and i i would just encourage you to continue to avoid alcohol binges and caffeine binges and try to get enough sleep and all of that's easier said than done i know so but but that seems to be helping you now for your third problem of hypertension your blood pressure seems to be under adequate control so that's good we'll continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams per day and i will write you a refill prescription for that and send that to the pharmacy please continue to check your blood pressures daily so karen how does that all sound for a plan any other questions for me [Patient] i actually do need a refill on my sumatriptan as well[SEP]","526":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Therapeutic History][Doctor] all right . this is matthew rogers . date of birth 5\/24\/2007 . i

[Patient] all right , how have you been ?[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm good . [Patient] good , good .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle ? you look trim . [Patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt . makes you look thin . [Patient] yeah , i guess that's it .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ? [Patient] good , the testosterone's going well .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] that's great . [Patient] uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , well that's good . [Patient] so the finasteride i'm only taking half a pill , it's the 5 milligram one .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that . [Patient] and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] in and out . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there . [Patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ? [Patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] right . [Patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] wow , that's remarkable . [Patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .[SEP][Discussion][Lab Examination][Doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it . [Patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference . [Patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] absolutely . [Patient] my red blood cell count has increased .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though . [Patient] stable .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think . [Patient] yeah . , is it ?[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good . [Patient] nice , that's good news .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so . [Patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me . [Patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] well , your levels are high . [Patient] are they right now ?[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] well , i mean they were last time . [Patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ? [Patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] all right . [Patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Reassessment][Doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well . [Patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 . [Patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still . [Patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] true . but right now i would not change your dose . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] make sense ? [Patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Other Socials][Doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ? [Patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .[SEP]","528":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] alright scott so so i understand that you

weight on it but it feels just really loose it it does n't feel normal[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] gotcha okay alright well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before i take a look at your knee here i'm gon na do a physical exam and in terms of your gait here i did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation so let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick i do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of ecchymosis let me just feel around here scott how does that feel does that hurt when i kinda press on that there [Patient] a little bit of pain there not not really bad it's it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel [Patient] just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam fifty milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan [Patient] it it does now well i need to limit my work activities i i typically sit behind a desk but it's not been very comfortable sitting here lately[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Doctor] yeah definitely so yeah so you you can limit the activities for sure in terms of your work activities i know if you sit too long sometimes it can be painful because you do need to move that leg a little bit so it does n't lock up so i i would like for you to you know do do some slight activities not enough to stress your legs but definitely move move them a little bit every now and then so it does n't lock up on you okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] alright i do want you to i know you are i know you actually jog often so i want you to just slow that down for a bit no jogging for a while until we get you know results of your mri till we figure out what we what we are gon na be doing okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] alright and how's your dog you has it been jogging with you before this incident [Patient] how's just how's my dog or how is my job[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] your your dog [Patient] my my my dog is okay[SEP]","529":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] all right , new patient , jordan roberts . date of birth : 3\/2\/1972 . he's a 49 year old , uh hm , with hypertension and palpitations . please copy forward his thyroid profile from march 1st , 2021 . hello mr. roberts , how are you doing today ? [Patient] i'm fine , thank you .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] good . good . so , i saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations . [Patient] yeah . that was back in march i think , but my girlfriend and i , we talked about it , and on that day i had a few cups of coffee , and no breakfast . so , i think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah . have you , uh , have you felt it again since ? [Patient] uh , no .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . uh , so tell me about the blood pressure then . [Patient] well , i've had issues with my blood pressure since i was young .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] do you have a family history of this ? [Patient] yeah . a lot of my family does have high blood pressure .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] uh , can you tell me which medications you're taking ? [Patient] my new med is , uh , a combo med , something 40-25 .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . um . yes , i see that in your chart . the benicar hct . it has hydrochlorothiazide in it . [Patient] yeah , that's it . my water pill i call it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . are you still taking the amlodipine , 10 milligrams daily ? [Patient] uh , yes i am .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] that's- that's a good start on a regimen . are you checking your blood pressure at home , and if yes , what numbers are you seeing ? [Patient] um , every day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] awesome . [Patient] yeah . every morning , i take it when i get up , and it's been running at about , uh , 146 to 155 lately .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so you're not down in the 120s yet ? [Patient] no , not yet . well , we're trying to get there though .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . uh , how are you doing with your salt intake ? [Patient] i'm trying to back off of it . i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure . [Patient] sounds good .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] are you doing any exercise ? [Patient] i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great . [Patient] good to hear .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts . [Patient] nope . nowhere .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ? [Patient] uh , no .[SEP][Discussion][Reassessment][Doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone . [Patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try . [Patient] all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room . [Patient] all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay . [Patient] all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?[SEP]","530":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] good morning ms. reyes !

[Patient] no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] great .

[Patient] uh yeah , that's right .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great . [Patient] good , that's a relief to hear .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though . [Patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march . [Patient] all righty .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today . [Patient] all righty that sounds good .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good . [Patient] okay great . that all sounds awesome .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right let's take a quick listen . use my general physical exam template . and take a couple of deep breaths for me . your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things . [Patient] all righty .[SEP][Other Treatments][Doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine . [Patient] yeah , that'll be okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand . [Patient] yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me .[SEP][Follow-up][Doctor] perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june . [Patient] okay , i'll put that down .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today . [Patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ? [Patient] yeah , i have both .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like . [Patient] okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Referral][Other Treatments][Doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield . [Patient] okay , that sounds good .[SEP]","537":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hi billy how are you doing the medical assistant told me that you have a cough today [Patient]

notes here is you here he had positive lab work for hep c so how're you doing today [Patient] i'm doing okay but i'm a little bit anxious about having hep c i've really surprised because i've been feeling fine they had done it as you know a screen as just part of my physical so i'm really surprised that that came back positive[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so in the past have any doctors ever told you that you had hep c [Patient] no never that's why i'm i'm so surprised[SEP][Other Socials][Drug History][Drug History][Doctor] okay so just you know i need to ask do you have a history of iv drug use or you know have known any hep c partners [Patient] i mean i used to party a lot and even did use iv drugs but i have been clean for over fifteen years now[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay that that's good i mean i'm i'm happy that you were able to to kick that habit i know a lot of my patients that i see you know they're still dealing with with those dements so i'm i'm i'm happy that you're able to do that so hopefully we can get you better okay [Patient] thank you[SEP][Drug History][Drug History][Doctor] so what about alcohol use is that something that you used to do a lot [Patient] i did i did i mean i i still have a beer here and there everyday but not as much as i used to[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay and have you ever smoked before [Patient] i do smoke i smoke about one to two cigarettes per day i've cut down a lot but i'm just having a hard time kicking those less too[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah yeah and that that's something i've got to work on too because hep c along with smoking you know both of those are n't are n't good so hopefully we can help you out you know if your pcp has n't prescribe something for you already and possibly we can we can do that for you as well [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so do you have any other medical conditions [Patient] no i'm actually other than that i just had my physical and i'm not taking any medications no i'm i'm pretty good otherwise[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay and what conditions would you say run in your family [Patient] i have high blood pressure diabetes and depression[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay alright so let me go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good and on general appearance you appear to be in no distress no jaundice on the skin on your heart exam you have a nice regular rhythm rate regular rate and rhythm with a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur is appreciated on your lung exam your lungs are clear without wheezes rales or rhonchi on your abdominal exam bowel sounds are present your abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly yes let me i will change that one splenomegaly and on your muscle exam there is no gait disturbance or edema so i did we i was able to review your your results of your recent lab work and your hcv antibody test was positive so your your liver panel we did one of those and it showed an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so that's pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you do have hepatitis c so your initial labs were consistent with that hep c diagnosis and so you know i do n't know if you read much about hep c but hepatitis c is a viral infection that does affect your liver and you've most likely had it for several years now it it it most patients do n't see symptoms until years later so the next step that i would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work so that includes checking your hep c rna and your hcv genotype and i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and we will do that by ordering an ultrasound elasto elastography with this information we will we we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment right so how does that sound [Patient] i hmmm so i do have a wife and kids so should i be worried about them[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] okay yeah so we can start with the same screening that you had for august first so we'll just let's do that hep c antibody test and i'll actually help you set up those appointments with your your family doctor and then we can just see you back in three weeks and based on the results you know we will take action as needed okay [Patient] okay that sounds good[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] alright [Patient] alright[SEP]","539":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , andrew . how are you ?

[Patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [Patient] yes , i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [Patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Other Socials][Doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [Patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 . [Patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yep , right here . [Patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [Patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .[SEP][Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [Patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [Patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , good .

[Patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ... [Patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [Patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you . [Patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated . [Patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [Patient] okay , thank you . got it .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ? [Patient] no , not that i know of .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . [Patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ? [Patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay . we might give you some of that . [Patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ? [Patient] yes , i also do have that problem .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that . [Patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , sounds good . [Patient] great .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [Patient] okay , i will do that .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future . [Patient] okay , that's okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not . [Patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range . [Patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [Patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .[SEP][Personal History][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [Patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , this is much better . [Patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [Patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [Patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [Patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started . [Patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] does that make sense ? [Patient] yes , it does .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study . [Patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you . [Patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify . [Patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up . [Patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you . [Patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be . [Patient] okay , will do .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know . [Patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets . [Patient] okay , sounds good .[SEP][Medication][Other Treatments][Drug History][Doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ? [Patient] yes , that sounds great .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though . [Patient] okay , that would be great .[SEP]","543":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Radiology Examination][Doctor] this is philip gutierrez , date of birth 1\/12\/71 . he is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand . he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 polyregion , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger , because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of , quote , \" fds tendon , \" end quote . he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr , pa at that institution . at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4\/24\/2021 , which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint , partial-thickness tear of the right fds , and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact , as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact . his x-rays , four views of the right hand today , show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand , no soft tissue shadows of concern , no arthritis . hi , how are you , mr . gutierrez ?

[Patient] so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ? [Patient] um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ? [Patient] yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .[SEP]","544":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , james , how are you ?

[Patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now . [Patient] yes . it's doing much better .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ? [Patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , that sounds good . [Patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ? [Patient] no , i'm not right now .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication . [Patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel . [Patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . [Patient] okay . i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? [Patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ? [Patient] twice a day .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ? [Patient] no , that's fine .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] how often are you using that one ? [Patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ? [Patient] i'm not .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ? [Patient] no wipes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ? [Patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ? [Patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk . [Patient] it is ? okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself . [Patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that . [Patient] yes , i did . thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it . [Patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] let's see . [Patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much . [Patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 . [Patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form . [Patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , mm-hmm . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else . [Patient] can you do the metro market ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find . [Patient] sure .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say . [Patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] correct , it's not a steroid . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad . [Patient] okay . got it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ? [Patient] okay , thank you for explaining .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so i will say , \" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . \" [Patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash. [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ? [Patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you . [Patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day . [Patient] that sounds good .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping . [Patient] okay , sounds good .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here . [Patient] thank you so much .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly . [Patient] sounds good .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream . [Patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ? [Patient] yeah , sounds good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] do you have enough refills ? [Patient] yeah , i think so .[SEP]","546":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , edward , how are you ? [Patient] i'm doing well , yourself ?[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm doing okay .

[Patient] no . none of those . i do , do notice that i get a little bit of a de- , uh , swelling in my ankles .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . all right . all right . maybe that has to do with some of the salt intake you're , you're eating . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . well , i wan na go ahead and do a quick physical exam , okay ? [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] hey , dragon ? show me the blood pressure . yeah , so , your blood pressure's a little elevated today , 156 over 94 . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] you know , you could be a little happy to see me . i do n't know . um , but let's look at some of the readings . hey , dragon ? show me the blood pressure readings . yeah , so , they've been a , running a little high over the past couple months . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] so , we'll have to just kinda talk about that , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart and lungs , and i'll let you know what i find , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . all right . so , on physical exam , you know , everything looks good . on your heart exam , i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur , but we've heard that in the past . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Doctor] so , that seems stable to me . um , on your lung exam , everything sounds nice and clear , and on your lower extremity exam , i do appreciate , you know , 1 to 2+ pitting edema in your legs , okay ? so , we'll have to just talk a little bit about your diet and decreasing the salt intake , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Radiology Examination][Doctor] so , let me just look at some of your results , okay ? hey , dragon ? show me the labs . so , looking here at your lab results , everything looks really good . you know , your creatinine , that's your kidney function , that looks stable . everything looks good from that standpoint . hey , dragon ? show me the ekg . and , looking here at your ekg , everything , you know , looks fine . there's no evidence of any coronary artery disease . it's a nice , normal ekg , which is good . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so , let me just talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you . okay ? so , from a depression standpoint , it's , you know , your first problem , i think that that sounds like you're doing really well managing it . you know , you have good strategies . it sounds like you have a good support system , um , and i agree . i do n't think you need to start on any medication at this time , but you said before , you know you can call me , okay ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] for your second problem , your hypertension , i , i do n't believe it's well controlled at this time . so , i wan na go ahead and , you know , increase the norvasc up to 10 mg a day , and i wan na go ahead and order an echocardiogram and a lipid panel , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] hey , dragon ? order an echocardiogram . and , for your third problem , your rotator cuff repair , i , i think you're doing really well with that . i would just continue with the exercises and , uh , i do n't think we need to intervene upon that anymore . it sounds like that's pretty much resolved , okay ? [Patient] good . good .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] do you have any questions about anything ? [Patient] no questions .[SEP]","547":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] okay  good morning [Patient] good morning thanks doctor doctor cooper i'm i'm you know i'm a little i'm sad to be in here but you know thanks for taking me in i appreciate it[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] sure absolutely what can i help you with today [Patient] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now [Patient] i have an albuterol inhaler[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night [Patient] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens [Patient] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then when you use your inhaler [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] does it does it alleviate the problem [Patient] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler [Patient] okay[SEP]","548":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] okay . maria martin , date of birth 03\/05\/1946 , has been informed and consents to have this visit recorded . the patient is here for follow-up . hi , maria . how have you been doing ?

school is actually going well gotten good grades[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] they usually do anybody who chooses to engage in physics for the rest of their life i question their choices it's fine okay but are you when you're like while you are at school like has anybody been sick i know like with you know covid has been going around but like have you noticed anybody like that sick all the time around you [Patient] sick all the time everybody is sick these days[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] alright [Patient] so[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] but what about at home how about your siblings are any of them sick [Patient] most of them are healthy yeah most of them are healthy although you know i have a brother who smokes i have told him not to smoke he does n't listen[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] house told not to smoke at the house but you know anyway[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct [Patient] yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay [Patient] sure[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain [Patient] no[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerular nephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment [Patient] how much are all these tests going to cost[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them [Patient] okay that's that's good to know[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today [Patient] okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] and right after that i have to go to work[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh [Patient] well yeah this new job there is no insurance and my old boss sucks so i'm hoping i'll get a new boss and you know hopefully some free food with with this ut because it's had a restaurant so we'll we'll see how that goes[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] we might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we do n't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay [Patient] got it[SEP]","553":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 . hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ? [Patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [Patient] yes , i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [Patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Other Socials][Doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [Patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 . [Patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yep , right here . [Patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [Patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .[SEP][Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [Patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [Patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , good . [Patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ? [Patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ... [Patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [Patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you . [Patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated . [Patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [Patient] okay , thank you . got it .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ? [Patient] no , not that i know of .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . [Patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ? [Patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay . we might give you some of that . [Patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ? [Patient] yes , i also do have that problem .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that . [Patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , sounds good . [Patient] great .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [Patient] okay , i will do that .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future . [Patient] okay , that's okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not . [Patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range . [Patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [Patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .[SEP][Personal History][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [Patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , this is much better . [Patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [Patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [Patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [Patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started . [Patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] does that make sense ? [Patient] yes , it does .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study . [Patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you . [Patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify . [Patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up . [Patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you . [Patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be . [Patient] okay , will do .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know . [Patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP]","554":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on [Patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta [Patient] yes and and fish oil[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that [Patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy[SEP][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so [Patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging [Patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then[SEP][Referral][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time [Patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack[SEP][Referral][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies [Patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking [Patient] i thought it was close to sixty[SEP][Other Treatments][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet [Patient] yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results[SEP][Personal History][Lab Examination][Doctor] i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist [Patient] oh[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] that's your kidney doctor [Patient] i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil [Patient] right yeah that's i threw all of those out[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span [Patient] i'm a more of a san francisco fan[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again [Patient] okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] you can take tylenol [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur on your heart which i've heard before in the past and it does n't it does n't look like you're retaining any fluid which is good but you do have a little puffiness in your legs which sometimes some of the medications can cause [Patient] yeah i do have that[SEP][Referral][Medication][Reassessment][Doctor] so let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and and plan for you going forward so for your first problem of your coronary artery disease i think you're doing really well i wan na go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in in exercising again okay and i am gon na go ahead and refill your metoprolol your crestor forty milligrams once a day as well as the aspirin okay i do n't think we need to proceed with a a stress test or anything at this time but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay [Patient] okay[SEP]","555":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] good afternoon matthew how are you [Patient] i'm okay[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] it looks like here that the that you've been brought in for some vision changes and looks like you're having trouble with your right eye can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in to see me today [Patient] yeah you know i started noticing my wife and i we we eat out almost every night and it's when especially when we go to fancy place[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] i have trouble adjusting in the that dark dim environment[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and i reviewed my technician's notes before i came in to see you and it says you know you you've been having that decreased vision when you're reading especially in dark place like you just said but it also mentions here that it looks like you told her that when you look at straight lines like in your door frame it looks like things have been looking a little crooked to you how long has that been going on [Patient] well you know it's been going on a little while probably getting worse over the last three to four months and you know my my office has paneling and you know how that paneling has that dark grooves in it those straight lines well they always look wavy to me[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay alright so it's been going on a few months now you mentioned that you and your wife go out to eat every night have you tried the new the new italium place over there on main street [Patient] my gosh yes we were just there the other night down in the it's down in the basement of that big building yeah we went there the other night and i got ta tell you it was like the saprano family was sitting across from us there was this bunch of old guys that had bottles of of red wine all over the table and they were my gosh it was so good and the food i mean i mean i ca n't tell you how great the food was[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it was amazing my wife and i went over there the other day and when we walked downstairs it was like i was walking into a scene out of saprano's [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] but the food was amazing it was the best egg plant parmer's john i've i've ever had where really super excited about going back there here very very soon [Patient] yeah i had the bio marsal and it was my gosh it was to die for[SEP][Drug History][Drug History][Doctor] i'll have to get that next time i go so in reviewing your paperwork here it looks like you made mention that you smoke are you still smoking about a pack a day [Patient] yeah i i tried i've tried i've done hypnosis i've done lozenges i've done chewing gum and i get real close but you know i'll just go out one evening without the wife and and the next thing i know i'm i'm you know buying a cigarette off of somebody and it's it's really hard for me to get that stopped[SEP][Therapeutic History][Drug History][Doctor] yeah i i appreciate that but it's really gon na be important that you try to to either cut back or quit smoking altogether now that leads me into my next concern here it looks like you have a history of high blood pressure and i'm just wondering are you are you taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and and are you checking your blood pressures on a regular basis [Patient] i'm glad you just mentioned that because i have n't taken my blood pressure pill for a while it's up in the cupboard and it's back in that corner and i just i ca n't forget to take it[SEP][Therapeutic History][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay it's really gon na be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed i'd really like to see you start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and and let's set that that pill bottle down on the counter and see if that does n't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam on your eyes i'm gon na go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me [Patient] okay that's a bright light[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Medication][Doctor] yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection [Patient] have you ever somebody stick a needle in your eye[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah literally yeah [Patient] yeah[SEP]","556":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi kyle how are you today

Symptoms][Doctor] so i see here that your primary care provider sent you over it looks like you were doing some yard work yesterday and dropped a landscape brick on your foot can what so what's going

so you say you've injured your right foot before tell me a little bit about that injury [Patient] twenty years ago i broke my ankle i had to put in a cast but that seems to be okay but you know

up and keep working or did you have to get off your you know not stop weightbearing and and get off that foot can you tell me a little bit about after the traumatic incident [Patient] i you know it was a little sore i called a few names you know god damn why is this in my foot but you know i kept working putting it around a little bit but now it's got swollen so i got to see my doctor he told me i had to go see you here i am so tell me what's going on with it[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so what have you been doing for the pain since the initial insult [Patient] lucken it up[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you taken any medications safe for example tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain [Patient] no i feel like taking the medicine[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay and

sounds good now just out of curiosity can you rate your pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life [Patient] eleven out of ten[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numbness or tingling of that foot since the incident [Patient] yeah the whole foot is numb[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Follow-up][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay i'm gon na do a quick physical exam now your vitals look good and i would like to do a focused exam of your right foot the there is some bruising on the bottom part of your foot and on the top part as well and i do appreciate the associated swelling and i also recognize that you do have tenderness to palpation for midfoot now for your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is brisk in less than three seconds i do note a strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse with motor and sensation is intact for that foot i also like to call out the fact that it matches bilaterally which is important i'm gon na go ahead and review the diagnostic imaging results so we did a x-ray of that right foot and i do notice dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to your second metatarsal bone and the top of your foot this is where the metatarsals meet those cuboids okay so it where the bones come together in your foot now there are a lot of ligaments in your foot so i do want to order an mri just to assess if there is any injuries to those ligaments now based on your exam and looking at the x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery now the reason why this is important is if we have poor bone alignment or ligament healing you can this can lead to losing the arch in your foot you could becoming flat-footed and also developing arthritis now what's gon na be key here is the surgery is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly we are going to put them back into place using plates and screws now the key thing is going to be it's going to be outpatient surgery so it's going to be same day i'll see you in the morning and then you'll be discharged home that evening and we will do a follow-up i wan na see you in twenty four hours post procedure but then i'll see you again in two weeks you're gon na be in a cast and i'm gon na have you use crutches you're not gon na be able to weight-bear on that foot for six to eight weeks what we'll do is we'll advance your ambulating gradually based on how you heal and based on how you tolerate the procedure i know i have covered a lot of material quickly but this is really gon na be the best course of action for you to have a good outcome now do you have any questions come answers concerns before i have the nurse come in finish the paperwork and get you set up for your procedure which we are going to do tomorrow if you're agreeable to that [Patient] what about putting in a cast can i just stay in the cast[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] you could but what we found is the best outcome is aligning those bones with plates and screws to make sure that they heal properly so you have the best outcome possible [Patient] so if the surgery is going to be tomorrow when am i going to get my mri[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] so what what we will do is the good news is we have an outpatient mri facility downstairs and i'm going to send the order down and we'll get you your mri this afternoon [Patient] can i think about it and we have some time[SEP]","574":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hello , mrs . martinez . good to see you today .

[Patient Guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense . [Patient Guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wow . okay . [Patient Guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ? [Patient Guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel . [Patient Guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mhm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ? [Patient Guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] got you . okay . [Patient Guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] hmm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Chitchat][Doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ? [Patient Guest] only pepcid .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ? [Patient Guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ? [Patient Guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ? [Patient Guest] yes , that is correct . he did .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ? [Patient Guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that . [Patient Guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care . [Patient Guest] you're welcome .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ? [Patient Guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned . [Patient Guest] um , this is what she sent me , \" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . \" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ? [Patient Guest] correct . yep .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did . [Patient Guest] yes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ? [Patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .[SEP]","578":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Therapeutic History][Doctor] tyler nelson , date of birth : 3 , 6 , 1949 , mrn , 385729 . he is here today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis . last time he was here , he received a steroid injection in his right knee . hello mr. nelson , how are you ? [Patient] um , about the same as last time . my knee is still swollen .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] that was your right knee , correct ? i take it the injection did n't help ? [Patient] it did , maybe for a couple of weeks .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] that's it ? and is it still painful ? [Patient] yeah , it's pretty painful , and now the whole leg is getting swollen .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , what would you say your pain level is ? [Patient] i mean , right now it's about a 3 or so , but , typically on a normal day it's around 6 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , and its been swollen like that for how long now ? [Patient] since i was last here a couple weeks after that . so about , maybe two months now .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , but before it was just the knee ? [Patient] yeah , the whole thing was n't swollen like this , but i tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time , but it has n't been helping .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , okay , so that has n't been working for you ? [Patient] i mean , it helps to some degree , but it's still swollen , especially around the knee .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] hmm . has it been keeping you from doing things during the day ? [Patient] well , i slowed down a little bit , and i found a few things too fast . but when it really hurts , is when i've been sitting for a while , and then i have to try and get up . i'm so stiff getting up i have to use a cane to get my bearings . i mean , after a little bit , it loosens up , but that first getting up is real difficult .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yeah , i can see , that makes sense . have you been taking your medication regularly ? your on xeljanz right ? [Patient] yeah , the xr , i think its , uhm , 11 milligrams a day ? yeah , but i'm taking it everyday , and i'm also taking celebrex which i started maybe 2 months ago .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yes , the 200mgs daily . how's that working for you ? [Patient] pretty good , up until it started swelling again .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , well come sit over here , and if you could take of your socks and shoes , and we'll take a look at your knee . and just to let you know , i have a service now that writes my note about the visit , so you'll hear me call things out and describe what i see fully . [Patient] okay , gotcha .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] right , so let's check your leg . can you straighten it , and does it hurt ? [Patient] yeah , when i try to straighten it all the way it does .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , range of motion slightly diminished . i'm going to press here , okay ? and how about here , hmm , i see some pitting around the knee and ankle . normal capillary refill in the toes . does any of this area hurt ? [Patient] um , just kinda sore , like an old bruise ?[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] so , i can feel that the knee is hot , and that means there's something going on , like some inflammation . so we can give you another steroid injection for that . i also want to get an x-ray of that knee , so we can see where all the swelling is coming from . [Patient] yeah . let's do it . sounds go to me .[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Doctor] okay , and did we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ? [Patient] yeah , that was some years ago , but that was the other knee .[SEP][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . so i think we'll set that up for you now . we'll also do an x-ray on that knee . i can send you for a physical therapy , and if nothing is helping , then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee . [Patient] okay , sounds like a plan .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right , so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot . i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection . there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless . [Patient] okay . and that's a procedure you're going to do right now ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] yep . once we're done talking here , and as far as the edema in your legs , uh , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can do as well . the compression socks are a good start . um , and also , do you eat a lot of salt ? [Patient] i mean , um , i mean i love my salty snacks .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . well , salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling . you can also prop your feet up any time you get a chance , especially at night . and have you talked to your private care doctor about this at all ? [Patient] no , i figured i would just come here first .[SEP]","579":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi logan . how are you ?

[Patient] i'm doing okay , thank you .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed . [Patient] yeah , that would not be good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery . [Patient] yeah , that's right .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive .

[Patient] yeah , i , i'm pleased about it too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ? [Patient] yeah , i had leg cramps the other day , but i thought it might , was maybe just because i was cold as i had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep . i had cramps when i woke up in both legs right here . um i drank pickle juice and it went right away .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well do n't , do n't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it . [Patient] haha , i know , i only drink about 4 ounces or so .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay good . [Patient] um it went away so i did n't drink anymore . i find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] sure just , just keep it in moderation .

[Patient] good , that's a relief to hear .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results .

little worse after a meal[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] hmmm okay [Patient] in the morning before i've eaten it's it's not too bad but during the day after a meal it gets worse[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright and do you notice that pain radiates anywhere or moves you know any or anywhere [Patient] it's pretty low it might radiate a little bit to the left but otherwise it's pretty localized to the right side[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and have you had any nausea or vomiting along with the pain [Patient] i've had some nausea and a little bit of heartburn but no vomiting[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and and this is this is this is worse with you said worse worse with meals and is there anything else anything else that that makes it worse [Patient] it is a little tender if i if i press on it and certain positions seem to make it a little worse when i'm most when it's the highest[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay sure any pain with urination or any blood in your urine [Patient] no no urinary symptoms[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and how about any diarrhea and any of that or blood in your stool no [Patient] no change in bowels[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright and so would you say that your appetite has been normal or decreased or any different [Patient] well since i'm a little nauseated i'm not quite as hungry and i feel just kind of a little overall a little more fatigued over the last week[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay okay you did n't overeat you know during the super bowl last weekend did you that was i know probably lots of junk food floating around if your house is anything like mine [Patient] well once the packers are out of the playoffs i do n't watch the super bowl so nothing i have n't eaten anything unusual[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay well that's good that's good and and no no travel i know you're a big big travel travel fan you know i remember you telling me about your trip to europe last summer that sounded amazing have you been traveling outside of the country again recently [Patient] not recently just back to wisconsin but no unusual travel or other exposures[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright great and okay so so tell me about your migraines how have they been are you still taking the sumatriptan you know as needed when when you developed migraine you have have you had a migraine recently [Patient] i have not usually they are responsive to just excedrin migraine i use the sumatriptan when i need to if it if it does n't respond to the over the counter analgesic[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay okay great yeah you've learned a lot about it and and the treatments including the the term analgesic and all of that that's pretty impressive you've been you've been through the ringer i think with with those so okay and so you're taking excedrin when you get a migraine and then sort of would you say maybe for breakthrough migraines or worse migraines you'd take a sumatriptan occasionally [Patient] yeah[SEP]","588":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] so anna good to see you today so reading here in your appointment notes you were you were diagnosed with kidney stones from your your pcp and you currently have one and so they they had you come in so can you tell me what happened how's all that going for you [Patient] sure i've been having some back pain on my right side it's been lasting for about a week now[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so on the right side so does that pain does it move anywhere or is it just kinda stay in that that one area [Patient] yeah it's moved down a little bit on to my right lower side a little bit[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] side okay so how would you describe the pain is it constant or is does it come and go [Patient] it's pretty constant[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay did you notice any pain when you're urinating i know i know you say you you saw you see blood but any pain with that [Patient] no no real pain when i'm when i'm peeing at all[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so have you taken anything i know have you tried like azo or any of that to [Patient] i took some ibuprofen that helped a little bit[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] alright have you noticed any nausea vomiting fever chills [Patient] i have n't thrown up but i felt a little bit nauseated[SEP][Family History][Doctor] little nauseated yeah that's we expected so have you do you have a family history of kidney stones i know some people when they have them like their parents have them stuff but [Patient] yeah my my dad had kidney stones i think he has passed a couple of them i'm not quite sure[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] alright and have you had any in the past or is this your first one [Patient] this is my first time i've never had this before[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright so we'll do we'll do an exam on you just to check you out so i guess you were in pain and stuff over the over the easter easter break there that [Patient] yeah yeah i had some pain over the weekend i saw my pediatrician this morning so they sent me over here they were concerned that i might have a kidney stone[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay so i'm guessing you did n't get to go find the eggs on the easter egg hunt because of the you were in pain [Patient] not so much but i i got to participate a little bit i opened some eggs i just did n't go run around and find them[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay well i i'm lucky enough my friends had an adult easter hag hunt for me and so i was able to find a couple eggs yesterday myself so i i'm glad you were able to get a few of them alright so let's do that that physical exam on you so your vitals look good you do n't have any fever your blood pressure heart rate is fine so when i press here on your belly does that hurt [Patient] a little bit yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Reassessment][Doctor] a little bit alright so on your exam of your abdomen there is mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there's no rebound or guarding there is cva located near your flank tenderness on the right so that means that everything looks good but you do have what seems to be some inflammation of your kidney okay so we we were able to get a ct of your your side and it showed that you do have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size and it's located in the proximal right ureter and so that's that duck that passes from your kidney to your bladder alright i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so that means that there's not obstructing ureter causing swelling in your kidney which is which is pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone on the right so what i'm recommending is i want you to push fluids just to help facilitate you passing that stone alright have you been taking in have you been drinking enough water do you think so far [Patient] probably not enough i drink some but[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay yeah i i want you to to drink try drink as much as possible just to see if we can get you hydrated and pass the stone what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na prescribe you ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you can take that as needed for pain i know you said you were in that much pain just in case it does start to move you're in pain i want you to take the ibuprofen i'm also gon na give you a strainer for you to strain your pee so we can see you wan na know when that that stone does pass gon na order a bmp and a urinalysis and a urine culture and based on what the urinalysis shows we can decide if i can decide if i need to put you on antibiotics if you do have an infection of some kind and i wan na see you back in about a week to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we can discuss further treatment such as a lithotripsy and it's it's a mainly minimally invasive procedure where we use shock waves to try to break up that stone but otherwise do you have any other questions for me [Patient] no i do n't think so[SEP]","589":"[Conversation Start][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] . next patient is michelle king . date of birth : 05\/07\/1982 . please use toc template . she was admitted to district regional hospital on 06\/29\/2021 , and was discharged on 07\/02\/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to , uh , prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ? [Patient] not too bad . and yourself ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ? [Patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on . [Patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high . [Patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] typically , it does n't . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive . [Patient] yeah , that's what they said .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ... [Patient] hm .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] uh , they did n't do a ct scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ? [Patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in . [Patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , maybe that's all it was . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ? [Patient] yes , i am .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] great . so here are my thoughts . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ? [Patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ? [Patient] sure , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see . [Patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing . [Patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ? [Patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ? [Patient] i am unvaccinated .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ? [Patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] correct , we do n't . [Patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as \" vaccine injury \" .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] right . [Patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that . [Patient] all of them ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ? [Patient] no , i do n't .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint . [Patient] well , i am open-minded to this .[SEP]","590":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] good morning carolyn how are you [Patient] i'm doing alright other than this ankle pain i've been having[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so i see here that you hurt your right ankle can you tell me what happened [Patient] yeah so yesterday i was going to take out the trash and it was quite icy i thought i was doing okay job and i just slipped and and fell and i'm pretty sure i heard a pop[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and you said this happened yesterday correct [Patient] yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and have you been able to walk on it at all [Patient] no i was so initially when i first fell i was unable to walk at on it at all i had a friend that was visiting and so she heard me fall so she helped me inside now today i have been able to put a little bit more weight on it but i'm still limping[SEP]","591":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , james , how are you ?

[Patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . [Patient] okay . i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? [Patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?

[Patient Guest] we're okay , thank you .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] that's good to hear . so , how many days has randy been feeling sick ?

[Patient Guest] you know , he also , he's also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and , any fever you've noticed ? [Patient Guest] i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ? [Patient Guest] yes , he did . yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] and how about this morning ? did he eat his breakfast ? [Patient Guest] uh , this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] and then he got another bottle , and he barely ate that . um , i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] so , he varies i guess .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps , or does he have pretty good energy ? [Patient Guest] mmm , it seems like he's irritable .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] irritable because he is n't feeling good ? [Patient Guest] yeah . he is energetic , but it seems like he ca n't go to sleep , like , he's fighting it really hard .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay , and just for the chart , is there anyone , anybody else exposed to him who has been sick ? [Patient Guest] yes , his older sister's been sick .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] thank you . [Patient Guest] we also had a play date with my nephew , who i learned later had a sinus infection .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and what medication have you tried for him ? anything at all ? [Patient Guest] um , i've been doing the saline mist in his nose .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] good , good . that's a good choice . [Patient Guest] i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him , and we had the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i see . and , any other medications ? [Patient Guest] we did put some baby vick's on his feet last night to try and help him breathe . and , i also used the humidifier .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . that's good . [Patient Guest] okay . okay .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ? [Patient Guest] i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] is it a dandruff shampoo ? [Patient Guest] no , i do n't think so .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps . [Patient Guest] okay , sounds good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] can you take a big breath randy . [Patient Guest] where's mama ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too .

[Patient Guest] all right . thank you .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine . you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well . [Patient Guest] okay . okay .[SEP]","600":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , andrew . how are you ?

[Patient] hi , doc . nice to meet you .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] i was just reviewing your records from dr. howard and he's referred you because the workup for headaches revealed a mass on your pituitary gland . i did review your mri images and you have a significant mass there . can you tell me about the issues you've been experiencing ? [Patient] yeah sure . so i'm really getting fed up with these headaches . i've been trying my best to deal with them but they've been going on for months now and i'm really struggling .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] where are the headaches located and how would you describe that pain ? [Patient] located behind my eyes . it's like a dull nagging ache .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . was the onset gradual or sudden ? [Patient] well it started about three months ago . and they've been getting worse over time . at first it was like three out of 10 severity , and it just gradually worsened . and now it's about six out of 10 severity . the headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and it feels like a dull ache behind the eyes . they last a few hours at a time , nothing makes them better or worse .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . can you tell me if the pain radiates , or if you have any other symptoms ? specifically feeling sick , fever , rashes , neck stiffness , numbness , weakness , passing out ? [Patient] no . i have n't been sick or felt sick . ca n't recall a fever or any kind of rash . no- no neck issues , no numbness , no tingling . and i've never passed out in my life . but , um , for some reason recently i seem to be bumping into door frames .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . have you noticed any change in your vision or with your balance ? [Patient] no i do n't think so . my eyes were checked in the fall .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] okay . let's see , do you have any other medical problems that you take medicine for ? [Patient] no i do n't have any medical problems and i do n't take any medicines . i tried tylenol a few times for the headaches but it did n't work , so i stopped .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] i see . anyone in your family have any history of diseases ? [Patient] i was adopted so i really have no idea .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . um , what kind of work do you do ? and are you married ? [Patient] i work as a computer programmer and i've been married for 25 years . we just bought a small house .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] that's nice . um , do you drink any alcohol , smoke , or use recreational drugs ? [Patient] nope . i do n't do any of those and never have .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . um , well let me take a good look at you . um , now you'll hear me calling out some details as i perform the examination . these will be noted for me in your record and i'll be happy to answer any questions you have once we're done . [Patient] sounds good , doc .[SEP][Physical Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] all right . the patient is alert , oriented to time , place , and person . affect is appropriate and speech is fluent . cranial nerve examination is grossly intact . no focal , motor , or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities . visual acuity and eye movements are normal . pupils are equal and reactive . visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia . and color vision is normal . all right , mr. ward . i'm going to review these pictures from the mri with you . um , now this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma , but there's no way to be sure without sending the removed adenoma to pathology to make the diagnosis , which we will do . um , here you can see it's a well defined mass . and it's pressing right here on what we call the optic chiasm . and today when i was having you look at my fingers , you could n't see them off to the sides , that's what we call bitemporal hemianopia . and explains why you have been bumping into door frames . [Patient] yeah i never noticed that i could n't see out of the side until you did that test , and you closed one eye with both eyes . i really could n't tell .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] no because you're having this vision loss from the mass compressing the optic chiasm , the only option we have is to do surgery . [Patient] okay , i understand . do you think i'll regain my vision ?[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Referral][Other Treatments][Doctor] well there's no guarantees , but it is a possibility . i'm gon na refer you to the eye doctor for a full exam and they'll do what's called visual field test . this will map our your peripheral vision or side vision prior to surgery . and we can monitor after surgery to see if your vision is improving . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and let's discuss the surgery a little more . um , we would do what's called a transsphenoidal approach to do the surgery . this is minimally invasive and we go through the sphenoid sinus . there are some risks i have to inform you of . uh , risk of anesthesia including but not limited to the risk of heart attack , stroke , and death . risk of surgery include infection , need for further surgery , wound issues such as spinal fluid leak or infection , uh , which may require long , prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure . uh , seizure , stroke , permanent numbness , weakness , difficulty speaking , or even death . [Patient] well i guess we have to do it regardless .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . so i will have you see our surgery scheduler , deborah , on the way out to get you set up . we will get this scheduled fairly quickly so i do n't want you to be alarmed . um , she'll also get you set up today or tomorrow to have the visual field test and you may not be able to see the eye doctor until after surgery . but we have the pre-surgery visual field test for comparison after surgery . [Patient] okay . i look forward to these headaches going away . i never thought it could be something like this going on .[SEP]","603":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey matthew how're you doing [Patient] hey doc i'm doing pretty good how are you[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] i'm doing pretty good hey i see here in the nurse's notes it looks like you hurt your left ankle can you tell me a little bit more about that [Patient] yeah i did my wife and i were on a walk yesterday and i was just talking to her and and stepped off the curb and landed on it wrong it's kind of embarrassing but yeah it's been killing me for a couple days now[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay now when you fell did you feel or hear a pop or anything like that [Patient] i would n't say i really heard a pop it was just kind of really kind of felt extended and stretched and it it's just been really bothering me ever since kind of on the outside of it[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then were you able to walk on it after the incident [Patient] i was able to get back to the house because i did n't wan na you know make my wife carry me but it was it was painful[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and then have you done any or had any injuries to that ankle before [Patient] nothing substantial that i would say in the past[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and then what have you been doing for that left ankle since then have you done anything to help make it make the pain less [Patient] i have taken some ibuprofen and then i just tried to elevate it and ice it a little bit and keep my weight off of it[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so let's talk real quick about your pain level zero being none ten being the worst pain you've been in in your life without any medication on board can you rate your pain for me [Patient] i would say it's about an eight[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then when you do take that ibuprofen or tylenol what what's your relief level what's your pain look like then [Patient] maybe a seven it it's a little[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay now you mentioned going for a walk my wife and i've been on on back behind the new rex center where the new trails are have you guys been back there [Patient] we have n't yet but i'm sure we'll check it out ever since i feel like working at home during covid we we we take walks all the time[SEP]","604":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , ms. brooks . i'm dr. baker . how are you ?

[Patient] yes .[SEP][Physical Examination][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] all right . so , on exam , you do have some tenderness over your distal phalanx , which is the tip of your finger . there is , uh , some tenderness over that joint itself . i do n't feel any tenderness over your proximal joint or your metacarpophalangeal joint , which is right above your knuckle . uh , you have some pain flexion as well . so , let's look at your x-rays . hey , dragon , show me the x-rays . all right . so , on this x-ray.everything looks normal right now . uh , i do n't see any fractures . everything lines up pretty well . uh , so , your x-ray looks normal with no fractures . so , based on the x-ray and your exam , you have some tenderness right here . i think you've got a little contusion right here . there's no fracture on the tip of your finger . uh , so , the diagnosis would be a right hand , uh , index finger contusion on the tip of your finger , okay ? so , i would recommend we get you a s- uh , aluminum foam splint and we'll get you some motrin . uh , we'll give you 600 milligrams every six hours and we'll take that for about a week . and if it does n't get better , why do n't you call us and come back at that point ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . do you have any questions ? [Patient] no . i think that sounds good .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . hey , dragon , order the medication and procedures we discussed . all right . and why do n't you come with me and we'll get you signed out .

but it can go down a bit into my forearm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then do you remember any trauma did you hit your arm or elbow or any on anything [Patient] no nothing i i really was trying to think if there is anything else and i ca n't think of anything[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and you've never injured that right elbow before [Patient] no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright so now let's talk a little bit about your pain and how bad it how bad is that pain on a scale from zero to ten ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life [Patient] i would say probably a six[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and does that pain keep you up at night [Patient] it does[SEP]","607":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey dylan what's going

Socials][Doctor] did you play any sports when you were younger [Patient] no anything you can think of primarily it was basketball baseball and football[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and did your elbows hurt at that time or is this a a new injury [Patient] it's new[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] when did it start [Patient] probably year and a half ago[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay on both elbows about a year and a half ago [Patient] yeah[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain [Patient] ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams three times a day[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and does anything make it better or worse [Patient] the more i use my hands or my arms the more it hurts[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you tried icing [Patient] yes[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] does that give you any relief [Patient] no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright is it the inside or outside of your elbows [Patient] inside[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] inside okay let's just do a quick physical exam here i'll take a look at your right elbow first [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] if i bend it this way up does it hurt it's your left does that hurt [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] how about this [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so pain with both flexion and extension [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] looks like you have little bit of limited range of motion on extension not on flexion though you said it hurts right here on the inside of your elbow [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so pain on the medial side with palpation [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright how about the outside [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] no pain with palpation outside of the elbow you have do you have normal sensation in your fingers [Patient] i think so[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay great [Patient] good to go[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] sensation is normal to the touch [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] pulses equal in all extremities how about the left elbow same thing if i bend it this way does that hurt [Patient] not as much[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] how about this way [Patient] not as much[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so little bit of pain on flexion and extension little bit of limited range of motion on extension of the arm how about if you twist like you're opening a door [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so some pain with torsion and twisting supination what about pronation [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] no pain with pronation on the right side [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] same thing on the left [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] pain with supination no pain with pronation [Patient] correct[SEP][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] alright so dylan it took some x-rays coming in looks like you do n't have any any fractures or any bony misalignment which i expect with this kind of injury i do think that what you have is medial epicondylitis which is [Patient] is that golfer's elbow[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yes same thing have you been golfing a lot [Patient] well not in the past year and a half i've had this for a long time[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay also known as pictures elbow [Patient] well i have n't been pitching either[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] hmmm well in any case what i'm gon na have to do is i'm gon na send you up for mri to take another look at this [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] that will be our next step so we'll get you scheduled for the mri probably get you in pretty quick here since we're a private practice [Patient] thank god[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah and once you get the mri i'll know a little bit more what i'd like to do is something called a whole blood transfusion have you heard of that before [Patient] no please tell me remind me[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah it should help with the healing of your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow [Patient] you do a stick needle in my elbow[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow [Patient] so it's kinda like dry needling then[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] what is it [Patient] is it is that that thing where like you take the blood out of like say my my thigh[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] and then you literally inject it into my tendon[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah that's exactly what it is [Patient] interesting cool[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so hopefully i mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this [Patient] i'm excited[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks it's not not a major procedure and you should heal in the next two weeks so that wo n't be a problem especially considering that you're expecting a newborn soon we want to make sure you're all healed for that [Patient] wow i did n't even say that[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i read it in your chart [Patient] man you doctors are good[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah anything else going on today [Patient] just trying to figure out how you're doing[SEP]","608":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hi virginia how are you today what brings you in [Patient] i'm doing alright i started seeing this new pcp last year and you know she has been doing a lot of changes to my medication and making sure everything is up to date and she my noticed that my blood pressure has been quite high so she added to medications but and but i you know i've been taking them i've been really good and i i before i was n't but now i am and we're still having a hard time controlling my blood pressure so she thought it would be a good idea for me to see you especially since she noted some on my last blood work she said something about my kidneys[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay yeah so okay let's before i dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling [Patient] i would say you know most of the days i feel fine i'm still busy at work i definitely can tell though when my blood pressure is high[SEP]","609":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Therapeutic History][Doctor] next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation . hi emily , how are you ? [Patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ? [Patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's the 250\/50 dose , correct ? [Patient] yes , correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ? [Patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ? [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ? [Patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ? [Patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no kidding , that's great . [Patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] really ? [Patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ? [Patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ? [Patient] probably about three or four .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ? [Patient] yes , that's correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ? [Patient] i do .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then . [Patient] nope .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ? [Patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ? [Patient] correct .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ? [Patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ? [Patient] yeah , that's right .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ? [Patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ? [Patient] yeah , it does , it works great .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ? [Patient] yep , that's correct .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ? [Patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it . [Patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ? [Patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment . [Patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point . [Patient] all right , that sounds good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh . [Patient] ahh .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good . [Patient] awesome .[SEP][Physical Examination][Personal History][Doctor] so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ? [Patient] i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ? [Patient] correct .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use . [Patient] yeah i do know that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med . [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] that we had too much , yeah . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco . [Patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day . [Patient] all right[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you . [Patient] okay , got it .[SEP][Follow-up][Doctor] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ? [Patient] yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well . [Patient] awesome , thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ? [Patient] i just get it over the counter .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay got it . and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ? [Patient] i do n't think i need any refills , i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis , or there was few select times when i had to use it when i was kid .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay good . well i think we have our game plan . [Patient] okay awesome .[SEP][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] and do the alvesco two puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it . the zyrtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen . [Patient] okay[SEP]","610":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] elizabeth , how are you ?

[Patient] so i've been going to therapy once a week for the past year . um , mostly virtually , um , but starting to get in-person . virtual was a bit of a struggle , but i feel like being in-person with someone really helps me .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and do y- do you have a good support system at home ? [Patient] yes , i do . i have my husband and , uh , my kids are right down the street from me , so i'm very lucky .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . all right . so that's good to hear . how about your blood pressure ? did you buy the blood pressure cuff that i- [Patient] yes .[SEP][Physical Examination][Personal History][Doctor] . told you to ? okay . i know that we've been in communication and your blood pressures have been running okay . the last time i spoke with you , how are they doing since we last spoke ?

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . so on physical examination , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits in your neck . on your heart exam i do notice a slight 2\/6 systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past , so i think that's stable . your lungs in- are nice and clear , and you have some trace lower extremity edema bilaterally , so all that means is , you know , i agree , you know , maybe we should watch your diet a little bit better , okay ? but i wan na take a look at some of your results , okay ?

[Patient] yeah . they said they did n't really see anything on the scan .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] yes , i agree . it looked normal . [Patient] the problem is i'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] is the pain there all the time ? [Patient] it's a nagging feeling and it just depends . sometimes it bothers me , sometimes it does n't .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] has this been the case over the past two years as well ?

[Patient] about three to four times a week . it's like when i need to go to the bathroom , if i can massage it , it feels like it's moving some and i can eventually go .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and when you have a bowel movement , does the pain change ?

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants . [Patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain . [Patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ? [Patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ? [Patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ? [Patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ? [Patient] i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ?

[Patient] no .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice . [Patient] what would cause that ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted . [Patient] that's good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly . [Patient] what's that ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon . [Patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?[SEP]","613":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] alright julia so you've been coming to see me

Examination][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] you are okay alright now i wan na go ahead and just move on to a quick physical exam okay i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay alright i do have to do a rectal exam i apologize i'm just gon na be calling it out what what i what i appreciate okay so on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur hurt at the left base on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your abdominal exam your abdomen is nontender and nondistended i do n't appreciate any masses or any rebound or guarding on your prostate exam i do appreciate an enlarged prostate i do n't appreciate any masses on physical exam so what what does that mean billy so that ultimately means that you know everything looks good you know you have that little heart murmur which i believe you you've had in the past but we're gon na go ahead and look into that you know your prostate seems a little bit enlarged to me on physical exam so let's talk about how we can go about and and remedy that okay so for your first problem of this you know difficulty urinating i wan na go ahead and just order some routine labs i wan na get a a psa that kind of that ultimately kinda looks for prostate cancer issues which i do n't think you have because we did n't really appreciate that on physical exam i wan na go ahead and we can try to start you on what we call flomax zero point four milligrams once a day you should take it at night because it can cause people to get a little bit dizzy if they take it in the morning so i would take it at night and i wan na go ahead and refer you to a urologist just to look into this more so we can go ahead and and get this problem solved for you okay i'm also gon na go ahead and just order some routine blood tests just to make sure that we are not missing anything do you have any questions about that and i wan na go ahead and order a urinalysis and a urine culture [Patient] yeah so sounds good have you seen that commercial for that super batter prostate stuff does that work[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] well i think the data it's it's i'm not really sure if it works or not i'm not that familiar with it let's just go ahead and stick with flomax and that's why we are gon na refer you to the urologist so that they can go ahead and talk to you about you know the most current treatment options for you okay [Patient] alright[SEP]","618":"[Conversation

[Patient Guest] well , he started to get a runny nose .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , and is he stuffy too ? [Patient Guest] yeah . yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , and have you noticed , is his mucous clear right now ?

[Patient Guest] well , i know he's been pulling on his ears , yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] you know , he also , he's also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and , any fever you've noticed ? [Patient Guest] i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ? [Patient Guest] yes , he did . yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] and how about this morning ? did he eat his breakfast ? [Patient Guest] uh , this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] and then he got another bottle , and he barely ate that . um , i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] so , he varies i guess .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps , or does he have pretty good energy ? [Patient Guest] mmm , it seems like he's irritable .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] irritable because he is n't feeling good ? [Patient Guest] yeah . he is energetic , but it seems like he ca n't go to sleep , like , he's fighting it really hard .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay , and just for the chart , is there anyone , anybody else exposed to him who has been sick ? [Patient Guest] yes , his older sister's been sick .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] thank you . [Patient Guest] we also had a play date with my nephew , who i learned later had a sinus infection .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and what medication have you tried for him ? anything at all ? [Patient Guest] um , i've been doing the saline mist in his nose .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] good , good . that's a good choice . [Patient Guest] i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him , and we had the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i see . and , any other medications ? [Patient Guest] we did put some baby vick's on his feet last night to try and help him breathe . and , i also used the humidifier .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . that's good . [Patient Guest] okay . okay .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ? [Patient Guest] i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] is it a dandruff shampoo ? [Patient Guest] no , i do n't think so .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps . [Patient Guest] okay , sounds good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] can you take a big breath randy . [Patient Guest] where's mama ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too . [Patient Guest] yeah , it's okay buddy .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over . [Patient Guest] dino , you're doing so good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down . [Patient Guest] hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like . [Patient Guest] all right . thank you .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine . you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well . [Patient Guest] okay . okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough . [Patient Guest] mm-hmm , got it .[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough . [Patient Guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine .

champ in high school or something [Patient] yeah yeah that was a hundred years ago i ca n't i i try to play like that and i ca n't i ca n't do that anymore but yeah a good memory that's a that's a good memory[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i did i did yeah that was that was crazy that was a great tournament what a what a finish unbelievable [Patient] yeah hey did you see the masters i know you're a golfer[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah yeah yeah i do n't get out as often as i as as i like to but but the masters yeah that was that was amazing that was lot of fun to lot of fun did you catch it too [Patient] i did[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yep yep agreed agreed and so well listen we'll we'll hopefully get you feeling better here and get you back out on the court and out on the course and we'll talk about that but let's let me ask you about your diabetes a little bit a little bit here so how have your blood sugars been running mark have they been what in the low one hundreds two hundreds where are they [Patient] they are like one fifty one sixty you know we just had easter and my kids got a whole bunch of candies so i keep eating that[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] hmmm okay yeah yeah understood so those cadboy eggs they'll get you every time too right [Patient] yes[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] boy my gosh yeah those are the best so those are those are deadly do n't tell my cardiologist so okay so listen you know i see that we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams once a day no actually last visit we increased it so i've got you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day correct you're still taking that [Patient] yes twice a day[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and but your blood sugars are a bit off you know maybe those the cadberry eggs so how about your asthma how has that been doing you know have you had any asthma attacks you're still taking flovent twice a day and the albuterol as needed [Patient] yeah knock on wood i my asthma is pretty much under control[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay excellent excellent alright and i recall you know just kinda review a few things i i think you've got an allergy to penicillin is that correct [Patient] that's correct yes[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and then you you know your surgical history you had your your gallbladder out what about ten years ago i think by doctor nelson correct [Patient] yes that's right[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay and then let's go ahead and examine you alright so mark your exam is pretty much you know for the most part normal with a few exceptions on your heart exam you still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur and that's unchanged from prior exam we're watching that and so that just means i hear some some heart sounds as your heart is beating there i'm not too concerned about it as as that's not changed otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and your physical exam otherwise on your musculoskeletal exam on your right elbow you do have moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness of the right elbow and how about when i move this when i move your elbow like this does that hurt you [Patient] kills[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay sorry about that so you've got moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow there is no palpable joint effusion and now what if i press against your wrist like so does that hurt you [Patient] yeah it hurts a little bit[SEP][Personal History][Radiology Examination][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright sorry so that's you have mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist as well okay otherwise normal unremarkable exam and let's talk about your results now so your right elbow x-ray today shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality so that's good there's no malalignment or sign of joint effusion and otherwise it's a normal right elbow x-ray so that's reassuring okay and hey you know i meant to ask you you know and do you have any history of fever recently you know along with the elbow pain you had noticed a fever [Patient] no i do n't think so[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Medication][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay great excellent alright so tell you what let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan here so for your first problem my assessment is is that you have acute lateral epicondylitis of your right elbow and this is also known as tennis elbow go figure right so this is due to overuse likely the increase in your your tennis activity which normally would be good but maybe we're overdoing it a little bit so i have a few recommendations i'd like you to rest your right arm as much as you can i want you to stop tennis for the next four to six weeks and please avoid repetitive stress in that right arm as well i want you to ice that right elbow for twenty minutes at least three times per day and this should reduce the pain and inflammation and then i'm also going to give you a brace for your right forearm and my nurse will give this to you before you leave that should help with the discomfort okay in that right elbow i will also write you a prescription for ultram and this should help with the pain i'll write you a prescription ultram fifty milligrams once per day that should help with your elbow pain so then i wan na see you in follow-up in four weeks and so we'll reevaluate your elbow at that time and if you we'll consider some additional imaging if needed possibly a physical therapy referral depending on how you're doing mkay now for your second problem of diabetes type two my assessment is is that your blood sugar is a little bit out of control mkay so we need to make some adjustments i'm going to increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice per day and i want you to check your blood sugar twice daily for the next two weeks and then let me know how your blood sugar is running and we can make some additional adjustments if needed but i will increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice a day now i'm going to also order a hemoglobin a1c level and and a cbc blood test today and and so we'll check those results the hemoglobin a1c and the cbc and then i'm going to also check a chem-12 blood test as well and now for your third problem of the mild acute intermittent asthma you my assessment is that it really remains under good control so let's keep you on that flovent and the albuterol no changes there and you can use those as tolerated it does look like you need a refill on your albuterol so i'm gon na write you a prescription for a refill of the albuterol and you can pick that up at your pharmacy as well so how does that all sound any questions for me [Patient] it sounds pretty good i ca n't believe it's just tennis elbow feel like a looser coming in here but it's okay i get it[SEP]","629":"[Conversation

Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey matthew i see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your pcp sent you over to see me how're you doing today [Patient] pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there [Patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version [Patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at [Patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes [Patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me [Patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life [Patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better [Patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs [Patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] that's okay [Patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day[SEP]","634":"[Conversation

[Patient] ow , .[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that . [Patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you . [Patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two .

catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [Patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [Patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [Patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [Patient] yes yes that's the name of it[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [Patient] i would say like almost everyday i

well[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [Patient] it does[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [Patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to

throughout[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Referral][Radiology Examination][Medication][Doctor] okay alright well looking at your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever your blood pressure looks quite good it's about one twenty two over seventy six your heart rate is appropriate at eighty two beats per minute and your oxygenation is ninety five percent on room air on your cervical spine exam there is no tenderness to palpation of the cervical spine there is full range of motion on head exam there does not appear to be any trauma there is no ecchymosis or bruising on the right shoulder exam on your musculoskeletal exam there is pain to palpation of the posterior shoulder at the acromioclavicular joint there is decreased abduction and adduction to about ninety degrees only there is there is a he has pain with supination and pronation of the right arm and there is a palpable radial radial artery pulse okay so what does that mean that just means that you have some you know evidence of the injury there and we'll we're gon na talk about that so i had the nurse do a shoulder x-ray on you before i came in the room and the results of your right shoulder x-ray showed that you have an acute acromioclavicular joint fracture so you just have a a a small fracture of the acromion i do n't think that it it's gon na be anything that we need to do surgery for so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your right shoulder injury for your acute acromioclavicular joint fracture i wan na go ahead and just put you in a sling for now i wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i wan na go ahead and just order a cat scan of your right shoulder just to kinda get a better look of how the joint looks and we're gon na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to strengthen your shoulder in hopes of avoiding surgery in the future how does that sound [Patient] yeah that that sounds great just being able to take a little bit of something for the pain would would would be really appreciated[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay do you think you need something stronger than meloxicam [Patient] no i'll give that a shot[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay any questions [Patient] when can i get back out on the field[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] well you ca n't play taggle football for a while

also have been renovating my basement so i have been doing a lot with that[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] wow okay and do you know if there was any direct or associated trauma that you can think of over the past three weeks like did you fall or hit your shoulder or anything [Patient] no no trauma that i can think of at all[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay now have you ever had pain in that shoulder before [Patient] you know i'm active and will have aches and pains here and there but nothing that some tylenol ca n't take care of[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and and it's isolated to your left shoulder [Patient] it is[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay are you able to move that left arm for me [Patient] you know anytime i try reaching for something or lifting anything i have a lot of pain and i do n't even try to raise my arm over my head because that's it it really hurts[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so now i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain are you having pain all of the time or does it wax and wane does it come and go [Patient] it's all the time and if there is any pressure like when i try to sleep at night i ca n't even lay i'm a side sleeper and it i really gives me a hard time because i'm so uncomfortable so the pain is always there[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so you ca n't lay on your left side at all [Patient] i ca n't[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright now do you have that pain when you lay on your back as well or just on your left side [Patient] i mean it's always there but when i sleep directly on it the pain goes up[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay now let's talk just briefly about your pain so if you have n't taken anything at all or have you been taking anything at all let's start with that have you been taking anything for the pain [Patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol and i'll take two extra strengths tylenol every six to eight hours[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay that's good now without any tylenol what's your pain level [Patient] without any tylenol i would say my pain is like a three[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and then with tylenol with that [Patient] i'm sorry i keep doing that without any tylenol my pain is like a seven and with tylenol it goes down to a two or three[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay that's good so the tylenol really does help you that that's a good thing [Patient] yeah[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] so you talked about renovating your basement did you guys just move in or is it just time for a little house facelift [Patient] yeah it just time we've been living in this house for some time now and you know with the pandemic we've been home and so decided to do some work[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] nice have you been into the new home depot that they just opened down the street here [Patient] no[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah it's nice my wife and i were there this weekend and they just opened two weeks ago so everything's fully stocked and if you guys are doing some renovations you might run down there and you know save big money at home depot [Patient] i definitely will check that out[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] so are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your arm or hand [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Radiology Examination][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay so if you do n't mind i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam i've reviewed your vitals everything looks good there and i'm gon na do a focused exam of your left shoulder now you have limited active and passive range of motion there is some tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus and there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or clavicular joints and you have good hand grip bilaterally neurovascular exam of your left arm your cap refill is brisk in less than three seconds and motor and sensation is intact to light touch now for review of your x-ray of that left shoulder the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality so let me talk to you briefly about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy this means that the tendons of the muscles of that left shoulder have been injured and the injury happened to the tendons that make up or attach to the shoulder muscles i'm gon na go ahead and order an mri of your shoulder just to make sure nothing else is going on with that left shoulder i'm also going to go ahead and refer you for physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks okay now during that time i want you to continue to take tylenol p.r.n . if your symptoms do n't improve we can then consider maybe like a steroid injection of that left shoulder which could hopefully get you some relief now do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan [Patient] yeah so i'm really active so do you think that this pain will ever go away[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i do i do believe that that pain is gon na go away many of my patients are successful with pt so we are gon na start with that take a conservative approach and see how you do [Patient] okay alright[SEP][Follow-up][Doctor] alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you some paperwork and i'll see you in about two about two weeks [Patient] alright thank you[SEP]","645":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi wayne how're you today [Patient] i'm doing okay aside from this left shoulder pain that i've been having[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and how long have you had this pain [Patient] about i want to say a few weeks i think it's been about three weeks now[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and do you remember what you were doing when the pain started [Patient] honestly i've been trying to recall if i had any specific injury and i ca n't think of that[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright tell me have you ever had pain in that shoulder before [Patient] you know i i'm really active and so i i will get some aches and pains here and there but nothing that tylenol ca n't take care of[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay good but now are you able to move your arm [Patient] you know i have trouble when i'm trying to reach for something or lift any objects and i do n't even try to reach it for anything over my head because then it'll really hurt[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright and and now are you having the pain all the time or does it come and go [Patient] the pain is always there and then it gets worse like if i try to put any pressure on it it gets worse so if i'm laying at night if i try to even lay on that shoulder it's unbearable[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and then tell me what have you taken for your pain [Patient] i've been taking two extra strength tylenol every six to eight hours[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] alright and and did that help [Patient] it does take the edge off but i still have some pain[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay well i'm sorry to hear that you know you know renovating the basement it can be quite a task and it can take a toll on you [Patient] yeah i mean it's been fun but yeah i think it really did take a toll on me[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah what what are you doing with your basement are you are you doing like a a man cave or [Patient] yeah yeah that's exactly right[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] that is awesome great well that sounds like fun i hope you get to set it up just the way you you would like for your man cave to be so congratulations to you there so tell me have you experienced any kind of numbness in your arms or in your hands [Patient] no no numbness or tingling[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright so let's just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here i did review your vitals everything here looks good now lem me take a look at your shoulder alright now on your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion and how does that feel here [Patient] that hurts[SEP][Physical Examination][Radiology Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay sorry there is tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus but there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints you have good hand grips alright and then now on your neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is intact to light touch alright so what does that all mean well firstly lem me go ahead and take a look at your results of your shoulder x-ray here now i reviewed the results and there are no fractures so that's good so let's go ahead and talk about my assessment and plan here wayne so for your problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured the tendons of the muscles that help make up your shoulder muscles so i will be ordering an mri for your left shoulder to be sure that there is nothing else going on with your shoulder okay [Patient] okay[SEP]","646":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] karen nelson is a 3 -year-old female

[Patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad . [Patient] yes , that's correct .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ? [Patient] yeah , that sounds good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today . [Patient Guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense . [Patient Guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wow . okay . [Patient Guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ? [Patient Guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel . [Patient Guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mhm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ? [Patient Guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] got you . okay . [Patient Guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] hmm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Chitchat][Doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ? [Patient Guest] only pepcid .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ? [Patient Guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ? [Patient Guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ? [Patient Guest] yes , that is correct . he did .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ? [Patient Guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that . [Patient Guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care . [Patient Guest] you're welcome .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ? [Patient Guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned . [Patient Guest] um , this is what she sent me , \" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . \" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ? [Patient Guest] correct . yep .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did . [Patient Guest] yes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?

trauma did you hit your arm or elbow or any on anything [Patient] no nothing i i really was trying to think if there is anything else and i ca n't think of anything[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and you've never injured that right elbow before [Patient] no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright so now let's talk a little bit about your pain and how bad it how bad is that pain on a scale from zero to ten ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life [Patient] i would say probably a six[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and does that pain keep you up at night [Patient] it does[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay and when you have that kind of pain does it keep you from doing other type of activities [Patient] yeah i mean i still try to like work through with using my arm

days now[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] alright and anything you've done to help relieve or alleviate that pain any anything that that's giving you relief [Patient] i've tried ibuprofen that helps a little but not much[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam your vitals look good and i'm gon na do a focused exam on that right elbow i'm gon na go ahead and and and press here do you do you have any pain when i press here [Patient] yes i do[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so you are positive for pain to palpation you do note that moderate tenderness of the medial epicondyle now i'm gon na have you turn your wrist as if you're turning a door knob do you have any pain when you do that [Patient] not really[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay now turn your wrist in so do you have any pain when you do that [Patient] yeah that hurts[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so you do have pain you were positive for pain when you pronate that that that forearm okay i'm gon na go ahead and have you rest your arm on the table here palm side up now i want you to raise your hand by bending at the wrist and i'm gon na put some resistance against it do you have any pain when i press against your flexed wrist [Patient] yes i do[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] alright so you are positive for pain with resistance against flexion of that left wrist so i let let's go ahead and review the x-ray that we did of your elbow the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality of that right elbow which is good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for the problem with elbow pain i do believe that this is consistent with medial epicondylitis which is caused by the overuse and potential damage of those tendons that bend that that bend the wrist towards the palm now i want you to rest it i'm gon na order a sling and i want you to wear the sling while you're awake now we're also gon na have you apply ice to the elbow for twenty minutes three times a day and i want you to take ibuprofen that's gon na be six hundred milligrams q.6 h. with food and i want you to take that for a full week now you're not gon na like this part but i want you to hold off for the next couple of

with her mother for acne located on the face , which started about two years ago and is present most every day . she has been using persa-gel and washing regularly , which is somewhat helpful . there are no associated symptoms including itching , bleeding , or pain . no additional past medical history . she lives with her parents and sister . they have a dog , bird , and bunnies . she is in 7th grade . she plays basketball and volleyball and tap . she wears sunscreen in the summer , spf 30 . no additional family history . hi kayla , i'm dr. juan price . i hear you are starting to get some acne on the face . how about the chest and back ? [Patient] it's not too bad .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so , it's not bad on the chest or back . you've used some over the counter items like washes and persa-gel ? [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] do those seem to be helping ? [Patient] yes , i think so , a little bit .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] good . what's your skin care routine like now ? [Patient] do you wan na know , like , the things i currently use ?[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yes . what do you do for your acne in the morning ? and then what do you do at nighttime ? [Patient] i wash my face , more like i wipe it down in the morning . then at night i use an elf facial cleanser called the super clarity cleanser . i finish with a toner and then the persa-gel .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] when you say , \" wipe your face in the morning , \" do you use a product or just water ? [Patient] mm , just water and a washcloth , really . if i feel really greasy , sometimes i'll use the elf cleanser in the morning , too .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and is today a good day , bad day , or an average day for you ? [Patient] mm , i would say it's probably a good day for me , of course , since i'm here , right ?[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] acne is always good when you come to see the doctor . do you find that your acne flares with your periods ? [Patient] no , not really .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] and do you get a regular period ? [Patient] yup .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] how long have you been getting a regular period ? [Patient] mm , i think about two years .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] the biggest flare , probably , was when she started school sports in the fall , just with all the sweating .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yup , that will do it . is there anything else that you've noticed , mrs. ward ? [Patient Guest] no . kayla really has been doing a good job with the facial care regimen . it just does n't seem to help as much as we wanted .[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] got it . okay . well , let's take a look then . full exam is performed today , except for under the underwear and under the bra . multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities . scattered skin colored papules . open and closed comedones . and erythmateous papules on the face , primarily on the forehead and with also some on the central cheeks and chin . the chest and back are relatively spared . and the remainder of the examination is normal . so , what i'm seeing from your exam today is mild to moderate acne , mostly comodonal with small inflammatory component . [Patient] okay , so is there anything we can do to help it ?[SEP][Medication][Doctor] yes . i would like to start with a topical therapy first . every morning , you will wash your face with a mild cleanser then use a moisturizer labeled , \" noncomedogenic , \" with sunscreen spf 30 or higher . this means it wo n't clog your pores . now , in the evening , wash your face with the same cleanser and allow it to dry . apply adapalene , 0.1 % cream , in a thin layer to the areas you generally get acne . i want you to start off using this a few nights a week and slowly work up to using it every night . if it is ... excuse me , if it is very expensive or not covered by insurance , you can try different gel over the counter . you can follow that with clean and clear persa-gel in a thin layer , or where you generally get acne . and then a noncomedogenic moisturizer . you're atopic retinoid will cause some sensitivity , so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside . it may also cause some dryness or irritation . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP][Physical Examination][Follow-up][Doctor] you also have multiple benign moles on your arms , legs , back and abdomen . this means they all look normal with no worrisome features . we will see if you have any progress over the next six months and follow up at that time .

[Patient] not too bad . and yourself ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ? [Patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on . [Patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high . [Patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] typically , it does n't . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive . [Patient] yeah , that's what they said .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ... [Patient] hm .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] uh , they did n't do a ct scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ? [Patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in . [Patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , maybe that's all it was . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ? [Patient] yes , i am .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] great . so here are my thoughts . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ? [Patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ? [Patient] sure , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see . [Patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing . [Patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works .

new patient , jordan roberts . date of birth : 3\/2\/1972 . he's a 49 year old , uh hm , with hypertension and palpitations . please copy forward his thyroid profile from march 1st , 2021 . hello mr. roberts , how are you doing today ? [Patient] i'm fine , thank you .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] good . good . so , i saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations . [Patient] yeah . that was back in march i think , but my girlfriend and i , we talked about it , and on that day i had a few cups of coffee , and no breakfast . so , i think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah . have you , uh , have you felt it again since ? [Patient] uh , no .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . uh , so tell me about the blood pressure then . [Patient] well , i've had issues with my blood pressure since i was young .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] do you have a family history of this ? [Patient] yeah . a lot of my family does have high blood pressure .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] uh , can you tell me which medications you're taking ? [Patient] my new med is , uh , a combo med , something 40-25 .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . um . yes , i see that in your chart . the benicar hct . it has hydrochlorothiazide in it . [Patient] yeah , that's it . my water pill i call it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . are you still taking the amlodipine , 10 milligrams daily ? [Patient] uh , yes i am .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] that's- that's a good start on a regimen . are you checking your blood pressure at home , and if yes , what numbers are you seeing ? [Patient] um , every day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] awesome . [Patient] yeah . every morning , i take it when i get up , and it's been running at about , uh , 146 to 155 lately .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so you're not down in the 120s yet ? [Patient] no , not yet . well , we're trying to get there though .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . uh , how are you doing with your salt intake ? [Patient] i'm trying to back off of it . i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure . [Patient] sounds good .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] are you doing any exercise ? [Patient] i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great . [Patient] good to hear .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts . [Patient] nope . nowhere .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ? [Patient] uh , no .[SEP][Discussion][Reassessment][Doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone . [Patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try . [Patient] all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room . [Patient] all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay . [Patient] all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon . [Patient] i'll definitely let you know if that happens .[SEP]","677":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey diana it's good to see you in here so i see that you injured your

ease it [Patient] yeah i did the ice thing i put ice on it and then i you know i even i have a ace wrap at home i try to do that[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen [Patient] this happened yesterday morning[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry [Patient] yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere [Patient] no not really[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay any numbness any tingling [Patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well [Patient] yeah it does[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like [Patient] not without extreme pain[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up [Patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt [Patient] yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright and then lateral as well [Patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist [Patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you [Patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down [Patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better[SEP][Physical Examination][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to [Patient] i'm sorry[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] pardon what [Patient] a what[SEP]","691":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] judy gomez , mrn 869723 . date of birth , 5 , 7 , 1961 . she's in office today for ongoing

[Patient] yeah , definitely . because i went to get my covid shots , um , but from the letter i got about it , it said that it could interfere with the vaccine , you know , reduce the efficacy . so i did n't take it on the week that i got the first shot .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and what happened ?

[Patient] correct . i've had the pain on and off for about two years . i finally went to the er and a ... a few months ago and they did a ct scan .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] i saw that . [Patient] yeah . they said they did n't really see anything on the scan .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] yes , i agree . it looked normal . [Patient] the problem is i'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] is the pain there all the time ? [Patient] it's a nagging feeling and it just depends . sometimes it bothers me , sometimes it does n't .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] has this been the case over the past two years as well ? [Patient] more recently in the past couple months , at least with the constipation and diarrhea .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] and before that , how are your bowel movements ?

[Patient] nope .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] do you feel like you have more constipation or diarrhea ? [Patient] probably more constipation .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , so when you're constipated , do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard ?

[Patient] about three to four times a week . it's like when i need to go to the bathroom , if i can massage it , it feels like it's moving some and i can eventually go .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and when you have a bowel movement , does the pain change ? [Patient] yeah , it gets a little better .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] and are you eating and drinking okay ? any nausea or vomiting , heartburn or indigestion ? [Patient] none of that .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . so tell me about the diarrhea , how often do you get it ?

[Patient] nope .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ? [Patient] i've never had any surgery .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all those are still intact ? [Patient] yup .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ? [Patient] no . i thought that happen when you turn 50 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well , that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy , like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants . [Patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain . [Patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ? [Patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ? [Patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ? [Patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ? [Patient] i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ? [Patient] hardly ever . maybe once a month .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] and do you consume alcohol ? [Patient] uh , yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay . and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice . [Patient] what would cause that ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted . [Patient] that's good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly . [Patient] what's that ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon . [Patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged . [Patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] correct . [Patient] so what does that mean ?[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged . [Patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ?[SEP][Medication][Acute Assessment][Doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that . [Patient] so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ?[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease . [Patient] so what do i need to do ?[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs . [Patient] okay . and then what ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too . [Patient] which medications ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ? [Patient] about 18 months .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives . [Patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol . [Patient] okay . i'll call him this afternoon .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that . [Patient] okay . when do you think i'll be able to get the ultrasound done ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] hopefully , within the next two weeks . you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up . [Patient] okay . and then what happens ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] when i get the results from the test , i will contact you . and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps . [Patient] and when should i see you again ?[SEP][Follow-up][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] uh , let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver . [Patient] okay . is there anything else i can do to help with these issues ?[SEP][Medication][Other Treatments][Drug History][Doctor] definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation . and be mindful of eating foods that you were sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea . [Patient] okay . and i'll talk to my primary care about my crestor .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] excellent . and do you have any other questions for me ? [Patient] i do n't think so .[SEP]","693":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] so tyler is a 56 -year-old male who presents today complaining of difficulty

running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years [Patient] okay do you think that could be causing me my my chest pain[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so [Patient] someone had told me before[SEP]","695":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] okay . maria martin , date of birth 03\/05\/1946 , has been

[Patient] no , doc . just pain . no tingling or numbless , numbness , thankfully .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] understood . understood . all right . well , let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on . [Patient] sounds good . thank you .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . use my general physical exam template . mr . james , i'm going to gently press around your shoulder and elbow here to see where your pain might be stemming from . just let me know when it hurts . [Patient] okay . it hurts when you press there on my elbow and here on my shoulder .[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay . left shoulder and elbow , tender sa space , no warmth , erythema or deformity . positive hawkins-kennedy and neer's test . normal proximal and distar , distal upper extremity strength . intact median radial ulnar sensation and abduction to 90 degrees . normal empty tan , can test . okay , mr . james , w-what i think you are dealing with is impingement syndrome of your left shoulder . i do n't think there's an additional injury or issue with your wrist , but because everything is connected , you're experiencing pain in your wrist because of your shoulder . we do see this type of issue when someone has a fall , so it's good you came to see us , you came in to see us so we could help . [Patient] so what are the possible treatments ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Referral][Doctor] well , we have a few options you can try . first option would be to start with physical therapy . i would recommend two sessions per week as well as any other exercises they give you to do at home . we can start there and if that does n't improve your pain , then we could try a cortisone injection . [Patient] i like the idea of starting with the physical therapy and have a next step if it does n't help . i am not opposed to a shot but would like to try the therapy first .[SEP]","697":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi bruce , how are you ?

[Patient] no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ? [Patient] sounds good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ? [Patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .[SEP][Personal History][Radiology Examination][Doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters . [Patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .[SEP][Personal History][Radiology Examination][Doctor] yep , definitely . based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ . [Patient] yes . unfortunately .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great ! [Patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ? [Patient] yes . fingers crossed .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you . [Patient] okay , sounds good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ? [Patient] i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ? [Patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . do you have children ? [Patient] i do . i have five .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice . [Patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i bet . sounds like fun . [Patient] it is .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ? [Patient] really , i did not .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ? [Patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those . [Patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ? [Patient] that's correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ? [Patient] yes , and that's all .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er\/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ? [Patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and how about family history ? [Patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] all right . any family history of breast cancer ? [Patient] none .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ? [Patient] i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ? [Patient] no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ? [Patient] nope , just penicillin .[SEP][Personal History][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you . okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes . in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero . do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ? [Patient] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you . [Patient] okay , sounds good .[SEP][Follow-up][Reassessment][Doctor] as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er\/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy . so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you . [Patient] okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ? [Patient] i do n't think so .[SEP]","699":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hi michelle what's been going on the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee [Patient]

so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts [Patient] yeah sometimes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like [Patient] walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it [Patient]

walking the dog [Patient] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee [Patient] no no i have n't would you recommend that[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it's pretty bad [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] we'll get we'll get to that too [Patient] okay[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today [Patient] yes[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay do i go into that to [Patient] yeah[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it [Patient] you're only cup of this[SEP][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Other Treatments][Doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Other Treatments][Doctor] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] does that make sense [Patient] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary [Patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this [Patient] okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right [Patient] okay alright i think that sounds good[SEP]","701":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] good morning noah tell me a little bit about why you are here today [Patient] hi document i'm i'm just had you know the back

Examination][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so i'm gon na listen to your heart here and it it does seem like i do hear a slight murmur with your heart here and i i do n't think we've we've heard that before so i think i'm gon na get an ekg as well because i'm concerned you might be having like a mild heart attack so because you have the pain all the way up your elbow that go into your neck and your your chest pain as well i do n't think it's it's it's musculoskeletal pain because you said you had n't done anything with it so far so what i wan na do is and let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan here so i i do think that you or you do have that chest pain i'm concerned that you know you might be having a mild heart attack i'm gon na get ekg for that we're also gon na get you some aspirin is a nitroglycerin just to see if that helps with that pain as far as your for your diabetes i want you we're gon na get that p oct glucose and we'll keep you on be five hundred of metformin for now and then for your hypertension we'll keep you on that two . five of of norvasc but i think our most immediate issue is the is the chest pain and so we'll do the ekg and depending upon those results we'll we'll call nine one one because we really need to get you to the hospital if that is the case so how does that sound [Patient] i do n't know i was talking to my brother and he's a he is a heart doctor and he kinda thought maybe it was n't the heart but[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i did n't hear about that no [Patient] yeah he he he yeah he

it's it's probably with with with the metformin it seems to be you know one twenty[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good your blood sugars are running in the one twenties that's really good okay alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good i do think you're doing a good job with taking your lisinopril your blood pressure's about one twenty two over seventy right now which is right where we want it your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty seven again which is right where we want it and i do n't appreciate any fever today you you have a normal temperature at ninety eight . four which is really good so i'm just gon na be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally on your right knee exam i do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance over your right patella now does it hurt when i press [Patient] it's a little bit sore[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all [Patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Medication][Doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so do you have any questions about that [Patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just[SEP][Reassessment][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Medication][Doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound [Patient] that's fine[SEP]","705":"[Conversation

i see here that you looks like you hurt your left foot here where you were playing soccer can you tell me a little bit more about what happened [Patient] yeah so yeah i was playing in a soccer game yesterday and i was trying to steal the ball from another player and she ended up falling directly onto my right foot and i do n't know i i mean i was trying to get around her and my body ended up twisting around her and then i accidentally felt a pain in my foot[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so have you ever hurt your left foot before [Patient] no i've had a lot of injuries in soccer but never injured this foot[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then so after the fall and the entanglement with the other player were you able to continue playing [Patient] no i had to stop playing right away and actually being helped off the field[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] wow okay and what have you been doing for the the pain since then [Patient] so i've been keeping it elevated icing it the trainer wrapped it yesterday and taking ibuprofen as well[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright so without any ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is [Patient] without ibuprofen i would say my pain is a three[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then with your ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is [Patient] like a seven eight[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay so how long have you been playing soccer [Patient] really since i was like four five i've been playing a long time[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well that's cool yeah we our our youngest daughter she is almost sixteen and she plays the inner marrial soccer league they are down at the rex center did is that where you started playing or did you guys did you start playing somewhere else [Patient] yeah just like this local town leak i started playing that way and then played all throughout school[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] that's [Patient] high school teams[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] that's awesome so just out of curiosity with the left foot have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or or any strange sensation [Patient] no i have not[SEP][Physical Examination][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of [Patient] alright thank you[SEP]","718":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 . hey , miss christine , how are you

nonhealing foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it [Patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [Patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [Patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [Patient] i do n't recall the name exactly[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] do n't recall alright [Patient] something i had taken it before[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [Patient] i'm sorry[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [Patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [Patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red[SEP][Personal History][Reassessment][Doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [Patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay do you [Patient] i'm not really sure how[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [Patient] i think they told me it was around ten[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [Patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [Patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [Patient] that sounds great[SEP]","721":"[Conversation

[Patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad .

[Patient] yeah , that sounds good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today . [Patient Guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense . [Patient Guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wow . okay . [Patient Guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ? [Patient Guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel . [Patient Guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .[SEP]","723":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Lab Examination][Doctor] next patient is paul edwards , date of birth is january 15th 1962 . so he's a 59 year old hiv positive gentleman here for hypogonadism . patient was last seen on november 24th 2020 . his notable things are number one , he is on 1 milliliter every 10 days , uh , his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he's on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily so he takes all his pills just from me . um , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia which is ... which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500 . hey , how are you today ?

[Patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .[SEP]","724":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12\/27\/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ? [Patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad . [Patient] yes , that's correct .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ? [Patient] yeah , that sounds good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today . [Patient Guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense . [Patient Guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wow . okay . [Patient Guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ? [Patient Guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel . [Patient Guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mhm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ? [Patient Guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] got you . okay . [Patient Guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] hmm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Chitchat][Doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ? [Patient Guest] only pepcid .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ? [Patient Guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ? [Patient Guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ? [Patient Guest] yes , that is correct . he did .[SEP]","725":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , andrew . how are you ?

little bit about how you're doing [Patient] yeah it's still quite a problem you know something i've been suffering with for so long now it's still quite itchy and it's really embarrassing too because i'll have dandruff so much like all over me but but i just ca n't stop itching[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay when did you first notice this [Patient] i wan na say it's been a while but probably worsening in the past like six months or so[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay okay and have you seen ever noticed any rashes either when it first started or intermittently anywhere else [Patient] on my body no not really[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay okay just mainly up underneath your on your scalp there uh and i can i can see that man that looks really itchy and scaly have you died your hair recently or used any other chemicals you you know like a new hair spray or gel [Patient] nothing new i mean i do dye my hair but i've been doing that for years now but otherwise i do n't really use a lot of products in my hair[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yeah i you know it's funny you say that because i keep saying i earned this gray hair and i'm gon na keep it so yeah have you tried any over the counter treatments i know there is a lot out of there something you know like a t gel or any of those other have those helped [Patient] yeah i did that i did head and shoulders i even tried some castor oil and but none of them really seemed to be helping[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay okay let's talk about some other symptoms any joint pain fever weight loss [Patient] not that i can recall i've been pretty good otherwise[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay good and going back you know to your grandparents has anybody else in the family had similar symptoms that you're aware of [Patient] no well maybe my sister[SEP][Family History][Doctor] maybe your sister okay [Patient] yeah maybe my sister i mean i know she'll is no one has as bad as i do but she does report like just having a dry scalp[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay okay now you know a lot of times we can see this with you know high levels of stress has there been any new mental or emotional stressors at work or at home [Patient] not really i mean it's basically the same things[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Follow-up][Medication][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay yeah i yeah we have a lot of that yes so let me go ahead and and look at this a little closer here the first off i wan na tell you the the vital signs that the my assistant took when you came in your blood pressure is one thirty over sixty eight your heart rate was ninety eight and your respiratory rate was eighteen so those all look good and appear normal and your temperature was ninety seven . seven and that is all normal now when i look at your scalp here i do notice that you have demarcated scaly erythematous plaques and that's just kind of explaining technically what's going on those patches and they're they're in a patchy format they're diffusely present across the back of your skull and that's probably why you you see all that that that white dander you know on your on your your clothes as you go through the day now lem me talk a little bit about my impression and plan i think that you have a scalp psoriasis and let's and here is my thoughts on that what i would like you to use is to use clobetasol that's a zero . zero five percent solution and i want you to use that twice daily on the the affected areas of your scalp so you're just gon na put this on and just kinda gently rub it in now i know to do it twice daily is going to be difficult but if you can do it first thing in the morning when you get up and then before you go to bed you know get a shower and before you go to bed that will be great i want you to continue to use t-gel shampoo that you listed when you first came in that's a very good solution shampoo for that and that will help with controlling a lot of this now there is no cure for this unfortunately and flareups can be unpredictable but we see that you know not a we do n't have a great finger on what causes the flare ups but i'm gon na give you some steroids that will help and we're gon na have to manage that on a ongoing basis but when you get do get a flare up i want you to be using these flare steroid that i give you as we go through that and then i wan na see you back here in three months or sooner if it gets significantly worse do you have any questions for me [Patient] no okay so i'll just use that steroid solution and then just as needed if it's really bad but then otherwise just use the t gel[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah i want it's exactly what i want you to do i want you to use that that solution twice daily when you get that flare but then other than that just continue to use that t-gel shampoo [Patient] alright[SEP][Follow-up][Doctor] okay i'm gon na have my nurse come in and get you discharged but i the we will see you again in three months or and again please if it gets worse please do n't hesitate to call me and come in sooner [Patient] alright perfect thank you[SEP]","727":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey
