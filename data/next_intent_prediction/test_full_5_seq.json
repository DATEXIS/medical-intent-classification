[Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","17":"[Therapeutic History][Doctor] yeah , i can see , that makes sense . have you been taking your medication regularly ? your on xeljanz right ?

[Patient] yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ? [Patient] i'd say it's about the same .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good . [Patient] okay . good .[SEP]","90":"[Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .

[Patient] and he did die in his 40s . that's what it said in the note earlier .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . yeah . he died in his 40s , but i thought it was from a massive heart attack . died at 47 of a massive heart- [Patient] he died ... it- it's saying that it meant ... it means he died on dia ... like , he was ... he was , um , utilizing dialysis .[SEP]","91":"[Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] is that helping [Patient] somewhat yes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright do you want something stronger [Patient] no i'm okay[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] alright so let's just continue with ibuprofen you can take you know six hundred to eight hundred milligrams every eight hours as needed i wan na go ahead and put you in a brace that's gon na help your knee feel a bit more supported okay and let's go ahead and i'm hoping that we can get this mri done in you know the next couple days and then we can have a conversation about what needs to be done now you said that you are are are you know obviously a very active active mom any other exercise or anything else that that i should be aware of that you do just wondering in terms of which kind of graft we would use to fix this with your with your acl being injured [Patient] hmmm no i not i i would like to get back to the running but currently not that active[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay alright alright do you have any questions about anything [Patient] i think you've explained it well[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay alright so i'll see you again soon okay [Patient] okay thank you[SEP]","92":"[Chitchat][Doctor] that's awesome . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] that's great news . um , and then how's your depression doing ? [Patient] i have my moments .[SEP]","93":"[Conversation Start][SEP][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] okay well hi joe i understand you've hurt your knee how how are you doing [Patient] i'm doing okay this feels you know definitely feels like it's swollen and kinda hurts me a little bit[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so what did you do what happened [Patient] i was i was skiing with some with some friends and i was going down it was snowing pretty hard and i could n't really see as as the two paths kind of come came together and i the front end of the skis i kind of dug into the snow and i ended up basically doing a cart wheel but kinda like stopped halfway through and could feel a pop in my my right knee and then you know just pain right after that came about through the knee so[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah that sounds painful and so when did this occur [Patient] it it occurred over the weekend on saturday[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and have you been able to to walk at all at all or no [Patient] a a little bit but it's definitely swollen and it's definitely painful[SEP]","94":"[Vegetative History][Doctor] any smoke you do n't have to tell me exactly but [Patient] okay[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] have you smoked [Patient] next maybe that i have n't[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] are you it's okay i'm your doctor i'm not here to judge you i just want to make sure that i'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you i need to know this information so one more time do you smoke or have you smoked before [Patient] okay i smoked[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it [Patient] i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay you have [Patient] too many questions are you the fit[SEP]","95":"[Greetings][Doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on [Patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta [Patient] yes and and fish oil[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that [Patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy[SEP][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so [Patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents[SEP]","96":"[Personal History][Doctor] okay so we are we are gon na have to negotiate some of these diet things and then especially since you have diabetes like have you been managing that well [Patient] my i've been watching my sugars yep because i do n't wan na go on insulin so i'm taking that metformin that's why i've been walking my dog i'm trying to stay active[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay okay so you know maybe this is just a situation of like where we are on the right path but probably need to step up a few things okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so i do want to do a quick physical exam so you are aware i'm going to be calling out my findings as i run through it alright [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Referral][Medication][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Acute Assessment][Doctor] alright so your vital signs look good you know so i'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention so and then on top of that i'm not i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits so i'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam though there is a three over six systolic ejection murmur heard at the that i'm hearing at the left base that's not like a huge deal especially considering like what you've been through already in terms of the hospital but it is something that i wan na know in your chart when i listen to you your lungs your lungs are clear over here with your extremities i do notice you know some lower lower edema swelling sorry some lower swelling edema lower limb edema and it it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery the cath site is clean dry and intact without hematoma and i also your right radial artery pulses are palpable so i did review the results of your ekg and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good r wave progression and a a evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a stemi one of the reasons though that we had you come in is that we noticed on your echo there is a reduced ejection fraction of thirty five percent we are a little bit concerned about that so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary and like first diagnosis is gon na be coronary artery disease right you already have a history of that but you know we're gon na do some things to make we're gon na continue to evaluate that over time i want you to continue your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and your brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily i wan na continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor and you're gon na be taking that eighty milligrams a day and we're gon na continue you on your toprol and that's gon na be fifty milligrams daily i am gon na refer you to cardiac rehab so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to get back to exercising regularly i know it was kinda scary to have such an episode but i promise like most of the patients i have love cardiac rehab and i think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis we have newly you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation what i think is like what that means is that you're you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit concerning but i think like given your history that it will improve over time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly so i think that the muscle is just kinda like stunned like surprised and since you're compliant with your meds i think you will recover we are gon na continue you on your lisinopril twenty milligrams daily however considering that you are retaining fluid i think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure i'm gon na prescribe something called a diuretic it's called lasix and i do want to we need to take that forty milligrams once a day i wan na add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and i need you to get labs finally we will repeat another echo in about two months last but not least there is the hypertension your blood pressure seems fine i think with the aldactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider like what other diet options might be available to you maybe suggestions of things that you have n't thought about like cutting out meat especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni but maybe finding you some alternatives how does that sound [Patient] that sounds good yeah so i'm yeah as long as you tell me i'm gon na get better i believe you[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yes yeah i i strongly believe this is our best course of action and that you will get better given enough time i i see that you are making efforts i'm really glad that you are out there walking and that you're cognizant of your diet and willing to make changes we will just you know monitor it over time okay [Patient] okay[SEP]","97":"[Discussion][Doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see . [Patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing . [Patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works . [Patient] yeah .[SEP]","98":"[Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today . [Patient Guest] okay . thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Other Treatments][Doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead . [Patient Guest] okay . that sounds good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and does ashley play any sports ? [Patient Guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .[SEP][Other Treatments][Doctor] how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water . [Patient Guest] okay . great . we will work on that .[SEP]","99":"[Radiology Examination][Doctor] hey dragon ? show me the back x-ray . so in reviewing the results of your back x-ray , this looks like a normal x-ray . there's good bony alignment , there's normal uh- there's no fracture present . uh , so this is a normal x-ray of your back , which is not surprising based on- [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] . the history , okay ? [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Medication][Doctor] so let's just go ahead and we'll- we're going to go over , you know , my assessment and my plan for you . so for your first problem , your back pain . you know , i think you have a lumbar strain from the lifting . so , let's go ahead . we can prescribe you some meloxicam 15 mg once a day . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Referral][Medication][Doctor] i want you to continue to ice it , okay . i want you to try to avoid any strenuous activity and we can go ahead and- and refer you to physical therapy- [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] . and see how you do , okay ? [Patient] you got it .[SEP]","100":"[Physical Examination][Doctor] okay that that's good yeah it sounds like you have sensation there so yeah that that's really good so let me do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals your blood pressure was one twenty over eighty which is good your heart rate your spo2 was ninety eight percent which is good that means you're you're getting all of your oxygen and so let me go ahead and look at your ankle real quick so when i press here does that hurt [Patient] yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright what about here [Patient] yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so looking at your ankle and your right ankle exam on the skin there is ecchymosis so you have that bruising which you can see of the lateral [Patient] malleolus[SEP][Physical Examination][Personal History][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] malleolus associated with swelling there is tenderness to palpation of the anterior laterally in the soft tissue there is no laxity on the anterior drawer and inversion stress there is no bony tenderness on palpation of the foot on your neurovascular exam of your right foot there your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch alright so we did get an x-ray of your ankle before you came in and luckily it's there is no fractures no bony abnormalities which is really good so let me talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for your right ankle pain your symptoms your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain have you sprained your ankle before most times people do the athletics play soccer it happens every so often but have you done that before [Patient] no i do n't think so[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay well you're one of the lucky ones some of my my patients that play sports they sprain their ankle seems like every other week so good for you so for that that that ankle sprain i just want to keep i want you to keep your leg elevated when you're seated and i want you to continue to ice it you can ice it let's say five times a day for twenty minutes at a time just to help that swelling go down i'm gon na give you an air cast to help you stabilize the ankle so keep it from moving and then i'll give you crutches and so i want you to stay off that leg for about one to two days and then you can start walking on it as tolerated tolerated so how does that sound [Patient] it's alright[SEP]","101":"[Acute Symptoms][Doctor] anytime i move it do you remember falling [Patient] no i do n't think so but my kid got pretty rough with me and was checking me several times with a sick[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright yeah that that that definitely makes sense so how would you describe the pain is it like a dull pain is it stabbing what what would you say [Patient] it it's a pretty sharp pain[SEP]","102":"[Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and then you said that standing also makes it worse right [Patient] yeah if i stand for a while[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and then have you experienced any like loss of control of like your bladder or your bowels [Patient] yeah i pooped myself once[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay so incontinence just once though like over the last two years right it's not like a consistent thing [Patient] no it's not consistent i think i stood up for too long i think i was drinking too[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay okay you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past like what were they [Patient] so i i had a doc gave me some injections before i'm not sure what they were though[SEP]","103":"[Discussion][Medication][Acute Assessment][Doctor] those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something [Patient] i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] alright [Patient] can i get pain pills too[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] can you [Patient] for pain[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] can you get what now [Patient] pain pills[SEP]","104":"[Personal History][Doctor] okay . good . so , no- no issues with any stiffness or pain or flare ups over the last year ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and i know that we have you on the methotrexate , are you still taking that once a week ? [Patient] yes , i am .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and any issues with that ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] no . okay . and then in terms of your a-fib , how are you doing with that ? are you having any palpitations ? or , i know that you've kind of been in and out of it over the past , you know , year or so . [Patient] yeah . i've still been having palpitations . the- the last one i had was about a week ago . i've noticed that when i start to get stressed , um , they start to flare up again . so , i've been trying meditation , trying running with my dog to try and relieve the stress but it has n't really been working .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah . i- i know that you had called , um , last month and we- we did that event monitor for you , uh , which we'll take a look at in a few minutes . okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP]","105":"[Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . and all right , let's go ahead do a quick physical exam . hey , dragon , show me the vitals . so looking here at your vital signs today , um , they look really good . so i'm just gon na go ahead and take a listen to your heart and lungs . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay , so on physical examination , you know , everything seems to look really good , um lungs are nice and clear , your heart's at a regular rate and rhythm . you do have some trace pitting edema to your lower extremities so what that means is that it looks like you might be retaining a little bit of fluid- [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] um , did they give you a lot of fluid in the emergency room ? [Patient] they actually did .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , all right , so it might just be from that . okay , well let's look at some of your results . hey , dragon , show me the glucose . okay , so yeah , you know i know that they just checked your blood sugar now and it was 162 and you know , what ... you know , did you eat before this ? [Patient] uh , probably about two hours ago .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , all right . hey , dragon , show me the diabetes labs . yeah , so your hemoglobin a1c here is is 8 , you know last time we had seen it , it was about 6 and we had n't put you on medications so , um , i think it's something we'll have to talk about , okay ? [Patient] you got it .[SEP]","106":"[Chitchat][Doctor] good to see you too . so i know the nurse told you about dax , i'd like to tell dax a little about you . [Patient] sure .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] so john is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for anxiety and epilepsy who presents with an abnormal lab finding . so , john , um , i , uh , was notified by the emergency room that you , um , had a really high blood sugar and you were in there with , uh ... they had to treat you for that , what was going on ? [Patient] yeah , we've been going from place to place for different events and we've had a lot of visitors over the last couple of weeks and i just was n't monitoring my sugar intake and , uh , a little too much stress and strain i think over the last couple of weeks .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , yeah , i had gone through your hemoglobin a1c's and you know , they were borderline in the past but- [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] -i guess , you know , i guess they're high now so how are you feeling since then ? [Patient] so far so good .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , did they put you on medication ? [Patient] uh , they actually did .[SEP]","107":"[Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . um , so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ?

[Patient] uh , well usually we go to friday's restaurant . i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce . [Patient] but it normally does n't bother me .[SEP]","108":"[Greetings][Doctor] hi , anna , how are you ? [Patient] i'm doing okay . how are you ?[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm doing well . uh , so i know the nurse told you a little bit about dax . i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] all right . so , uh , anna is a 26-year-old female with a past medical history , significant for epilepsy , depression , and , uh , peptic ulcer disease , who presents with , uh , some joint pain . so , anna , what's going on with your , uh , what's going on with your joints ?

[Patient] yep , it is .[SEP]","109":"[Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright and any chest pain or shortness of breath or anything like that no no yeah no nothing more than yeah i would n't attribute anything [Patient] okay and do you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here [Patient] no[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Referral][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help [Patient] any questions[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Referral][Doctor] yeah i mean is this do we have to do any more tests or anything what are you we're gon na do an arterial ultrasound i'm going to go ahead and order an arterial ultrasound of your lower extremities to see what the blood supply is like and then i'm gon na go ahead and order a podiatry consult because i want them to see this wound and improve the wound care that you're doing and then for your next problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and talk to your primary care physician we need to get your diabetes better controlled because that impacts your wound healing as well okay [Patient] sure[SEP][Reassessment][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] sure understood alright and for your last issue your coronary artery disease continue with your statin and i will talk to your cardiologist in case you need a procedure to see if you're cleared from a medical standpoint okay [Patient] okay perfect[SEP]","110":"[Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright and do you feel short of breath at rest

History][Doctor] okay alright so we talked a little bit about your diabetes let's talk about your heart disease now your heart disease you had a heart attack in twenty eighteen we put a stent into your right coronary artery you're still taking your medications for that you're still on your aspirin [Patient] i am yes yeah i do the baby aspirin every day[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright

exams[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here [Patient] no[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Referral][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help [Patient] any questions[SEP]","140":"[Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] alright david so you were just in the emergency department hopefully you can hear me

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise . um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure . [Patient] really ? i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah , yeah . it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium . um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that . um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information . um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff . [Patient] okay . i'll definitely check that out .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Referral][Medication][Doctor] all right . so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes . uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] all right . so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension . they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up . when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure . [Patient] that's interesting .[SEP]","156":"[Physical Examination][Doctor] gotcha okay alright well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before i take a look at your knee here i'm gon na do a physical exam and in terms of your gait here i did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation so let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick i do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of ecchymosis let me just feel around here scott how does that feel does that hurt when i kinda press on that there [Patient] a little bit of pain there not not really bad it's it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel [Patient] just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam fifty milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan [Patient] it it does now well i need to limit my work activities i i typically sit behind a desk but it's not been very comfortable sitting here lately[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Doctor] yeah definitely so yeah so you you can limit the activities for sure in terms of your work activities i know if you sit too long sometimes it can be painful because you do need to move that leg a little bit so it does n't lock up so i i would like for you to you know do do some slight activities not enough to stress your legs but definitely move move them a little bit every now and then so it does n't lock up on you okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] alright i do want you to i know you are i know you actually jog often so i want you to just slow that down for a bit no jogging for a while until we get you know results of your mri till we figure out what we what we are gon na be doing okay [Patient] okay[SEP]","157":"[Medication][Lab Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] that can certainly cause your blood sugar to be elevated . um , hey dragon , uh , show me the rapid strep . and you also have , uh , positive for strep . so i think we have some reasons as to why your blood sugar is so high . so my impression of you , you know , you have this hyperglycemia , which is probably related to some infections going on in your body . um , from a- a- a rapid strep standpoint we're gon na go ahead and treat you with penicillin or , i'm sorry , amoxicillin , 500 milligrams , three times a day . uh , make sure you take it all , even if you start feeling better , okay ?

[Patient] okay .[SEP]","173":"[Personal History][Doctor] okay good good and then for your asthma have you had any recent asthma attacks and are you still taking the flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed for wheezing [Patient] yes but sometimes i forget you know i have n't had any asthma attacks lately so i just figured i could decrease[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yep okay [Patient] i think that's a good decision though[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Follow-up][Medication][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Acute Assessment][Drug History][Doctor] yeah well better to stay on the flovent daily and then just use the albuterol if you need it but if you stay on the flovent daily it will decrease the frequency of those attacks so yeah alright well let's go ahead and examine you okay so on your physical exam it's pretty normal for the most part unremarkable but i i'll i'll say on your on your heart exam you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam and and i'm not worried about that we're kinda watching that but it just means i hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving and otherwise normal heart exam for your abdominal exam you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen your abdomen's otherwise soft there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever and there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant so i think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen so i think that you know that may be you may be right this could be some gastritis so so then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam you do have some mild end expiratory wheezes very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam so let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here so first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain i do think that you have acute gastritis and i think this is probably related to the caffeine intake and i i know that you've had a a moderately heavy history of alcohol use too so i want you to cut back on the alcohol as well you know keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great and then also cut back on the caffeine and that should help and i'm going to write you a prescription for zantac as well as we need and so i'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain and then i'm going to check a urinalysis a urine pregnancy test a cbc a comprehensive metabolic panel as well and we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on and then for your second problem of diabetes type two let's continue you on the metformin but i wan na adjust the dose slightly i'm gon na increase the morning dose to one thousand milligrams and the evening dose we can keep at five hundred so we'll go metformin one thousand milligrams in the morning and five hundred milligrams in the evening please continue to check your blood sugars let me know what they are when you come back you know we just keep track of those and then we'll see you back in four weeks by the way i wan na have you follow up with me in four weeks and for your third problem of asthma let's continue you on the flovent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily and then also albuterol as needed so how does that sound for a plan any other questions comments suggestions [Patient] that sounds good and i also feel like i'm eating been eating a lot of spicy food[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay yeah i'd also recommend while this is hurting you definitely cut back on the spices the spicy food easier said than done sometimes i know but yep yep alright sounds good well listen i'll see you back in four weeks give me a holler if if you have any questions or anything else in the meantime [Patient] i will[SEP]","174":"[Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright yeah but yeah i can feel it here so it does feel a little bit warm so i said you've been in a little bit of pain so have you taken anything for it [Patient] well like last night i iced it and i kept it elevated you know i also took some ibuprofen last night and this morning[SEP][Acute

have like bad ankles where they hurt the ankles all the time but have you ever injured this ankle before [Patient] so you know in high school i used to play a lot of soccer but and and like i had other injuries but i've never injured like this particular ankle before but because i used to play like all the time i knew what i was supposed to do but this is i also knew that it was it was time to come in[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay yeah yeah definitely if you if you ca n't walk on it we definitely good thing that you came in today and we were able to see you so have you experienced any numbness in your foot at all [Patient] no no numbness and i do n't think i've had like any tingling or anything like that[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay that that's good yeah it sounds like you have sensation there so yeah that that's really good so let me do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals your blood pressure was one twenty over eighty which is good your heart rate your spo2 was ninety eight percent which is good that means you're you're getting all of your oxygen and so let me go ahead and look at your ankle real quick so when i press here does that hurt

hair[SEP]","176":"[Personal History][Doctor] okay did you hit your head when you when this happened [Patient] a little bit[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright did you pass out [Patient] nope nope stayed conscious throughout[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Referral][Radiology Examination][Medication][Doctor] okay alright well looking at your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever your blood pressure looks quite good it's about one twenty two over seventy six your heart rate is appropriate at eighty two beats per minute and your oxygenation is ninety five percent on room air on your cervical spine exam there is no tenderness to palpation of the cervical spine there is full range of motion on head exam there does not appear to be any trauma there is no ecchymosis or bruising on the right shoulder exam on your musculoskeletal exam there is pain to palpation of the posterior shoulder at the acromioclavicular joint there is decreased abduction and adduction to about ninety degrees only there is there is a he has pain with supination and pronation of the right arm and there is a palpable radial radial artery pulse okay so what does that mean that just means that you have some you know evidence of the injury there and we'll we're gon na talk about that so i had the nurse do a shoulder x-ray on you before i came in the room and the results of your right shoulder x-ray showed that you have an acute acromioclavicular joint fracture so you just have a a a small fracture of the acromion i do n't think that it it's gon na be anything that we need to do surgery for so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your right shoulder injury for your acute acromioclavicular joint fracture i wan na go ahead and just put you in a sling for now i wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i wan na go ahead and just order a cat scan of your right shoulder just to kinda get a better look of how the joint looks and we're gon na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to strengthen your shoulder in hopes of avoiding surgery in the future how does that sound [Patient] yeah that that sounds great just being able to take a little bit of something for the pain would would would be really appreciated[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay do you think you need something stronger than meloxicam [Patient] no i'll give that a shot[SEP]","177":"[Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and has that helped at all [Patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here [Patient] i had my tonsils out[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press [Patient] yeah that's sore[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt [Patient] yeah do n't do that anymore[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Referral][Medication][Doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that [Patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan[SEP]","178":"[Greetings][Doctor] hi dennis how are you today [Patient]

[Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so for your first problem , your , your knee pain , you know , i'm concerned that it might be from , you know , a flareup of your lupus , so i wan na go ahead and order and autoimmune panel to kinda see where we stand , okay ? [Patient] sure .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] hey , dragon . order an autoimmune panel . for your next problem , the coronary artery disease , i think you're doing really well , your ekg looks good , your vital signs look good . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP]","201":"[Personal History][Doctor] are you still wearing the splint only on your right wrist ? [Patient] no . i wear the left one also sometimes . the right one's just worse . the splint seems to help . both have gotten worse over the last month . when i broke them though , my wrist was definitely in worse shape than it is today . i've been having some mild stiffness in my neck too . i hit my head during the accident , and they told me it was a contusion .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and where exactly on the right side would you say the tingling and numbness is ? [Patient] on the right , i can really notice it from my middle and ring finger all the way up to my forearm , and on my left , a bit more the pinky and the ring and not the middle .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] all right . and , um , is there is pain or , or just tingling and numbness ? [Patient] uh , mainly just sore . sometimes they throb , but overall , they feel weaker too , especially when i'm using them . the tingling happens some more , but when they hurt , you know , it goes away and then the tingling's just dull .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] what kind of activities ? [Patient] well , really , i guess , just more so at night , and then it just kind of comes and goes throughout the day .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ? [Patient] uh , like , like feeling something ? no , not that i can think of really . in general , they might be less sensitive than they should be , but i can still feel . they gave me some nerve pain medicine , but i have n't been taking it like i should be .[SEP]","202":"[Acute Symptoms][Doctor] really ? [Patient] yeah . yeah , so , um , i was going down hill , double diamonds , uh , double black diamonds , and i just lost control , and i , you know , flipped down a few ways , but , uh , somewhere along the way , i , i jammed my , my index finger on something . i'm not sure what .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . so this happened last saturday , you said ? [Patient] it was saturday , yes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . so about five days of this right index finger pain . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] have you taken any medicine for it ? [Patient] i took some ibuprofen . um , did n't really seem to help .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . have you iced it or put a splint on it ? [Patient] no .[SEP]","203":"[Conversation Start][SEP][Greetings][Doctor] good morning rebecca , nice to see you . [Patient] nice to see you too .[SEP]","204":"[Conversation Start][SEP][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] hi betty how are you i i read in the medical records that you ended you did end up having a heart attack they ended up putting a stent in your right coronary artery how are you doing [Patient] i'm thankful to be alive but definitely struggling and definitely scary time for me[SEP]","205":"[Therapeutic History][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay it's really gon na be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed i'd really like to see you start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and and let's set that that pill bottle down on the counter and see if that does n't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam on your eyes i'm gon na go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me [Patient] okay that's a bright light[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Medication][Doctor] yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection [Patient] have you ever somebody stick a needle in your eye[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah literally yeah [Patient] yeah[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] the good news is injection given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it however i also have to let you know that there could be a situation where you may still note a small amount of vision loss but this is your best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as you can so i know i have given you a lot of information i wan na pause here and see if you have any questions comments or concerns before we get you scheduled for that injection [Patient] no i'm i mean as as long as you think it wo n't hurt a lot that will be good[SEP]","206":"[Physical Examination][Doctor] okay let me come around let me lift up the left side if i lift that up does that cause [Patient] yeah yeah yeah that's that's[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Physical Examination][Doctor] i can see that gritts on your face so okay that's good and you know as i look at your lower extremities there is no pain or numbness or tingling in your feet or anything like that [Patient] hmmm no[SEP][Reassessment][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Referral][Medication][Doctor] okay okay so lem me talk a little bit about my impression and plan so for that low back pain i believe you have a musculoskeletal low back strain i'm going to order a low back x-ray so we'll order that and get that done as an outpatient i do n't expect to see anything significant but it's gon na tell me how those joint spaces look and if you know if we're dealing with any disk issue but that will be the start of it and i'm also gon na order some physical therapy two for two reasons to help with a little bit with the pain but also strengthen some of the muscles there in the back so those are the two things that we are gon na do now i want you to take take four hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that occasionally with some tylenol when the pain gets more severe up to about three times a day i'm gon na also give you a prescription for some flexeril that's a muscle relaxant and i want you to take one of those once a day every evening but be careful if you're doing any strenuous or hazardous activities such as driving after you take those now for your diabetes my impression is that your diabetes is is under control i noticed that we do n't have n't had a a1c for almost five months so i'm also gon na order an a1c so we can find out where we are with that continue with your diet and exercise we know that's really important and then continue with your metformin i'm not gon na make any changes today but we'll go ahead and look at that once i get that results of that a1c do you have any questions for me [Patient] yeah can i still go to the bakery[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] i would yes it's nice for you to go to the bakery but you ca n't have any donuts i'm no i you just really need to watch that intake of of anything that you might get at the at the bakery so just just be careful with those carbohydrates those sweets that you're taking as we go through your day it's occasional occasional one perfectly fine but on a routine basis we need to watch that [Patient] right and how soon should i you know check my blood sugars i mean what's a good you know[SEP]","207":"[Personal History][Doctor] okay and have you ever injured your knees before [Patient] you know despite how active i am i you know i've never[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Referral][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay great so let's go ahead and do a i just wan na take a look here i reviewed your vitals and overall they look good your blood pressure is one twenty over seventy your your heart rate is sixty and your respiratory rate is fourteen those are all phenomenal numbers as i listened to your heart it is at a regular and a slower rate but i do n't hear any extra sounds so there is no murmurs as we go through that now on musculoskeletal exam you have a normal gait i watched you you know kinda walk in here this morning your strength i just wan na check it when i go ahead and i want you to move your leg okay your muscle strength is is good you do have a three out of five for abduction of your legs bilaterally and that's you know kinda bringing your legs in the remainder of your muscle strength for your lower extremities is a five out of five now let me focus specifically on your knee examination i do n't see any redness or ecchymosis or warmth of the skin and those are big words you know i do n't see any bruising or or that redness there is no effusion that's just like a fluid underneath the knee i do n't appreciate that any at all you do seem to have some tenderness when i palpate and you do have a positive patellar grind test when you stood up i could feel that as we went through there you did say you had that knee pain with squatting but your lachman your anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray test are all negative bilaterally neurologically and your your your lower extremities your patella and your achilles reflex are symmetrical and that's good so i did review the x-rays of both your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so based on what you told me and reviewing the mri that you had done before you came in your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a really common condition that we see that causes knee knee pain especially in really active young people that's probably why i do n't get it when i'm riding my bike forever and ever now this condition has to do with the way your kneecap moves across along the groove of your thigh bone your femur so for pain i want you to continue to take the ibuprofen or any other anti-inflammatories you know aleve or any of those as you need it to help with the pain now i am going to recommend physical therapy well they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises this is probably one of the best things that you can do and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you might have do you have any questions for me [Patient] so will i be able to run again[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] absolutely my goal is to get you out there and maybe we can cross pads on the the bike trail some day you are gon na have to take it a little bit easy for now but we are gon na get you back and once we do that i think you will be really pleased is there anything else [Patient] no i think that's it[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay have a great day [Patient] okay you too[SEP]","208":"[Physical Examination][Doctor] okay no pain with extension either does it hurt while you're just standing here [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so pain when

and urinary tract . which is basically something is wrong with the plumbing . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] so the only way to know that , is to do a kidney ultrasound .

to let's try to you know use the breathing treatments and and do that for the second problem the diabetes that we just talked about i like to go ahead and order another blood test another hemoglobin a1c i think we need to your blood sugars have been running a little bit high in the past and we've had a hard time but it's been a while since we checked your last one so i wan na check another one today to see where we are and when we have you come back in a couple days we should have the results back we can then adjust your metformin or we may have to adjust some of the you know add a different medication at that point but but right now i'm gon na order some blood tests we'll have you come back in a couple of days and then we can reassess at that point okay [Patient] so i had a piece of cake before i came in here is that gon na affect the the lab work[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] yeah we'll probably do a fasting blood sugar we'll we'll order the hemoglobin a1c that should n't be actually matter because that checks long term but if we need your blood sugar may be elevated today i i would n't be surprised alright and i forgot to examine your back by the way so on your back exam you do have some tenderness in the paraspinal areas of your back in the in the lower back mostly no midline tenderness you have good reflexes so i think this is all muscular pain right now for your back pain i'm gon na go ahead and put you on some naprosyn and some flexeril which is a muscle relaxer i'm gon na give you some exercises you can do to help you

[Patient] sure .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] all right . so on physical examination , everything looks pretty good , so on your neck exam , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits . on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base , which we've heard in the past . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] your lungs are nice and clear and you do have uh one plus non-pitting edema bilaterally in your lower extremities . so what does all that mean ? it just means i heard a little sound in your heart , which you know is n't anything clinically significant . we had looked into that last year . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] you do have a little swelling in your legs but that might just be from your your diet recently , okay . [Patient] sure .[SEP]","230":"[Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . so , you know , looking at you , your neck is very supple . i do n't appreciate any fibular venous distention . your heart is a regular rate and rhythm , no murmur . your lungs have some fine crackles in them , bilaterally . and you have trace lower extremity edema in both legs . so , what that means , essentially , is that you may have some extra fluid on board , um , from eating salty foods- [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Reassessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] . along with this history of your congestive heart failure . but , let's go ahead and look at some of your results . hey , dragon , show me the ecg . so , this is , uh , a s- a stable ecg for you . this basically shows that you have some left ventricular hypertrophy which caused your congestive heart failure . um , let's go ahead and review your echocardiogram . hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram . so , in reviewing the results of your echocardiogram , it shows that your pumping function of your heart is a little low , uh , but it's stable . and , you know , i think that we know this and we have you on the appropriate- [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] medication therapy . and then , i just wan na be reminded about , um , the results of your skin biopsy . hey , dragon , show me the skin biopsy results . okay . and in reviewing the pathology report for your skin cancer- [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] . you know , it looks like they got all of that and everything's fine . [Patient] yep .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so , you know , my impression of you at this time , for the shortness of breath that you had in the emergency department , i think it was an exacerbation of your heart failure . and you probably had some , what we call , dietary indiscretion , you ate some salty food which made you retain some fluid . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP]","231":"[Conversation Start][SEP][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] patient is pamela cook . medical record number is 123546 . she's a 36-year-old female post bilateral reduction mammoplasty on 10-10 20-20 . hey , how are you ?

[Patient] no[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven . four we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going [Patient] i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all [Patient] yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time[SEP]","237":"[Other Socials][Doctor] okay okay alright and how are you doing as far as like just emotionally and mentally how are you doing i'm just talking a little bit about your support systems [Patient] the nursing staff and the office has been very good to help you know with anything that i need as far as support so just since we are just getting started so far on the journey i do feel like i have support and mentally you know still feel strong[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay and how about with family or friends have you been able to turn to anyone [Patient] i do have good family members that have been supportive and they have come to my treatment with me[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay excellent excellent and so right now you're on a combination of two different chemotherapies the cisplestan as well as the eupside and you had your last treatment just a few days ago but you're saying right now you've been able to tolerate the nausea and the fatigue [Patient] yes i have n't had any nausea but you know just slight fatigue it does n't seem to be overwhelming[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Radiology Examination][Reassessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far [Patient] that sounds great thank you[SEP][Medication][Other Treatments][Reassessment][Doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss [Patient] great[SEP]","238":"[Physical Examination][Doctor] what if you move back a little bit ? [Patient] uh , that also hurts , doctor .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yeah , okay . [Patient] any kind of movement on my left shoulder actually hurts .[SEP][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay . all right , um , so let's ... hey , dragon . show me the last x-ray . all right , from the x-ray , it does n't look like there is any , uh , broken bone or fracture . my guess is you probably , um , hurt your joint , uh- [Patient] uh- .[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] . a little bit . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] so i would , uh , suggest you continue using the pain reliever , maybe just like 600 milligram of ibuprofen three times a day and use it for a week . [Patient] and for how long ? yes .[SEP]","239":"[Personal History][Doctor] okay alright so we'll do we'll do an exam on you just to check you out so i guess you were in pain and stuff over the over the easter easter break there that [Patient] yeah yeah i had some pain over the weekend i saw my pediatrician this morning so they sent me over here they were concerned that i might have a kidney stone[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay so i'm guessing you did n't get to go find the eggs on the easter egg hunt because of the you were in pain [Patient] not so much but i i got to participate a little bit i opened some eggs i just did n't go run around and find them[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay well i i'm lucky enough my friends had an adult easter hag hunt for me and so i was able to find a couple eggs yesterday myself so i i'm glad you were able to get a few of them alright so let's do that that physical exam on you so your vitals look good you do n't have any fever your blood pressure heart rate is fine so when i press here on your belly does that hurt [Patient] a little bit yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Reassessment][Doctor] a little bit alright so on your exam of your abdomen there is mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there's no rebound or guarding there is cva located near your flank tenderness on the right so that means that everything looks good but you do have what seems to be some inflammation of your kidney okay so we we were able to get a ct of your your side and it showed that you do have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size and it's located in the proximal right ureter and so that's that duck that passes from your kidney to your bladder alright i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so that means that there's not obstructing ureter causing swelling in your kidney which is which is pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone on the right so what i'm recommending is i want you to push fluids just to help facilitate you passing that stone alright have you been taking in have you been drinking enough water do you think so far [Patient] probably not enough i drink some but[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay yeah i i want you to to drink try drink as much as possible just to see if we can get you hydrated and pass the stone what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na prescribe you ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you can take that as needed for pain i know you said you were in that much pain just in case it does start to move you're in pain i want you to take the ibuprofen i'm also gon na give you a strainer for you to strain your pee so we can see you wan na know when that that stone does pass gon na order a bmp and a urinalysis and a urine culture and based on what the urinalysis shows we can decide if i can decide if i need to put you on antibiotics if you do have an infection of some kind and i wan na see you back in about a week to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we can discuss further treatment such as a lithotripsy and it's it's a mainly minimally invasive procedure where we use shock waves to try to break up that stone but otherwise do you have any other questions for me [Patient] no i do n't think so[SEP]","240":"[Personal History][Doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense . [Patient Guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wow . okay . [Patient Guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .[SEP]","241":"[Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so tell me what brings you in today . [Patient] recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] or how have you been feeling in general with this ? [Patient] not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . are there any other symptoms ? [Patient] i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ? [Patient] yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ? [Patient] well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .[SEP]","242":"[Personal History][Doctor] okay . all right . and then from a congestive heart failure standpoint , are you watching your diet , you're watching your salt intake ? [Patient] yeah . i've been doing really well with that . i've been staying away from the french fries , and all the other salty foods that i love to eat , uh , and everything looks great .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] um , so , french fries are one of my favorite foods , that and fried chicken , so- i give you a lot of credit for staying away from french fries .

we'll hopefully get you feeling better here and get you back out on the court and out on the course and we'll talk about that but let's let me ask you about your diabetes a little bit a little bit here so how have your blood sugars been running mark have they been what in the low one hundreds two hundreds where are they [Patient] they are like one fifty one sixty you know we just had easter and my kids got a whole bunch of candies so i keep eating that[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] hmmm okay yeah yeah understood so those cadboy eggs they'll get you every time too right [Patient] yes[SEP]","291":"[Personal History][Doctor] and how are the numbers looking [Patient] they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that [Patient] no[SEP][Discussion][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Reassessment][Doctor] okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home [Patient] i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Referral][Medication][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or get you referred to the er if needed any questions

look really good so you know i had them do an lumbar spine x-ray on you before i saw you and i looked at the results of your lumbar spine x-ray which showed no acute bony abnormality you know there was no fracture of your back or anything which is not surprising based on your history so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so i do believe it sounds like you have an acute disk herniation now this did happen a few months ago but it sounds like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having symptoms [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Referral][Doctor] i do wan na go ahead and order a a lumbar spine mri to get a a a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they do n't show us any of the soft tissue so let's go ahead and order the lumbar spine mri i wan na continue with physical therapy so i'm going to refer you to a a physical therapist through our health system [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Medication][Doctor] and then i also wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] to help with that do you have any questions about that [Patient] no questions[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] now if you do have a herniated disk we can go ahead and talk about some other treatment options maybe like an epidural steroid injection to help take down some of that inflammation [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP]","303":"[Personal History][Doctor] yeah and that can happen and one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods which is you know kind of the the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food and has that been difficult since you are watching your carb intake [Patient] the fatty food it is a little bit difficult you know i like those pork grinds and you know i i've had to kind of cut those out they were a nice staple for me when i was on the keto diet but i have cut out the those pork rinses because those were just so delicious and you know i would say it's a little bit better but i still get that pain[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay and then do you have any family history of gallbladder disease [Patient] yeah but you know you know i knew that was coming both my dad and my mother both had

that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better [Patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs [Patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] that's okay [Patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] absolutely [Patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them[SEP]","305":"[Conversation Start][SEP][Greetings][Doctor] hi virginia how're you today [Patient] i'm good thanks how are you[SEP]","306":"[Chitchat][Doctor] i'd like to tell dax a

expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary [Patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this [Patient] okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress

Examination][Doctor] good . well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind . [Patient] sure .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ? [Patient] okay , that's fine .[SEP][Physical Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation . there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam . okay , you can sit up . um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about . uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further . [Patient] okay , i should n't worry too much then ?[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Other Treatments][Doctor] so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision . [Patient] okay , that is fine with me , i ca n't see back there anyways .[SEP]","324":"[Personal History][Doctor] just kinda you're thinking walking the dog [Patient] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee [Patient] no no i have n't would you recommend that[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it's pretty bad [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] we'll get we'll get to that too [Patient] okay[SEP]","325":"[Reassessment][Diagnostic Testing][Medication][Doctor] for your next problem , your diabetes . y-you know , i think it's a little under- out of control . so i want to increase the metformin to 1000 mg twice a day . and i'm going to um ... um ... i'm going to repeat a hemoglobin a1c in about 6 months , okay ?

heart was pretty normal when i saw from the hospital your ejection fraction that's the pumping function of your heart was at about fifty percent which is you know low normal but not bad so that's good so okay just i would just watch your salt intake okay [Patient] okay yeah i've been eating a lot of vegetables and and chicken without salt on it[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay great and then you know i i'm i'm glad that you're taking it easy now remind me this might cause you some anxiety were the denver denver nuggets swept or did they end up winning are they still in the nba playoffs i forget i

to sweep the nuts no one no one likes them[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Radiology Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] no one likes them okay well let's i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your blood pressure here in the office your blood pressure looks good it's about one twenty seven over sixty which is pretty good on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention there is no carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally and on your musculoskeletal exam your right radial artery cardiac cath site is clean dry and intact there is no hematoma and there is a palpable radial pulse now what does that mean betty so all of that means is that you know you have a little bit of a heart murmur after having the heart attack but i looked on the echocardiogram and it showed that you know you do have mild mitral regurgitation which is just you know a little floppy valve which is is fine we'll just keep an eye on that and then everything else for the most part looks good so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of your inferior myocardial myocardial infarction i wan na go ahead and continue with your aspirin continue on your brilinta you're gon na stay on the brilinta for at least one year and aspirin you're gon na take lifelong until i tell you to okay i wan na go ahead and have you continue on the crestor forty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and put in another echocardiogram for about six months okay do you have any questions about that [Patient] yeah do you think i can no that sounds good i have one other more question though[SEP]","347":"[Chitchat][Doctor] yeah that's exactly what it is [Patient] interesting cool[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so hopefully i mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this [Patient] i'm excited[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks it's not not a major procedure and you should heal in the next two weeks so that wo n't be a problem especially considering that you're expecting a newborn soon we want to make sure you're all healed for that [Patient] wow i did n't even say that[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i read it in your chart [Patient] man you doctors are good[SEP]","348":"[Therapeutic History][Doctor] that's not too bad you might have a little white coat syndrome you seeing me today because it's a little bit high today so you're on that two . five of norvasc have you been taking that [Patient] yes[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay that's good how about your diet how is that going i know you were having a little trouble before your sot intake was a little bit high [Patient] i think i'm doing okay so[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] alright so as far as your diabetes your last time you came in let's say look at your a1c result it was a seven . two you were on the five hundred of metformin so what have your blood sugars been running [Patient] i do n't really check them[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Vegetative History][Doctor] you do n't check them okay so yeah we can get a a glucose test today and and and just check those because that's something we want to do everyday you know just to make sure you're eating the correct amount and that your sugars are are in range to make sure that and also to make sure that our medication is is the right amount as well so we'll do that that glucose test at the end of your visit and we could see if we can adjust your medication or not so let's go ahead and do a physical exam on you so i just want to double check make sure are you having any chest pain [Patient] yeah yeah yeah on and off so it kinda comes with the elbow pain arm pain[SEP]","349":"[Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay well you're one of the lucky ones some of my my patients that play sports they sprain their ankle seems like every other week so good for you so for that that that ankle sprain i just want to keep i want you to keep your leg elevated when you're seated and i want you to continue to ice it you can ice it let's say five times a day for twenty minutes at a time just to help that swelling go down i'm gon na give you an air cast to help you stabilize the ankle so keep it from moving and then i'll give you crutches and so i want you to stay off that leg for about one to two days and then you can start walking on it as tolerated tolerated so how does that sound [Patient] it's alright[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] alright so do you have any questions for me [Patient] yeah like how long do you think it's gon na take for me to heal[SEP][Discussion][Reassessment][Doctor] i mean it should take a a couple of days i mean i think in a day or two you will be able to walk on it but still think it will be sore for the next couple of weeks you know your ankle sprain seems to be not the worst but it's kinda you know medium grade ankle sprain so as i would say about two to three weeks you should be back to normal you will see some of that bruising go away [Patient] yeah okay can i get a doctor's note[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] no because you need to go back to work because you work on the computer not running so [Patient] fine[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah you ca n't get a doctor's note so if you if i write a note i'm gon na tell your boss that you have to go to work [Patient] okay thanks[SEP]","350":"[Chitchat][Doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast . [Patient] okay . that's fine .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well . [Patient] right .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery . [Patient] okay . well , thank you for explaining that .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","351":"[Conversation Start][SEP][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] so hey christina good to see you today i see you're here you have a nonhealing foot ulcer well also looks like in my notes that you got some you've got type two diabetes and that probably the reason for your ear but ulcer not healing so how you doing today what's going on [Patient] doing pretty good except i ca n't get this ulcer to heal[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay how long has that wound been present [Patient] maybe about a year[SEP]","352":"[Therapeutic History][Doctor] uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ? [Patient] uh , i do take a blood pressure pill , and that's it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ? [Patient] uh , that's correct .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger . his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable now here ? [Patient] yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , how about here ? [Patient] um , there , it's not .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , not as bad ? [Patient] yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .[SEP]","353":"[Personal History][Doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice .

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted . [Patient] that's good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly . [Patient] what's that ?[SEP]","354":"[Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hi billy how are you doing the medical assistant told me that you have a cough today [Patient] yep i'm doing pretty good you know cough started about a week ago or so you know i just started bringing up some yellow stuff and not feeling the greatest the last two days though[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright so the cough started a week ago but you have have started feeling worse over the last two days correct [Patient] yep[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] alright now have you had any fevers [Patient] not that i remember i i feel warm but never really took my temperature[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] you feel warm okay alright any chills [Patient] no no chills you know just a little achy at times[SEP]","355":"[Discussion][Reassessment][Doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone . [Patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try . [Patient] all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room . [Patient] all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay . [Patient] all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon . [Patient] i'll definitely let you know if that happens .[SEP]","356":"[Vegetative History][Doctor] not ready to quit ? [Patient] no , not really .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] it's a bad combination .

[Patient] yeah , sounds good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] do you have enough refills ? [Patient] yeah , i think so .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one . [Patient] yes , i do .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well . [Patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?[SEP]","368":"[Personal History][Doctor] yeah i mean certainly it could be it is you know sometimes that medication can cause that so i'll i'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright so and your anything else bothering you today [Patient] no i'm we're doing okay i think[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] so let me examine you for a second i'm gon na go ahead and gabriel i'm gon na do my magic exam now let's pretend i i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings as i do my exam and so [Patient] these are like my video visit exams[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] exactly so your neck exam has no jvd there is no bruits that i can hear your lung exam no rales no wheezing on your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past so i'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam you do have some tenderness on the left paraspinal area right where i'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal you have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paraspinal area of your back when i palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam you do have this one plus nonpitting edema of your lower extremities which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign no signs of blood clot that's what that means so let me just review what you know explain what all this means so the back pain the first problem that you're here today for i think this is more of a muscular sprain i'm gon na recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory naprosyn five hundred five hundred milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it does n't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now i would start with that if that's okay with you any questions about that [Patient] no[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] okay for the diabetes the the second problem that we talked about today i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day why do n't we have you come back in about two weeks and we should have some of the results back and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that but right now we will continue the course and we will go from there okay for the high blood pressure you do have this one plus edema in your legs i'm gon na go ahead and order some blood work today i'm gon na go ahead and stop the norvasc and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide ten milligrams once a day and if that does n't get if the swelling does n't go away i'm gon na do some more testing for right now let's get some sort off with some cbc and a bmp i'm gon na check your kidney function i'm gon na get another ekg and also i'm gon na get a chest x-ray and we'll go from there but hopefully this will go away once we stop this medication since it started around that time okay okay and i think that's it anything else we forgot about do you need refills for

[Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . um , and what have you taken for the pain ? [Patient] uh , i took some tylenol . i took some ibuprofen .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] i tried ice . i tried heat , but nothing really worked .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and , h- how are you feeling now ? are you still in the same amount of pain ? [Patient] uh , by monday morning , it loosened up a little bit , but it's still pretty sore .[SEP]","391":"[Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and is it hurt- ... tender right around that area ? [Patient] yes , it is .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . can you flex it or can you bend it ? [Patient] it hurts when i do that , yeah .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . and go ahead and straighten out as much as you can . [Patient] that's about it .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] all right . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] so there's some swelling there . and how about , uh , can you move your fingers okay ? does that hurt ? [Patient] no , that's fine .[SEP]","392":"[Discussion][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that . [Patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you . [Patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine . [Patient] so the good one is good ?[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good .

[Patient] i understand .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion . [Patient] well , that's what i'm here for .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","398":"[Personal History][Doctor] okay . um , and , you know , i know that you've had a kidney transplant a few years ago . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] everything is okay with that ? [Patient] everything's been good and solid there .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and you're taking all of your auto , um , i- um , your immunosuppression medications ?

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Reassessment][Radiology Examination][Lab Examination][Doctor] hey , dragon , show me the creatinine . so , your kidney function looks really good . so , that's really promising after your transplant . hey , dragon , show me the ekg . and your ekg looks great , uh , perfectly normal , so that's good . um , so , my impression of you at this time ... , let me see your blood pressure . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","399":"[Family History][Doctor] okay now tell me is there any history at all of like maybe heart disease or sudden death you know like early early in those your family's years [Patient] well come to think of it i did have my my grandparents told me that that i had a cousin that died and and he was only like forty four or forty five[SEP][Physical Examination][Referral][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] okay well i'm sorry to hear that okay so that's that's helpful information though okay let's go ahead and do physical exam on you there julie i'm gon na go ahead and take a look at your vital signs looks like your blood pressure looks good so that's good now on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any murmur rubs or gallops on your lung exam your lungs are clear on your eye exam i do n't appreciate any zenthomas and also on your neck exam here there is no thyroid megaly so now on your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any hepatomegaly or splenomegaly why can i see these today so i reviewed the results of your cholesterol level and it was elevated at two ten so that's high so let me go ahead and tell you about my plan so for your problem of elevated cholesterol what we wan na do is you know the american academy of pediatrics actually recommends that all children be screened screened once you know they become between ages and nine and eleven and then again between ages seventeen and twenty so that's why you were screened okay so we do we yeah so we do this because studies have shown a link between high cholesterol and premature heart attacks so i wan na go ahead and order a full cholesterol panel there could be other reasons that could be causing the the high cholesterol but i'll go ahead also and check some glucose a complete metabolic panel some thyroid studies and liver panels and i wan na perform a genetic testing to see if this problem is familial or this is a secondary cause so we are also gon na go ahead i wan na follow up in a follow-up with a well balanced diet so including a variety of foods that are lower in saturated fat and sugars so i want you to follow that and i want you to meet a nutritionist and so who can give you information about what kind of foods to eat okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Follow-up][Other Treatments][Doctor] alright now i do want you to continue to be active and exercise so that's great especially that you know your bike riding so you keep that up that's a great thing and you're doing well with that so keep that up for you okay and then i wan na follow up with another cholesterol level in three to six months after you've met with the nutritionist and then and they've you know instituted those dietary changes [Patient] okay it sounds good[SEP]","400":"[Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line . [Patient] okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility . [Patient] okay , yeah , that sounds good .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breastfeed after a breast reduction , and the reason is the breast is made up of fat . and it's also made up of a gland . and the gland is what produces the milk . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated . [Patient] yeah . i do n't know if i'm interested in breastfeeding .[SEP]","401":"[Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [Patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .[SEP][Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [Patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .[SEP]","402":"[Personal History][Other Socials][Doctor] so- can you start at the beginning ? i know she's a twin , so are these your first two babies ? [Patient Guest] no , i have a son also who is nine . he also has autism .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] and when the twins were born , katherine , she was about 4 pounds , 8 ounces . and her twin was a bit smaller , at 3 pounds , 13 ounces . and when the twins were born , katherine , she was about 4 pounds , 8 ounces . and her twin was a bit smaller , at 3 pounds , 13 ounces .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] like preemie type stuff ? [Patient Guest] uh- . yeah . she just had a hard time regulating her temperature , but she did fine . she does have a gi doctor , because she has reflex really bad . she also had a dietician , who told us to take her off cow's milk . which we did . and then she has seen an allergist , and also a neurologist ... who diagnosed her with this syndrome , because she still does n't walk and she was n't sitting by herself a year old .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah . [Patient Guest] but so now she is crawling and she is trying to take steps , so think she's doing pretty good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] good . is she in therapy ? [Patient Guest] she is in therapy . she's in feeding therapy , occupational therapy , and also physical therapy .[SEP]","403":"[Other Socials][Doctor] okay that's that's that's that's good yeah we we definitely want you to to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you wo n't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though [Patient] it's very helpful you know as you can understand i'm just like devastated when i got this diagnosis and i'm just i'm just trying to figure everything out and but he is very good and my daughter is is very helpful too and i you know i think for the most part i'm very fortunate to have them[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so how how are you feeling on your chemo see you're on a combination of sysplatin and a topicide you had your last dose a few days ago any nausea any fatigue from that [Patient] i was a little nauseated and tired but i took the zofran that you prescribed and that seemed to help and you know i i got some rest it's it's it's been okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Medication][Therapeutic History][Radiology Examination][Reassessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay that's good so let me do a quick physical exam on you just gon na check your vitals here so your vitals are normal your pulse ox is okay so everything's good with that so i'm gon na feel your neck on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy no subclavicular adenopathy your heart exam regular rate and rhythm no murmur your lung exam so i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally that's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath so that could mean you have some fluid in there and that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis so i'm gon na look at your skin exam so on your skin exam on your chest i do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side and that could be due to that radiation sometimes patients do get a radiation burn and it's it'll get better with time especially once you're done with the the radiation treatment and on your extremity it there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me you did get a chest x-ray it looks like you do have mild radiation umitis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so your first diagnosis you know is is the lung cancer so we are gon na continue you on that chemo regimen on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses i think you're on forty five grade yep you're on that and then when the when the regimen's complete we'll do some more testing and hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor so that has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out so for your second diagnosis the radiation pneumonitis i'm gon na prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams one tablet a day for five days have you been on on a steroids before [Patient] no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Reassessment][Doctor] i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] alright so do you have any questions for me [Patient] no[SEP]","404":"[Acute

nita i'm i'm examining you now let's pretend i did my exam i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put it into my chart okay and i'll explain what those things mean so on my exam you've got no jvd there is no swelling in your neck no carotid bruits your lung exam you've got some rails and some rhonchi on on more on the right side i do n't hear any wheezing right now there is some diminished breath sounds in the right side as well on your heart exam you've got two over successolic ejection murmur you've had that in the past that's unchanged from before the rest regular rate and rhythm otherwise your belly exam is nice and soft on your extremity exam you've got one plus nonpitting edema on both of your lower extremities on your on your ankles no calf tenderness no negative homan sign so what does all this mean so basically you've got you know you've got some sort of infection or something going on in your lungs that i can hear right now the rest of your exam is pretty much stable it's unchanged from before so let's talk about what we what we should do about this so for the for the first problem with the shortness of breath the first thing i wan na do is go ahead and get a chest x-ray for you okay you've been coughing up blood i also wan na send you to the emergency department to get some blood testing done i'm worried about a blood clot or something else going on so i wan na get a cat scan of your chest as well so i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to the emergency department i'll call them and and have you head over that way they can get a chest x-ray and a cat scan and some blood work as well and then we'll evaluate why you're having the shortness of breath and why you're coughing up this blood okay and then depending on what they find you may need you know it could be as simple as a pneumonia or it could be something a little bit more serious we may have to get you know start you know depending on what you find we will get the right treatment started any questions about that or can you drive to the emergency department from here or is that okay [Patient] yeah i can bike no problem i have no

[Patient] well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] did they prescribe you any medications in the er ? [Patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . i see . [Patient] they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ? [Patient] uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ? [Patient] yes . with eating .[SEP]","449":"[Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . and even when i press lightly like this ? [Patient] yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ? [Patient] i'd say it's about the same .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good . [Patient] okay . good .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days . [Patient] well , since you mention anxiety , i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time this happened .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","450":"[Conversation Start][SEP][Greetings][Doctor] hi , stephanie . how are you ? [Patient] i'm doing okay . how are you ?[SEP]","451":"[Personal History][Doctor] great .

[Patient] uh yeah , that's right .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great . [Patient] good , that's a relief to hear .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though . [Patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?[SEP]","452":"[Conversation Start][SEP][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] alright julia so you've been coming to see me for a while now ever since you had an rca stent placed back in twenty eighteen but i see you're here for follow-up after an interior stemi where we had to put in another stent right so like how are you doing [Patient] well i mean it was a real shock for me i thought everything was fine after my last heart attack and then i just started having this horrible chest pain and it would n't go away so i went to the emergency room and yeah they told me i needed another stent[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wow so you were experiencing similar symptoms similar to what you had the first time [Patient] yeah yeah it was yeah it was bad it was just like the last time[SEP]","453":"[Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain [Patient] really nothing[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] does the ibuprofen work [Patient] at night you know during the day i'm more active so it it really does n't impact it because i just work through it but at night it does help me to settle down and sleep better[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there [Patient] no when it's up it's fine when it's down on the

lot of pain like i can move it but you know when i try to reach for something lifting anything and even like i do n't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder [Patient] it actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder it does n't go down anywhere[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go [Patient] it's pretty much all the time anytime i put any pressure on it like when i'm trying to sleep it hurts even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so i know you mentioned tylenol [Patient] so this time i have n't taken anything for it[SEP]","455":"[Vegetative History][Doctor] okay have you noticed any blood in your urine i know you've been draining probably take a good look at it has it been darker than usual [Patient] no not really not really darker[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay so have you had kidney stones before and then you said your father had them but [Patient] i've never had a kidney stone my dad had them a lot but i've never had one[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright so let me do a quick exam of you your vital signs look good i do n't see any fever or your blood pressure and heart rate are fine so let me do a quick physical exam let me press here on your belly so on your examination of your abdomen there is no tenderness to to pain to palpation of the abdomen there is no rebound or guarding there is cva there is tenderness on the right side so that means [Patient] i have a stroke[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] can you repeat that [Patient] i did i have a stroke[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Radiology Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] no no no no no so that means like everything is normal right but i feel like you you you have some tenderness and inflammation over your kidney so that has to be expected because you do have a kidney stone so i did review the results of your ct and it does show a stone that's measuring point five centimeters located in the proximal right ureter and that's that duct that classes from your your kidney to down to your bladder there is no evidence of hydronephrosis that would mean that the stone is obstruct obstructing the ureter causing swelling in the kidney so there is there is no evidence of that so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone so right now i'm gon na recommend that we we have you push fluids just to help facilitate you urinating and passing the stone i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours for pain and you can continue to take tylenol between that for any breakthrough pain and you already have a strainer so that's good continue to use that and we can see continue that until the stone hasses and i'm also gon na order a bmp and your urinalysis and urine culture just to make sure that everything else is okay with you and based on urinalysis we can see if we need to prescribe you antibiotics see if you have any type of infection i do want to see you back in about one to two weeks and hopefully by that time you you passed the stone but if not we can discuss further treatment lithotripsy it's like a shock wave kinda breaks up that stone it's not it's not that invasive procedure but we can just we can discuss that if it has n't passed in that one to two weeks that sound good [Patient] that sounds perfect dear too[SEP]","456":"[Greetings][Doctor] next patient is randy gutierrez . date of birth , 8\/10\/2020 . please use review of symptoms . all text to write .

[Patient] yeah , i agree there .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .

very high in sodium especially the fast foods so we'll have to talk about maybe they can look at you know some some diet changes as well so the other thing is for your for your blood sugar here i see that you know you're running a bit high as well it looks like you're like you're about one seventy this morning and i i i i assume that you were fasting last night is that right okay so that's that's a little higher than what we want it's not bad it's below two hundred but it's getting kinda close to the borderline from where our limit is so we will take we take a look at that and also we'll figure out what we can do with that as well alright so at this point how about are you how is how is work how is life it's been good otherwise how's the family [Patient] they are good i did eat a lot of my kids easter candy over the weekend so maybe that's why my sugar is high[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay alright great alright alright just just around easter okay not not too much during the the year hopefully [Patient] yeah i try[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Follow-up][Medication][Other Treatments][Acute Assessment][Doctor] well that's good so let's go ahead and do a physical exam on you real quick here okay and so i'm looking at your vital signs it looks like your blood pressure i we mentioned that today is pretty high your heart rate looks good it's with it's within normal limits here and then your oxygenation is fine so you did mention you did n't have any shortness of breath so that's good so let me just feel around your neck real quick here i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention on your neck exam i no carotid bruits so that's good let me go ahead and listen to your lungs and your heart here real quick alright so on your auscultation of your lungs they're clear bilaterally on your heart exam though i i do sense a two out of six systolic ejection murmur now that was also there last year so it has n't changed any so we'll just keep monitoring that one and then let me take a look at your extremities here real quick theresa so let me look at your hands you got a little bit of slight edema bilaterally on your upper extremities but let me look at your legs here okay so you have a one plus pitting edema noted here on your legs bilaterally so that means you're retaining a lot of that salt that you're eating unfortunately okay so so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan here so definitely what you're experiencing is some uncontrolled hypertension now most of the time you know it's multifactorial right it's your diet it could be the medication regimen if you're not following that and then it might be that we are gon na need to change the medication around and also change your diet but i would like to start with going ahead and i want to continue your current medication regimen today i do wan na really encourage that you do take that everyday maybe set a reminder like on your you know do you use your iphone a lot for your reminders and things maybe we can go ahead and do that get a reminder make sure that you take that everyday but with that i would like to go ahead and also monitor your blood pressure let's do it three times a week it can be much when we do it everyday but maybe three times a week do you have a blood pressure monitor at home [Patient] no[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay so i can recommend some really good ones nowadays that you can use at home and they're not that expensive and at least it'll give you some you know idea of what your blood pressure is running at and then i want you to come back like in a month because i wan na go ahead and see how your blood pressure is doing now that you know you're you you're taking your blood pressure medication everyday the other thing is i do wan na go ahead and have a nutritionist come and talk to you about you may maybe some dietary changes i'd like for you to start a \u2013 diet it's really to to help you know a lot of reduce a lot of that sodium intake when you're when you're when you're taking in your food so a nutritionist is gon na be able to help you figure out some foods that you know that you may like that you can actually use as an alternative besides the mcdonald's although you can have that once in a blue moon but you know not not too often okay [Patient] okay sounds good[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Reassessment][Doctor] great and then for your diabetes i wan na go ahead and let's go ahead and increase your your metformin to fifteen hundred milligrams i think all for that too i want you to go ahead and continue taking your blood sugars to make sure as as you normally would to make sure that you know that change in medication is is actually being effective alright do you have any other questions for me at this time [Patient] nope[SEP]","509":"[Discussion][Medication][Doctor] that we had too much , yeah . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco . [Patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day . [Patient] all right[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you . [Patient] okay , got it .[SEP][Follow-up][Doctor] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","510":"[Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .

[Patient] uh , no .[SEP]","536":"[Conversation Start][SEP]","537":"[Therapeutic History][Doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [Patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [Patient] yes yes that's the name of it[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [Patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [Patient] it does[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [Patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs[SEP]","538":"[Drug History][Doctor] okay and have you ever smoked before [Patient] i do smoke i smoke about one to two cigarettes per day i've cut down a lot but i'm just having a hard time kicking those less too[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah yeah and that that's something i've got to work on too because hep c along with smoking you know both of those are n't are n't good so hopefully we can help you out you know if your pcp has n't prescribe something for you already and possibly we can we can do that for you as well [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so do you have any other medical conditions [Patient] no i'm actually other than that i just had my physical and i'm not taking any medications no i'm i'm pretty good otherwise[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay and what conditions would you say run in your family [Patient] i have high blood pressure diabetes and depression[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay alright so let me go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good and on general appearance you appear to be in no distress no jaundice on the skin on your heart exam you have a nice regular rhythm rate regular rate and rhythm with a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur is appreciated on your lung exam your lungs are clear without wheezes rales or rhonchi on your abdominal exam bowel sounds are present your abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly yes let me i will change that one splenomegaly and on your muscle exam there is no gait disturbance or edema so i did we i was able to review your your results of your recent lab work and your hcv antibody test was positive so your your liver panel we did one of those and it showed an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so that's pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you do have hepatitis c so your initial labs were consistent with that hep c diagnosis and so you know i do n't know if you read much about hep c but hepatitis c is a viral infection that does affect your liver and you've most likely had it for several years now it it it most patients do n't see symptoms until years later so the next step that i would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work so that includes checking your hep c rna and your hcv genotype and i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and we will do that by ordering an ultrasound elasto elastography with this information we will we we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment right so how does that sound [Patient] i hmmm so i do have a wife and kids so should i be worried about them[SEP]","539":"[Personal History][Doctor] all right .

[Patient] yes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . can you think of anything that might have caused the chest pain ? did you wake up with it ? [Patient] no . it just it randomly . i tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it . they did a bunch of testing and did n't find anything .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ? [Patient] well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] did they prescribe you any medications in the er ? [Patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . i see .

[Patient] okay . good .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days . [Patient] well , since you mention anxiety , i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time this happened .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] so we could do an , uh , egd or upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis . but your symptoms occurred three months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes , so likely if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point ... by this point , and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor , uh , for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd . uh , with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option . but what do you think ? [Patient] i'd like to hold off on the egd and wait to see if i have more symptoms .[SEP][Follow-up][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] that sounds good . um , so you can call the office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we'll get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow up with me ... follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","575":"[Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ?

[Patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know . maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] got it . all right . [Patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all . um , maybe more if i try to overdo it .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ? [Patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago . before that i did n't notice anything at all .[SEP]","576":"[Conversation Start][SEP]","577":"[Conversation Start][SEP][Greetings][Doctor] hi , natalie . how are you ?

[Patient] yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] okay , and you can take it , but before you do , we want to try to reduce the triggers . uh , so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks .

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] that we had too much , yeah . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco . [Patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day . [Patient] all right[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .

okay no pain with extension either does it hurt while you're just standing here [Patient] yes[SEP]","672":"[Vegetative History][Doctor] okay what about when you're you're taking liquids are you able to take in both hydrocort liquids [Patient] i mean i definitely feel like over the weekend i have n't been taking it as much because it hurt so much but i i am able to i am able to drink and i've been taking ensure and things like that i had a milk shake[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay that's that's that's that's good yeah we we definitely want you to to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you wo n't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though [Patient] it's very helpful you know as you can understand i'm just like devastated when i got this diagnosis and i'm just i'm just trying to figure everything out and but he is very good and my daughter is is very helpful too and i you know i think for the most part i'm very fortunate to have them[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so how how are you feeling on your chemo see you're on a combination of sysplatin and a topicide you had your last dose a few days ago any nausea any fatigue from that [Patient] i was a little nauseated and tired but i took the zofran that you prescribed and that seemed to help and you know i i got some rest it's it's it's been okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Medication][Therapeutic History][Radiology Examination][Reassessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay that's good so let me do a quick physical exam on you just gon na check your vitals here so your vitals are normal your pulse ox is okay so everything's good with that so i'm gon na feel your neck on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy no subclavicular adenopathy your heart exam regular rate and rhythm no murmur your lung exam so i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally that's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath so that could mean you have some fluid in there and that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis so i'm gon na look at your skin exam so on your skin exam on your chest i do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side and that could be due to that radiation sometimes patients do get a radiation burn and it's it'll get better with time especially once you're done with the the radiation treatment and on your extremity it there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me you did get a chest x-ray it looks like you do have mild radiation umitis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so your first diagnosis you know is is the lung cancer so we are gon na continue you on that chemo regimen on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses i think you're on forty five grade yep you're on that and then when the when the regimen's complete we'll do some more testing and hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor so that has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out so for your second diagnosis the radiation pneumonitis i'm gon na prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams one tablet a day for five days have you been on on a steroids before [Patient] no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Reassessment][Doctor] i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay [Patient] okay[SEP]","673":"[Acute

[Patient Guest] all right . thank you .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine . you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well .

[Patient] uh , no .[SEP][Discussion][Reassessment][Doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone . [Patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try .

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . do you have any tenderness ?

[Patient] can i get a refill of that ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse .

[Patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","746":"[Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good . any problems ? [Patient] no , no problems , uh , just still the numbness on this side .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . that area of numbness will get smaller as the nerves that innervate the skin across the knee heal . [Patient] right . okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] so lem me take a look at your right knee . [Patient] sure .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , and relax for me . good . all right , and bend . good . that looks good . um , the incision looks nice .

[Patient] okay . i'm so happy with how the surgery went . i have no pain .[SEP]","747":"[Discussion][Medication][Doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better . [Patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse . [Patient] yeah , sure , sure .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good . [Patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have . [Patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?
