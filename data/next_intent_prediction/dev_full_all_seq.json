{"src":{"0":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey kyle it's nice to see you today can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in [Patient] yeah i went to see my pcp for a cough which they diagnosed as bronchitis but then they did that chest x-ray to make sure i did n't have pneumonia and they found this lung nodule i went for a cat scan that confirmed it and they referred me here to you i'm really nervous document[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay well first of all i'm i'm sorry that you're nervous and what we're gon na do is we're gon na partner together okay and i'm gon na be right by your side the whole time to hopefully make you a little less nervous and and recognize the fact that we're you're gon na have a big support team around you okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so let's talk a little bit about how long you've had that cough before you went to see your doctor [Patient] i you know off and on i've had it for about three months i first noticed it when i was loading some pay i have horses and i i bought you know four hundred bills a day and when i spent a day loading it and then it's i just started coughing a lot more i think around that time and after that i i i just got a cold so that's what sent me to my pcp now i i i do exercise i i do a lot of biking and i typically do n't get sick and my cough has gone away[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking i love to bike myself i've got a track seventy one hundred hybrid have you been on the the new trails they opened it was the old the old rail the old rail road right away they've opened that up it's like sixty miles of trails [Patient] i love that that road i just i i do n't like riding on the road so i prefer to do those rails the trails type[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah i love riding over there way we will we will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride [Patient] absolutely i'd love it[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] that'd be great so i see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time and and and what do you do to to take care of your ra [Patient] yeah it's it's it's fair you know arthritis never really goes away but i take methotrexate[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking [Patient] i stopped smoking probably about seven years ago[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that [Patient] no not at all[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies [Patient] no lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer but she is doing well now[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that [Patient] no no not not anything that i'm aware of[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Follow-up][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Drug History][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process [Patient] no i do n't think so i think i'll be okay i'm scared[SEP]","1":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] we're gon na go right to the front- . so when you touch that- hi , michelle , how are you ?

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Lab Examination][Doctor] hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . so i'm looking here at your vital signs . they look great . you do n't have a fever at that ... at this time , so that's really encouraging . i'm just gon na check you out , and , uh , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs and look for any rashes and let you know what i find , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , so on physical examination , you know , you do have some swelling of your , uh , elbow joints bilaterally . um , does it hurt when i touch them ?

[Patient] okay .[SEP]","2":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12\/27\/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ? [Patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad . [Patient] yes , that's correct .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ? [Patient] yeah , that sounds good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today . [Patient Guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense . [Patient Guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wow . okay . [Patient Guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ? [Patient Guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel . [Patient Guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mhm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ? [Patient Guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] got you . okay . [Patient Guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] hmm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Chitchat][Doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ? [Patient Guest] only pepcid .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ? [Patient Guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ? [Patient Guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ? [Patient Guest] yes , that is correct . he did .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ? [Patient Guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that . [Patient Guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care . [Patient Guest] you're welcome .[SEP]","3":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03\/04\/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ? [Patient] good morning .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller . [Patient] it's nice to meet you as well .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ? [Patient] that's correct .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ? [Patient] well , right now the hand is .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , that's good . [Patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , i see . [Patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm , okay . [Patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though . [Patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ? [Patient] uh , no .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ? [Patient] um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ? [Patient] well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ? [Patient] uh , yes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . like , in terms of gripping things ? [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] really ? [Patient] yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ? [Patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ? [Patient] uh , yep .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ? [Patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ? [Patient] yeah , just a little strain .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ? [Patient] uh , yes .[SEP][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off . [Patient] i see .[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ? [Patient] i think that sounds good to me .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list . [Patient] uh , no , i do n't .[SEP][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ? [Patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ? [Patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again . [Patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ? [Patient] well , my hand is still bothering me .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural . [Patient] okay . sounds good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards . [Patient] all right . is the mri today ?[SEP]","4":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] so tyler is a 56 -year-old male who presents today complaining of difficulty swallowing and has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure so tyler tell me what's going on with your swallowing problem [Patient] well it's just been something that i have noticed over the last you know four to five weeks it seems like something is always stuck in my throat and you know just i kinda go about my day and it kinda bothers me you know a little bit sometimes a little painful and when i try to eat it just seems like i have to i do n't know when it's something solid i kinda have to wash it down on occasion i i've never really fully choked but i have to admit that i've thought about potentially choking[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing [Patient] no coughing just kinda when i swallow it's all okay with liquids but when i kinda swallow you know like a bite of a sandwich sometimes it just feels like like i just need a little help pushing it down[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and is it more kind of a like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that [Patient] i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think it's probably more with solids[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids is there is there a temperature change any modification to that [Patient] it's really just about solids[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all [Patient] no[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay that so no vomiting blood no coughing up blood or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all [Patient] not that i want[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this [Patient] no[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven . four we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going [Patient] i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all [Patient] yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and how are the numbers looking [Patient] they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that [Patient] no[SEP][Discussion][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Reassessment][Doctor] okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home [Patient] i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Referral][Medication][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or get you referred to the er if needed any questions about that [Patient] no that sounds great[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] okay and for the diabetes i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c i'm gon na order some more blood work today we'll check a kidney function and i notice that you have not had an eye referral so i'm gon na also give you an eye referral to ophthalmology to check your eyes for your diabetic for your for any retinopathy continue the metformin i'll have you come back in about a month and that way we'll have the results back for the blood test if we need to make any adjustments we can but i i wan na see you back in about a month and i think that's it for that any questions about that [Patient] no[SEP]","5":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey betty how are you doing [Patient] i'm doing okay i just been really frustrated because with my asthma and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [Patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [Patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [Patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [Patient] yes yes that's the name of it[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [Patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [Patient] it does[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [Patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs[SEP]","6":"[Conversation

[Patient] yes , i am .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] hi . my name is dr. edwards . nice to meet you . [Patient] nice to meet you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] welcome to the gi specialty clinic . [Patient] thank you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] did you have any problems finding us ? [Patient] no , i've been here with my sister once before .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good . so how can i help you today ? uh , the referral i have is for abdominal pain and diarrhea . [Patient] right . so i've had ... i've been having this pain right here in my stomach , like right around here .[SEP]","7":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate . hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ? [Patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now . [Patient] yes . it's doing much better .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ? [Patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , that sounds good . [Patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ? [Patient] no , i'm not right now .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication . [Patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel . [Patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . [Patient] okay . i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? [Patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ? [Patient] twice a day .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ? [Patient] no , that's fine .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] how often are you using that one ? [Patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ? [Patient] i'm not .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ? [Patient] no wipes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ? [Patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ? [Patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk . [Patient] it is ? okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself . [Patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that . [Patient] yes , i did . thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it . [Patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] let's see . [Patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much . [Patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 . [Patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form . [Patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , mm-hmm . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else . [Patient] can you do the metro market ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find . [Patient] sure .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say . [Patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?[SEP]","8":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] karen nelson is a 3 -year-old female with no significant past medical history who comes in for evaluation of a new right eye twitch karen is accompanied by her father hi karen how are you [Patient] i'm okay i guess[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] hey dad how are you doing [Patient] hey doc i am okay yeah karen has been having this eye twitch i noticed a couple of weeks ago when i talked to her pediatrician and they told me to come see you[SEP]","9":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] good morning ms. reyes !

[Patient] not too bad . and yourself ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ? [Patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on . [Patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high . [Patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] typically , it does n't . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive . [Patient] yeah , that's what they said .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ... [Patient] hm .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] uh , they did n't do a ct scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ? [Patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm .

[Patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while .

miss christine , how are you doing today ? [Patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [Patient] yes , i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [Patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Other Socials][Doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [Patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 . [Patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yep , right here . [Patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [Patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .[SEP][Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [Patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [Patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , good . [Patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ? [Patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ... [Patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [Patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you . [Patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated . [Patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [Patient] okay , thank you . got it .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ? [Patient] no , not that i know of .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . [Patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ? [Patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay . we might give you some of that . [Patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ? [Patient] yes , i also do have that problem .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , sounds good . [Patient] great .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [Patient] okay , i will do that .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future . [Patient] okay , that's okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not . [Patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range . [Patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [Patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .[SEP][Personal History][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [Patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , this is much better . [Patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","35":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey , ms. hill . nice to see you .

[Patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [Patient] yes , i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [Patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Other Socials][Doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [Patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 . [Patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yep , right here . [Patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [Patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .[SEP][Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [Patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [Patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , good . [Patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ? [Patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ... [Patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [Patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you . [Patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated . [Patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [Patient] okay , thank you . got it .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ? [Patient] no , not that i know of .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . [Patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ? [Patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay . we might give you some of that . [Patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ? [Patient] yes , i also do have that problem .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that . [Patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .

[Patient] great .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [Patient] okay , i will do that .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future . [Patient] okay , that's okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not . [Patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range . [Patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [Patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .[SEP][Personal History][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .

[Patient] great .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .

[Patient] okay , that's okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not . [Patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range . [Patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [Patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .[SEP][Personal History][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [Patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , this is much better . [Patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [Patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [Patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [Patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started . [Patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] does that make sense ?

[Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] pes bursa nontender epicondyle nontender back of her knee nice and soft any pain back here [Patient] no i do n't think so[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay popliteal space is nontender how about over on this side [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay lateral side nontender skin she has got about a dime size little abrasions dry looks about a week week old right over the medial patella everything else looks good no scars okay how about can you straighten it out all the way [Patient] i can but sometimes it like hurts a little bit like it almost like it clicks[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yep that's good though full full extension how far can you bend it [Patient] all the way back[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay let's see [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good good and how about the other side let me see the left knee can you bend that one all the way back too [Patient] yeah that's fine[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay full full symmetric flexion no no deformities go ahead and just let it relax [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] valgus stress medial collateral ligament intact lateral collateral ligament intact okay so little kind of little laxity posterior drawer let me see the other let me see the other knee [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yeah so that that feels pretty much normal so she's got a about a one plus posterior drawer anterior drawer negative lachman negative good let's go ahead and just kinda bend and straighten for me [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good patellar patella tracks fine no crepitus alright let's go back to this medial side you're tender right there is that right [Patient] yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Physical Examination][Doctor] it's tender on the medial joint line but actually negative mcmurray negative lateral side negative mcmurray good so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts [Patient] yeah sometimes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like [Patient] walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] you actually no [Patient] yeah it hurts no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] what about you i mean are you real weak [Patient] no i would say i'm pretty strong[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] did you go to the gym [Patient] i go to the gym but i swim so the[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay i ca n't treat people like you you you you need to work harder [Patient] i quit complaining okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yes sir work harder [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] do you do you play sports in in college or high school [Patient] i did in high school[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids [Patient] no[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] just kinda you're thinking walking the dog [Patient] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee [Patient] no no i have n't would you recommend that[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it's pretty bad [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] we'll get we'll get to that too [Patient] okay[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today [Patient] yes[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay do i go into that to [Patient] yeah[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it [Patient] you're only cup of this[SEP][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Other Treatments][Doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Other Treatments][Doctor] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] does that make sense [Patient] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP]","51":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] brittany edwards , 07 , 1898 . she is a return visit for ibs with functional abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting . ms. edwards is a pleasant , 32-year-old female who was last seen in august of 2019 with flares of abdominal pain , who was diagnosed with irritable bowl that was treated with bentyl . she had a previous prescription for reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea . she was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement , such as citrucel , daily , probiotics to help with gas and bloating , bentyl up to four times daily for intestinal cramping , and stop reglan and use zofran as needed . neuromodulators such as elavil and buspar were discussed but not started . hello , how are you ? [Patient] i'm okay .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good . how have you been feeling ? [Patient] not so good .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah , so my nurse told me you have been going out to eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp . [Patient] yeah , i have .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that . [Patient] no , it does n't like it at all .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Drug History][Doctor] yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol . and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps , or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea . [Patient] i've been getting both .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . um , so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ? [Patient] i'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and are they soft stools or formed stools ? [Patient] um , they're formed .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and after you have gone out either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ? [Patient] yeah , i do .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Drug History][Doctor] okay . do you feel it's the food or the alcohol or both ? [Patient] uh , well usually we go to friday's restaurant . i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce . [Patient] but it normally does n't bother me .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ? [Patient] most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer patron , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . um , every now and again , i'll drink a martini .sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks , but it can be a variety of things .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ? [Patient] um , no . i guess i need to find a new drink .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and how is it during the week ? [Patient] like what i eat ?[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah , and with the diarrhea and abdomal- um , abdominal pain . [Patient] right now , i'm still having the cramping and sharp pains , so i've been avoiding heavy foods . i did have some fried chicken today , though .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and was everything all right after that ? [Patient] yeah , for the most part .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . remember , it's also the portion sizes . so i mean , if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay . you have to just really watch the portions . [Patient] okay , good . i ca n't go out- go without some fried chicken at least once in a while .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] sounds good . all right , well let's take a look at you today , and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions , and we will discuss once we have finished the exam . [Patient] sounds good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . all right . i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . all right , so if you could just lay back for me , and i'll examine your abdomen . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . do you have any tenderness ? [Patient] no , not really .[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Medication][Doctor] okay . so the abdomen is soft , non-tender . no masses or organomegaly . and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . all right . you can go ahead and sit up now . thank you . all right , so first i want you to try citrucel . it does come in a tablet . you should use it twice daily for regularity . then i would say , if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 milligrams . you can do one tablet before you eat , and then repeat up to four times daily . and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything . um , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later , and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine . [Patient] okay , that sounds good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . and so your bentyl , that's the anti-spasm medication , and i would take the higher dose . [Patient] can i get a refill of that ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse . [Patient] yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","52":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] hey sean nice to see you i heard you that you have some back pain [Patient] yeah it's nice to see you too it's been a while[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] when was your back surgery [Patient] it was in november of two thousand twenty[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] was that long ago [Patient] yes[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wow what happened what did they do [Patient] microdiscectomy my disk broke off and just wrapped around and connected to my spinal thecal sac[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] sounds horrible [Patient] it's not the poop sac though[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] that's good to know what kind of symptoms did you have with that [Patient] horrible pain down my leg in my back just horrible awful things that you can think of[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] horrible nerve pain it sounds like [Patient] i think so[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay did they give you any meds for that [Patient] they did i was highly highly dosed up on gabapentin[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] was that hard to withdraw from [Patient] yeah it was terrible sounds like yeah there is certainly take too much of that and then stop suddenly you can definitely have some some issues[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so you have left side low back pain [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] does anything make it better or worse [Patient] so my beautiful significant other always tells me to stretch and it always works.[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] she sounds smart . so stretching helps okay what about any physical activities do they make it worse [Patient] a lot of bending over[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] randomly okay so it hurt on the right side as well or just the left [Patient] depends on the day[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] is it right around where you had surgery [Patient] generally[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay did you try icing [Patient] no[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] hmmm did you try any pain meds [Patient] yep[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] what kind of pain meds did you [Patient] ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams a day[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] it's quite a high dose okay let me do a quick physical exam on your back here if you bend forward does that hurt [Patient] not right now but normally it would[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so no pain with flexion how about if you stand back up [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay no pain with extension either does it hurt while you're just standing here [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so pain when you're weightbearing does it hurt when i push right here on the left side [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] pain with palpation to the left side around the l5 how about on the right side [Patient] no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] no pain with palpation to the right side okay i'm just gon na push down on your feet can you push back up on my hands [Patient] yes[SEP][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Doctor] alright dorsiflexion is normal looks like that you have normal range of motion so that's good any pain down your legs [Patient] no[SEP]","53":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , james , how are you ?

heart attack back in twenty eighteen we put that stent in your right coronary artery i know that the pumping function of your heart was a little low you know that what we call that ejection fraction was about thirty five percent have you been watching your salt intake [Patient] yeah but you know it's been the holidays the last couple of weeks and you know i we've had a bunch of family get togethers and i i do n't think my diet has been everything it should have been[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright now have you noticed any swelling in your legs [Patient] yes definitely[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and are you taking the lasix now i know that we had increased it to about forty milligrams once a day are you taking it [Patient] yeah i take it everyday[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] you take it everyday okay do you notice that you're urinating any less recently [Patient] no it seems about the same[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright and do you feel short of breath at rest or is it mostly when you're just walking around [Patient] walking around stairs in particular walking quickly[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay and how about when you're sleeping at night are you able to lay flat or do you have to sit up a little bit [Patient] i gone from one pillow to two pillows[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright and do you ever wake up really short of breath does it ever wake you up [Patient] it did that six months ago it has not done that so far this time[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright now tell me a little bit about when was the last time you saw your nephrologist [Patient] about about a month ago[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay because as you know you know we we do talk about the fact that you have some kidney dysfunction about stage three so it's gon na be important for you to continue to follow up with your kidney doctor now are you how are you doing staying away from things like motrin and advil i know that you had had some knee pain in the past and you know how are you doing staying away from those medications [Patient] yeah everybody has told me not to use it so i do n't except when i have pretty bad pain i had an episode about a week ago some pain in my feet actually and i i had to take motrin to get rid of it so yeah i took motrin for a while and i stopped as quickly as i could[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay now are you able to take tylenol do you not feel any relief from tylenol when you take it [Patient] yeah tylenol's lovely it just is not very effective[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright yeah because i think we really want you to stay away from that those anti-inflammatories because that can make your kidney function worse and obviously you know we do n't wan na see you go on dialysis or anything like that so we'll have [Patient] mean neither[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] right so we'll have to you know really work on that now tell me a little bit about are you watching the potassium and stuff in your diet [Patient] nobody's really talked to me about that so[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay yeah so you want [Patient] i did n't know what high potassium foods are[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay i'm sorry i've never talked to you about that in the past i that's my fault so yeah so you wan na make sure you stay away from things like bananas oranges you know potatoes have lots of potassium that type of thing and so you know because with your kidney function you know that can cause your potassium levels to go up because you do n't get rid of the potassium as you should you know [Patient] something to eat[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] what's that [Patient] is there anything left is there anything left over that i ca n't eat[SEP][Referral][Other Treatments][Doctor] so yeah you can eat you know how about this how about we give you a a referral to a dietitian and they can help you with that [Patient] sounds good[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] now are you watching the nba playoff should i or should i not bring that up i is that a sensitive subject i mean i'm a self expand and and we did sweep the nuts so [Patient] yeah well i mean that's fan and i could n't sleep last night but you know[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay well maybe we should n't talk about [Patient] kinda used to it you know where they where the favorite to win and then like that[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah i know i i i will say i think jason tatum and jaylen brown paid played phenomenally so i do think that they help with the cell fix over the edge so but that's all we'll talk about that what's that [Patient] i said yeah too bad they did[SEP][Physical Examination][Medication][Other Treatments][Acute Assessment][Doctor] yeah alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you okay so you know looking at your vital signs here in the office you know your your blood pressure is about one thirty five over eighty so it's it's not too bad and maybe like to see it a little bit lower i'm just gon na be calling out my physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so on your neck exam i appreciate some jugular venous distention up to about nine centimeters there are no carotid bruits on your lung exam i do appreciate bibasilar crackles with occasional rhonchi that clears when you cough on your heart exam i do appreciate a three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate one to two plus pitting edema bilaterally so frank what does that mean all that means is that you have findings on you that suggest that you're retaining fluid now we'll have to talk a little bit about how we're going to address that okay so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you okay so for the for your first problem of your shortness of breath i do believe you're having a an acute heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and increase your lasix from forty milligrams a day to eighty milligrams a day and i want you to call me in two days and let me know how your weight has been with increasing the diuretic now if you start to have worsening shortness of breath before that i want you to yeah call me we may have to admit you to the hospital for some intravenous diuretics okay i also wan na go ahead and just obtain [Patient] salt on lasix all at once am i take it all at once or do i divide it up[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] how about you start taking the the increased dose in the morning and then we'll see how you do and if necessary i'll have to add a second dose in the afternoon that you can take around four o'clock in the afternoon i do n't want you to take it too late at night because then you will be going to the bathroom all night okay [Patient] that sounds correct[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] so i also want to go ahead and order a chest x-ray just to make sure that we are not missing anything else okay for your second problem of your coronary artery disease you know it sounds like you're doing well except for this heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and order another echocardiogram to check out that heart murmur that i hear on your physical exam just to make sure that that's not getting any worse and to make sure that the pumping function of your heart is stable and i'm gon na go ahead and call doctor white and let them know that i want you to be seen by them okay okay and then for your third problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i want you to go ahead and try to you know do n't please do n't take anymore motrin or advil i do want you to try to stick with tylenol and if you're still having a significant problem with with some pain i want you to call me and we'll talk about some alternative medications that we can use or therapies okay i will also want to go ahead and order a complete metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable does that sound okay [Patient] that sounds good do you have any idea what was going on with my foot pain before[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well how long have you been having it how long you've been having that foot pain [Patient] that's why i took the motrin it lasted you know four five days slowly went away[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it was in both of your feet [Patient] one[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] one and where in your foot was was it [Patient] just in front of the big toe[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] just in front of the big toe okay have you ever had a history of gout [Patient] nobody has told me about that[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] okay alright well it sounds like it could've been gout you know with your chronic kidneys chronic kidney disease it it's a possibility so for this possible gout flare for your fourth problem of your possible gout flare let's go ahead i wan na just go ahead and order a uric acid just to see and it's something that we can talk about there is an alternative medication that you can take with your kidney function that that would n't hurt it that would n't injure it any further and i think it would work just the same [Patient] okay[SEP]","69":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey anna good to see you today so i'm looking here in my notes says you have you're coming in today for some right ankle pain after a fall so can you tell me what happened how did you fall [Patient] yeah so i was taking out the trash last night and i ended up slipping on a patch of ice like and then when i fell i heard this pop and it just hurts[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so have you been able to walk on it at all or is it you know [Patient] at first no like my friend who was visiting thankfully had to help me get into the house and i you know and now i'm able to put like a little bit of weight on it but i'm i i'm still limping[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay well you know that's not good we'll we'll hopefully we can get you fixed up here so how much how much pain have you been in on a scale of one to ten with ten being the worst pain you ever felt [Patient] it's it's more like so when i first fell it was pretty bad but now it's it's at like a six you know like it's uncomfortable[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and how would you describe that pain is it a constant pain or is it only when you move the ankle [Patient] it's it's constant it's like a throbbing pain you know and like when i touch it it feels kinda warm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright yeah but yeah i can feel it here so it does feel a little bit warm so i said you've been in a little bit of pain so have you taken anything for it [Patient] well like last night i iced it and i kept it elevated you know i also took some ibuprofen last night and this morning[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] alright has the ibuprofen helped at all [Patient] not really[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright so i just want to know i know some of my patients they have like bad ankles where they hurt the ankles all the time but have you ever injured this ankle before [Patient] so you know in high school i used to play a lot of soccer but and and like i had other injuries but i've never injured like this particular ankle before but because i used to play like all the time i knew what i was supposed to do but this is i also knew that it was it was time to come in[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay yeah yeah definitely if you if you ca n't walk on it we definitely good thing that you came in today and we were able to see you so have you experienced any numbness in your foot at all [Patient] no no numbness and i do n't think i've had like any tingling or anything like that[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay that that's good yeah it sounds like you have sensation there so yeah that that's really good so let me do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals your blood pressure was one twenty over eighty which is good your heart rate your spo2 was ninety eight percent which is good that means you're you're getting all of your oxygen and so let me go ahead and look at your ankle real quick so when i press here does that hurt [Patient] yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright what about here [Patient] yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so looking at your ankle and your right ankle exam on the skin there is ecchymosis so you have that bruising which you can see of the lateral [Patient] malleolus[SEP][Physical Examination][Personal History][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] malleolus associated with swelling there is tenderness to palpation of the anterior laterally in the soft tissue there is no laxity on the anterior drawer and inversion stress there is no bony tenderness on palpation of the foot on your neurovascular exam of your right foot there your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch alright so we did get an x-ray of your ankle before you came in and luckily it's there is no fractures no bony abnormalities which is really good so let me talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for your right ankle pain your symptoms your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain have you sprained your ankle before most times people do the athletics play soccer it happens every so often but have you done that before [Patient] no i do n't think so[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay well you're one of the lucky ones some of my my patients that play sports they sprain their ankle seems like every other week so good for you so for that that that ankle sprain i just want to keep i want you to keep your leg elevated when you're seated and i want you to continue to ice it you can ice it let's say five times a day for twenty minutes at a time just to help that swelling go down i'm gon na give you an air cast to help you stabilize the ankle so keep it from moving and then i'll give you crutches and so i want you to stay off that leg for about one to two days and then you can start walking on it as tolerated tolerated so how does that sound [Patient] it's alright[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] alright so do you have any questions for me [Patient] yeah like how long do you think it's gon na take for me to heal[SEP][Discussion][Reassessment][Doctor] i mean it should take a a couple of days i mean i think in a day or two you will be able to walk on it but still think it will be sore for the next couple of weeks you know your ankle sprain seems to be not the worst but it's kinda you know medium grade ankle sprain so as i would say about two to three weeks you should be back to normal you will see some of that bruising go away [Patient] yeah okay can i get a doctor's note[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] no because you need to go back to work because you work on the computer not running so [Patient] fine[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah you ca n't get a doctor's note so if you if i write a note i'm gon na tell your boss that you have to go to work [Patient] okay thanks[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so i i would n't do that but yeah but otherwise if if if you continue to have pain after this week if you feel like it's not getting better please feel free to contact the office and we can get you back in and possibly do an mri if we you know need to [Patient] okay[SEP]","70":"[Conversation Start][Acute

[Patient] yes . that's right .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . perfect . let me just get logged in , here . have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ? [Patient] no , i have n't .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and how long have you been considering this ? [Patient] it's probably been about six or seven years . but i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure . [Patient] okay , that's reassuring .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah . so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having . and then i'll do a quick exam . [Patient] okay . that sounds good .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails . and , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ? [Patient] i have blue cross blue shield . well , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .[SEP][Discussion][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company . and what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not . but we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you'll be on the new plan ? [Patient] most likely july .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ? [Patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . i do have a lotta pain here and here . but i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not . it gets painful and builds up . so i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and in your neck and your upper back . and how long has this been going on ? would you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ? [Patient] i would say since i was in high school .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup . [Patient] yes . i do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often . i mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable . and the others are expensive in my size .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ? [Patient] no , i do not have any kids now . but we might plan to in the future .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ? [Patient] sometimes , yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating . [Patient] no , but they are always sweaty .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ? [Patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ? [Patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ? [Patient] mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ? [Patient] yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] congratulations . that's great . and then , um- [Patient] thank you .[SEP][Other Socials][Drug History][Doctor] . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ? [Patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast . [Patient] okay . that's fine .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well . [Patient] right .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery . [Patient] okay . well , thank you for explaining that .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line . [Patient] okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility . [Patient] okay , yeah , that sounds good .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breastfeed after a breast reduction , and the reason is the breast is made up of fat . and it's also made up of a gland . and the gland is what produces the milk . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated . [Patient] yeah . i do n't know if i'm interested in breastfeeding .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . um , the hormones of pregnancy , though , will change the breasts , so that's just something to be aware of , and i tell all younger patients that . [Patient] okay , yeah . absolutely .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you'll have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple . generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction . and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised , and then it just takes some time for that to go away . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] but other than that , you know , most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because the symptoms of the back pain , the neck pain , you can feel relief almost immediately . so do you have any questions , julia , about the process or anything like that ? [Patient] no , not really .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . and , i do think you're a good candidate for it . and i think you'll benefit from it as well . [Patient] good . i look forward to a relief .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] i think you just have to do it when you are ready , when you know that you feel like it's a good time , because it is a commitment , and you will have some activity restrictions for about six weeks after surgery , uh , no heavy lifting . and i do say no driving for two to three weeks . and the drains stay in , like i said , for about a week . [Patient] okay . well , i am ready as soon as my insurance is switched over .[SEP][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . well , i think from this point , if you want to , we can take photos today , while you're here . i have all the documentation now in the note about your symptoms , and that's what the insurance company is going to look for . so thank you for answering those questions . so once we have the new provider , we'll go ahead and get that submitted . and then , when they approve it , um , what the office will do , is they'll work with you on a surgery date , and then we'll meet again right before the surgery to answer any last minute questions and go over the instructions in more detail , things like that . [Patient] okay . well , i will notify the office as soon as i have the insurance information .[SEP]","85":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , joseph . how are you ?

[Patient] um , for the most part , but we have been traveling all over to different sports tournaments for the kids , so it was , uh , a weekend of , uh , eating on the go , crumby junk food , pizza , and did n't really stick to the diet , so that was a bit of an adjustment .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . all right . um , but , ha- ha- have you ... let's just talk about your review of systems . have you had any dizziness , lightheadedness , fever , chills ?

[Patient] no .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] any burning when you urinate ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] any joint pain or muscle aches ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] perfect . um , and then , i know that you have this history of a-fib , atrial fibrillation . have you felt your heart racing at all , recently ? [Patient] only when i'm really anxious . i , i feel it , um , pumping a little bit . but other than that i have n't .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . all right . and how are you doing with your reflux ? [Patient] i've been doing well . i've been taking the medication that you prescribed to me and that's been helping a lot .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , yeah . i see here you're on the protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so that's , you're doing well with that ? [Patient] yep .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . all right . so let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam . so , listening to you , um , look , or looking at you , you appear in no distress . your thyroid is a little enlarged , but non-tender . there's no carotid bruits , your heart is in irregular rate and rhythm , and your lungs are clear . your abdomen is nice and soft , and you have no edema in your lower extremities . let's go ahead and look at some of your test results . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Reassessment][Diagnostic Testing][Medication][Doctor] hey , dragon ? show me the blood sugar . hey , dragon ? show me the blood glucose . hey , dragon ? show me the hemoglobin a1c . okay , so i see here that both your blood sugar and your hemoglobin a1c are elevated . so your blood sugars have probably been running high for probably a few months . okay ? um , let's go ahead and look at some of your other results . hey , dragon ? show me the diabetes labs . yeah . okay . yeah , so , um , my impression of you at this time , um , for your high blood sugars , that you do have this diagnosis of diabetes . now , we're not sure if it's type i or type ii . even patients in , you know , in their mid-twenties can develop type i diabetes , so we're gon na go off and , we're gon na go ahead and , and send some labs to work that up . hey , dragon ? order a complete metabolic panel . and i'd like to start you on metformin , 500 milligrams , twice a day . that will help keep your blood sugars down . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Medication][Doctor] hey , dragon ? order metformin , 500 milligrams , twice a day . and then if some of the autoimmune labs that come back show that you have an autoimmune disorder , meaning that you would have type i diabetes , then we would have to go ahead and put you on insulin . but i'm gon na hold off until we have those results , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP]","98":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] patient's name is diana scott . date of birth , 12\/8\/1920 . the date of service is 7\/9\/2021 . this is a new patient note . good afternoon . how are you today ? [Patient] i'm good , thank you .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good . well , what brings you in to see me today ? [Patient] well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ? [Patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur . so of course , i'm worried as well .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ? [Patient] i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one . so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ? [Patient] no , i definitely do n't .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ? [Patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain . um , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ? [Patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ? [Patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know . maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] got it . all right . [Patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all . um , maybe more if i try to overdo it .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ? [Patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago . before that i did n't notice anything at all .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ? [Patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ? [Patient] yeah . so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and so how about any passing out at all ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , good . and how about irregular heartbeats ? do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ? [Patient] i do n't notice it at all .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ? [Patient] yeah , my ankles swell .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and how long has this been going on ? [Patient] um , i would say for probably six months . but it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ? [Patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] mm-hmm . okay . [Patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ? [Patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ? [Patient] i'm not really sure .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ? [Patient] yeah , you name it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ? [Patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment . [Patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke . but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay , i see . [Patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ? [Patient] correct .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . well , let's do a quick exam . [Patient] all right . sounds good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ? [Patient] no , i feel fine .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , great . all right . well , that is it for the exam . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] and i can order that for today . um , do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long . [Patient] yes , that's fine . i have time .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay , great . so we will complete that today , um , to assess your overall cardiac structure and function , as well as , uh , the valve view of where diseased . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Doctor] and some hospital outcomes and what we might suggest to fix that out , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called , um , aortic stenosis , and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open , um , quite fully . and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body , and that's called the aorta , into the rest of your body . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement , or we just call it tavr . and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve . [Patient] well , i would have to think about that . i'm not too sure i'd wan na do that , given my age of all .[SEP]","99":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] so hey christina good to see you today i see you're here you have a nonhealing foot ulcer well also looks like in my notes that you got some you've got type two diabetes and that probably the reason for your ear but ulcer not healing so how you doing today what's going on [Patient] doing pretty good except i ca n't get this ulcer to heal[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay how long has that wound been present [Patient] maybe about a year[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] a year well that that's a that's a a long time so when it started i guess did you have any trauma to the foot or did was it just all of a sudden [Patient] no trauma it just it seemed like a little blister and then i picked at it and it did get a little bit red and infected so i talked to my primary about it[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay when was the last time you were on antibiotics [Patient] it's probably been five months[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] five months alright do you remember which antibiotics you were on [Patient] keflex[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] keflex alright so kinda does your foot hurt or is it just just the [Patient] no pain but i do n't have much feeling in my foot[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] alright so you've got neuropathy yeah that that that makes sense with the the diabetes so have you had any other symptoms like a fever chills any drainage coming from it [Patient] lately there has been a lot more drainage and i just feel a little more tired[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay alright well that that sounds good so today is thursday so what do you have for the weekend [Patient] not too much i'll probably be walking around at the zoo on this ulcer all weekend and eating out and not doing anything my doctor wants me to do[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] no yeah i yeah i know you do have that diabetes i know your pcp probably would n't be excited about you you eating out and all that but you know hopefully we can we i can at least get your your foot a little bit better so your diabetes i know we talked a little bit earlier how is that going for you is it controlled you know what's your your blood sugars running [Patient] yeah they are running better than they were but they are still in the two hundreds so my doctor does n't like that my last a1c was about ten[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright yeah i i you probably definitely need to get back with your pcp about that because the a1c is is pretty high and i know he probably had you on some medication and insulin and metformin and insulin just to try to to get that lower but [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] you know we are here for your foot so let's let me take a look at that so we will do a quick exam of your foot so you do n't have any fever your vitals look good so on your your right foot exam i can see here you do have a one by two centimeter two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint i do see some yellow slough that's present with minimal granulation tissue you have no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there is n't any evidence of fluid collection i do n't see necrosis so there is no dead tissue around it there's no odor and i i do n't appreciate any bony exposure and does it hurt when i touch it here [Patient] no[SEP][Discussion][Radiology Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay so we did a x-ray of your right foot before you came in and it showed no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that there is no bone infection which is really good so let me just talk a little about my assessment and plan of your your foot so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer so what i'm gon na do is i'm going to order a abi or ankle brachial index and that's just to determine your blood supply just to see if we can actually heal that wound i know it's been there for about a year which is a pretty long time and so we just need to see if we can if you do have that blood flow just in case we need to to make other goals for that foot just to depend upon that i'm also gon na do a debridement here have you had that done before of the [Patient] yes i think so[SEP]","100":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi miss russell .

right[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen [Patient] this happened yesterday morning[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry [Patient] yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere [Patient] no not really[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay any numbness any tingling [Patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well [Patient] yeah it does[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like [Patient] not without extreme pain[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up [Patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt [Patient] yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright and then lateral as well [Patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist [Patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you [Patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down [Patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better[SEP][Physical Examination][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to [Patient] i'm sorry[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] pardon what [Patient] a what[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace [Patient] okay thank you[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay [Patient] when do i have to have the surgery[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] alright so what [Patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks [Patient] six weeks[SEP][Referral][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of [Patient] oof[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions [Patient] no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay how long is the vacation [Patient] it's only for like a couple weeks[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks [Patient] no vacation in a month[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do [Patient] that sounds good thank you[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] no problem bye [Patient] bye[SEP]","102":"[Conversation

[Patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [Patient] yes , i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [Patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Other Socials][Doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [Patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 . [Patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yep , right here . [Patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [Patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .[SEP][Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [Patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?

you had a recent diagnosis of stage three nonsmol cell lung cancer and so we are following up on your neo adevant chemotherapy so you can you tell me how you're doing today [Patient] yeah you know i'm i'm doing okay i have a little bit of some shortness of breath that i noticed over the weekend and you know i i'm i considered myself pretty active before this i would walk my dog around the block and now i i ca n't even walk you know down the street without being short of breath[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay yeah yeah i mean that's that's definitely understandable it says you had a four point four centimeter left upper lobe nodule in there so it's kinda big but that's understandable and we're doing the chemo to try to reduce that that that tumor that you do have so how often do you normally run with your dogs [Patient] i mean i would i would take them for i would normally take them for like mile long walks everyday and just this weekend i could only walk down to the end of the street i had to have my husband take the dog fit walk[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] man okay what kind of dog do you have [Patient] i have a dobrman[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] yeah they are pretty active that makes sense alright so have you been coughing have you had any phlegm [Patient] i've been having a dry cough no phlegm[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay have you noticed any fever [Patient] no fever[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] no fever alright what about any other symptoms like any body aches any sore throat sinus pain [Patient] well i mean now that you mentioned it like every time i swallow it hurts it does n't feel like i have a cold because it hurts down here more in my chest but every time i swallow it it's really painful[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay so when you are swallowing i know some of my patients feel this do you feel like the food is getting stuck [Patient] no the food is not getting stuck it just hurts[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay what about when you're you're taking liquids are you able to take in both hydrocort liquids [Patient] i mean i definitely feel like over the weekend i have n't been taking it as much because it hurt so much but i i am able to i am able to drink and i've been taking ensure and things like that i had a milk shake[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay that's that's that's that's good yeah we we definitely want you to to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you wo n't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though [Patient] it's very helpful you know as you can understand i'm just like devastated when i got this diagnosis and i'm just i'm just trying to figure everything out and but he is very good and my daughter is is very helpful too and i you know i think for the most part i'm very fortunate to have them[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so how how are you feeling on your chemo see you're on a combination of sysplatin and a topicide you had your last dose a few days ago any nausea any fatigue from that [Patient] i was a little nauseated and tired but i took the zofran that you prescribed and that seemed to help and you know i i got some rest it's it's it's been okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Medication][Therapeutic History][Radiology Examination][Reassessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay that's good so let me do a quick physical exam on you just gon na check your vitals here so your vitals are normal your pulse ox is okay so everything's good with that so i'm gon na feel your neck on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy no subclavicular adenopathy your heart exam regular rate and rhythm no murmur your lung exam so i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally that's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath so that could mean you have some fluid in there and that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis so i'm gon na look at your skin exam so on your skin exam on your chest i do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side and that could be due to that radiation sometimes patients do get a radiation burn and it's it'll get better with time especially once you're done with the the radiation treatment and on your extremity it there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me you did get a chest x-ray it looks like you do have mild radiation umitis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so your first diagnosis you know is is the lung cancer so we are gon na continue you on that chemo regimen on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses i think you're on forty five grade yep you're on that and then when the when the regimen's complete we'll do some more testing and hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor so that has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out so for your second diagnosis the radiation pneumonitis i'm gon na prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams one tablet a day for five days have you been on on a steroids before [Patient] no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Reassessment][Doctor] i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] alright so do you have any questions for me [Patient] no[SEP][Follow-up][Doctor] alright so we will get you those medications those prescriptions and then we will see you back in two weeks [Patient] okay great thank you[SEP]","108":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal

slipped and and fell and i'm pretty sure i heard a pop[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and you said this happened yesterday correct [Patient] yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and have you been able to walk on it at all [Patient] no i was so initially when i first fell i was unable to walk at on it at all i had a friend that was visiting and so she heard me fall so she helped me inside now today i have been able to put a little bit more weight on it but i'm still limping[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and then what have you been doing for your foot or ankle pain since that happened [Patient] so i like iced it last night and kept it elevated and i also took some ibuprofen last night and this morning before coming in today[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and can you rate your pain for me [Patient] i would say right now it's like a four out of ten[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and does the ibuprofen help with that pain [Patient] it

had a lot of injuries to my ankle but i've never hurt this ankle before i just realized an error[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay you know and i see here that you have a history of playing sports looks like you played soccer in college and then played a little bit of a inner marrow soccer now [Patient] yeah[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] i'm i'm guessing you probably have n't been able to do that since you hurt your ankle [Patient] no i have not been[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] so did you hear about the new major league soccer stadium and team that's coming to town they opened in the this year actually they built the stadium have you been down there yet [Patient] no i have to get there[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah we are all excited it's going to be a good time well have you experienced any numbness or tingling in that right foot [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam your vitals look good and everything there looks okay now i'm gon na do a focused exam on your right ankle i do appreciate some ecchymosis or bruising over the lateral malleolus malleolus associated with some edema or swelling of that area you are positive for tenderness to palpation of the anterior lateral soft tissue and now i do n't appreciate any laxity on anterior drawer and inversion stress there is no bony tenderness on palpation to that foot or ankle area now on neurovascular exam of your right foot you have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch and all of that is consistent with what's present on your left side as well so i did review the results of your of your x-ray the x-ray of your right ankle showed no fracture which is a good thing so now let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for the first problem of right ankle pain your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain or i'm sorry right ankle sprain of your lateral ligament complex more specifically your anterior talofibular ligament now this ligament's on the outside of your ankle ankle which got stretched when you fell the best treatment at this time for your sprain is to keep your leg elevated when you're seated and let's continue to ice okay you're gon na be given an air cast which is gon na help stabilize that ankle and i'm also going to prescribe some crutches because i want you to stay off that leg and start walking on it stay off your leg for now and then in a couple of days start walking on it as tolerated do you have any questions or concerns for me [Patient] so how long do you think it'll take to heal[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] so your symptoms should significantly improve over a few weeks but i'd like to follow up with you and see how you're doing let's say i'll see you again in fourteen days now i do want you to go ahead and continue to take nsaids or ibuprofen as needed to help with any pain and that's also gon na help reduce that inflammation and swelling okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Follow-up][Doctor] alright i will see you again in two weeks carolyn [Patient] great thank you[SEP]","117":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] so hi zachary good to see you today so i'm looking

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants . [Patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain . [Patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ?

[Patient] that's good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly . [Patient] what's that ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon . [Patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged . [Patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?[SEP]","121":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Therapeutic History][Doctor] next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation . hi emily , how are you ?

[Patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?

[Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . all right . so , on your exam things look okay . so , i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distension or any carotid bruits on your neck exam . on your heart exam , i do appreciate a slight 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur . on your lung exam , i do appreciate some crackles , bilaterally , at the bases . and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate 1+ pitting edema . so what does all that mean ? so , i do think that you're retaining some fluid . it's probably from some of the dietary indiscretion . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] but i wan na go ahead and look at some of the results , okay ? i had the nurse do a chest x-ray on you before we came in , okay ? hey , dragon ? show me the test x-ray . so i reviewed the results of your chest x-ray and it looks good . there's no e- evidence of any airspace disease , but that does n't mean that you still ca n't be retaining some fluid , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP]","128":"[Conversation Start][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] . next patient is michelle king . date of birth : 05\/07\/1982 . please use toc template . she was admitted to district regional hospital on 06\/29\/2021 , and was discharged on 07\/02\/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to , uh , prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ? [Patient] not too bad . and yourself ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ? [Patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on . [Patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high . [Patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] typically , it does n't . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive . [Patient] yeah , that's what they said .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ... [Patient] hm .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] uh , they did n't do a ct scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ? [Patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in . [Patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , maybe that's all it was . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ? [Patient] yes , i am .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] great . so here are my thoughts . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ? [Patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ? [Patient] sure , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","129":"[Conversation Start][Chitchat][Doctor] i know the nurse told you about dax . [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you , okay ?

[Patient] i ... i'm pretty regular with the medications during the business week , but on there's weekends , you know , if i'm on the fly or doing something , sometimes i forget , or i forget to bring it with me . uh , but for the most part , it's been okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . all right . um , and then i know that you've had that prior lobectomy a couple years ago . any issues with shortness of breath with all the allergies or anything ?

[Patient] yes . on january 20th , 2020 .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ? [Patient] no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ? [Patient] sounds good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ? [Patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .[SEP][Personal History][Radiology Examination][Doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters . [Patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .[SEP][Personal History][Radiology Examination][Doctor] yep , definitely . based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ . [Patient] yes . unfortunately .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great ! [Patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ? [Patient] yes . fingers crossed .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you . [Patient] okay , sounds good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ? [Patient] i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ? [Patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . do you have children ? [Patient] i do . i have five .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice . [Patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i bet . sounds like fun . [Patient] it is .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ? [Patient] really , i did not .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ? [Patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those . [Patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ? [Patient] that's correct .[SEP]","136":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi dennis how are you today [Patient] good[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so what what brings you into the office i do n't believe i have ever seen you before here [Patient] the i'm training for a triathlon and the back of my heel hurts typically after a workout or when i first get up in the morning it will really hurt in the back of my heel all the way up into my calf[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay now tell me a little bit about this triathlon training what do you are you are you running far are you tell me kind of how you work out for that today [Patient] i i will run about ten klometers[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] wow that's that's a that's an aggressive campaign to get there so really hope you get that triathlon in so you're how many days a week does this occur that you're training [Patient] i i do that five days a week on the weekends i kinda alternate between you know a long run and a long bike do n't really do a long swim but[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay on your running days or when you do the running tell me a little bit about your stretching routine do you are you aggressive stretchers you do not stretch at all i know people that do both [Patient] yeah i do n't i do n't stretch at all i do n't have time for that[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay and i'm assuming that with the bicycle either you do n't really work the lower legs to get them stretched out you just jump on and go correct [Patient] yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay tell me a little bit about the pain is you said it it's after the activity but it you when you first wake up in the morning it it's it's there also [Patient] yeah when i first get out of bed it's just it just feels really tight and almost like it's tearing and i after i been walking around for about ten or fifteen minutes it eases up a little bit but if if i ever sit down for any extended period of time and then try to get back up it's really sore again[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] no go ahead go ahead [Patient] or after a lot of activity it'll get sore too[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay okay i'm sure this is impacting that ability to to really focus on your training uh as you're going with that with that type of a pain so lem me go ahead and let's let's take a look at your your and your lower extremities here and yeah okay so roll up your pants yeah okay good now does your left leg hurt at all do you get that severe pain or is it mainly on the right [Patient] no it's mainly just on the right[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na just hold your leg here and i want you to take your your foot and ankle and i want you to go ahead and just pull your your toes up towards you does that create some pain when you do that [Patient] yeah a little bit[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] a little bit okay now i'm just gon na hold your foot up and i want you to push against me and does that hurt [Patient] yeah that hurts a little bit too[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yeah okay okay roll over here on my my stretcher for me and i want you to dangle your your feet over the edge and what i wan na do is i just wan na i'm gon na squeeze your left calf first and when i do that does that hurt on your left side [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and i'm gon na squeeze on the right side anything there [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay okay well that's good your your thompson test is negative that's a really good finding and i just wan na continue pressing here on your right from your heel when i squeeze your heel does that cause significant pain at all [Patient] yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yeah okay and if i come up a little bit further as i i run up that achilles tendon does that hurt [Patient] that's real tender[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Referral][Acute Assessment][Doctor] yeah okay okay great not great so yeah go ahead and sit up for me so dennis my diagnosis is achilles tendinitis and it's really from overuse when we see this frequently when somebody starts to you know get in and train aggressively for an event i'm unfortunately i'm gon na have to ask you to stop training for a a week or two i know that's concerning but i really want this to heal before we move into that next phase i did n't ask you about medication but i'm assuming whatever you were doing was n't working significantly so what i'd like you to do is take some ibuprofen or advil that's the same medication and i want you to take three tablets every six hours and that's really an anti-inflammatory see if we can eliminate some of that tendinitis type pain that you're getting that inflammation around that achilles tendon i'm gon na also order a couple physical therapy visits and the reason for that is i'd like you to get some strength and stretching understanding i think it's important for you especially here at the beginning is to get some of that real stretching knowledge in and learn how to stretch those muscles before you start these activities and they are gon na help strengthen your your lower extremities also and i want you to come back to me within you know a week to ten days following your first couple physical therapy appointments so i can monitor how you're doing i see no reason for an x-ray at this point but if this continues we're gon na you know if you're still having pain ten days in significant pain without change modification of your activity then we may have to look at more aggressive treatment plans how does that sound for you [Patient] sounds good[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay hey did you happen to catch that pittsburgh pang one hockey game last night [Patient] no i i was watching the track meet[SEP]","137":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , brian . how are you ?

so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts [Patient] yeah sometimes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like [Patient] walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it [Patient]

high school[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids [Patient] no[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] just kinda you're thinking walking the dog [Patient] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee [Patient] no no i have n't would you recommend that[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it's pretty bad [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] we'll get we'll get to that too [Patient] okay[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today [Patient] yes[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay do i go into that to [Patient] yeah[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it [Patient] you're only cup of this[SEP][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Other Treatments][Doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Other Treatments][Doctor] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] does that make sense [Patient] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary [Patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this [Patient] okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right [Patient] okay alright i think that sounds good[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] did you get did you select you last night [Patient] i did[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] you yeah what do you think what do you roof for [Patient] i so i i'm a little heart broken right now i was for the

i'm not sure what they were though[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright and i see in your chart here that you had physical therapy did you feel that that was effective [Patient] no i feel like i could do them the same exercises at my house like they charged me and like it[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay but did the did the exercises help [Patient] i mean i guess a little[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay not a so not as effective as we would have liked did they put you on any pain medications [Patient] yeah it was just a white pill i'm not sure what it was[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay do n't worry i think i can look that up in your chart i just wan na make sure that we have the story straight alright so i know that you said that you mentioned that you played basketball you know before how how like what's your activity like now [Patient] i mean i sit at home all day[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay that's a pretty okay that's a pretty significant weight gain well i i just have a few more questions have you do you know if any of your family members have spine conditions [Patient] i think my fourth cousin has scoliosis[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay okay but that's that's a little distant but anybody direct like sister brother mom dad [Patient] i do n't think so i mean i do n't even my dad though[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay okay and then do you have a personal history of smoking [Patient] what type of smoking[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] any smoke you do n't have to tell me exactly but [Patient] okay[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] have you smoked [Patient] next maybe that i have n't[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] are you it's okay i'm your doctor i'm not here to judge you i just want to make sure that i'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you i need to know this information so one more time do you smoke or have you smoked before [Patient] okay i smoked[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it [Patient] i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay you have [Patient] too many questions are you the fit[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm your doctor i have to [Patient] are you the fence you sound like the fence next question[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Drug History][Doctor] okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things [Patient] sent them off yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] pardon [Patient] because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen[SEP][Physical Examination][Drug History][Doctor] you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt [Patient] yeah it hurts[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay and when you bend backward does it hurt [Patient] a little bit[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up [Patient] stop[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the [Patient] what does that mean like am i dying[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay [Patient] that's a big word[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Acute Assessment][Doctor] those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something [Patient] i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] alright [Patient] can i get pain pills too[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] can you [Patient] for pain[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] can you get what now [Patient] pain pills[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have [Patient] i'd say it was n't effective[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective [Patient] yeah i said i said the white ones i said they worked[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay i'm sorry so alright so maybe when let's okay so what we're still gon na do though we're gon na do the injection and then if it still hurts after that then we can explore that pain medication i do n't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication it's not necessarily like a good long term solution if after we monitor this you still are experiencing pain we are gon na try the pain meds however i would maybe recommend surgery [Patient] i do n't want i know[SEP]","147":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 . hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ? [Patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [Patient] yes , i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [Patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Other Socials][Doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [Patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 . [Patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yep , right here . [Patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [Patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .[SEP][Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [Patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [Patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , good . [Patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ? [Patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ... [Patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [Patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you . [Patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated . [Patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [Patient] okay , thank you . got it .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ? [Patient] no , not that i know of .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . [Patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ? [Patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay . we might give you some of that . [Patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ? [Patient] yes , i also do have that problem .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that . [Patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , sounds good . [Patient] great .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [Patient] okay , i will do that .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future . [Patient] okay , that's okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not . [Patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range . [Patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [Patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .[SEP][Personal History][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [Patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , this is much better . [Patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [Patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [Patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [Patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started . [Patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] does that make sense ? [Patient] yes , it does .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study . [Patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you . [Patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify . [Patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up . [Patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .[SEP]","148":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey kyle so i see here on your chart that you've been having some

pottery i've been creating you know i have a pottery wheel and i've been i love my pottery and for my son's birthday i've been making a a ceramic bowl and i'm gon na paint it and i have to do some real full decorations but i've really been working on it a lot and my gosh this is hurting and i ca n't work on it right now because it's hurting so much[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] i am so sorry so

that i recall[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and have you ever injured your elbow before [Patient] no i have n't[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright so on a on a scale of one to ten with ten being your arm is actively being sought off by a chainsaw how bad is the pain [Patient] well i'd say it's about a seven[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] wow that's pretty bad does it keep you up at night [Patient] yes it really does it's you know if i roll over and it it it just wakes me up[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you done anything to relieve the pain [Patient] well i have been taking some ibuprofen but that is n't really helping[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and have you tried anything like ice or heat or anything else [Patient] i tried a little bit of ice at first[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] but and it's just it's been hurting for about four days now[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay okay so it's probably it do you think it's getting worse [Patient] well it's just not getting better[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay no i understand okay so i know that you also have like a history of hypertension and that we have you on ten milligrams of lisinopril have you been checking your blood pressures regularly [Patient] yeah you know what i remember too i mean they they have been pretty good one teens to one thirties[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright and okay do you think that you've been good about taking your medications do you usually take them everyday [Patient] yeah pretty much i i i you know set an alarm for that lisinopril[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] awesome that's great alright and so i see that you also we are treating you for diabetes as well and that we have you on five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day how about that have you been taking that regularly [Patient] well sometimes i forget i mean having a medication twice a day you know sometimes i'm out doing stuff and i just forget to take it[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright so when you say a sweet tooth what are we talking about there [Patient] i love to bak also besides my ceramics i'm really big and baking and i like to make cakes and and take them to you know parties and get togethers you know family get togethers and i like to make senna rules too i've been doing that since i was very young so i kinda noticed that[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay cinnamon rolls can be kind of hard like do you for your cakes do you do you use fondant you know to like do any of the decorations [Patient] no i i mine are just pretty basic they're not overly fancy[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] so you know it's good [Patient] yeah[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] alright well so i totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family but we maybe wan na start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves is do you think that's something we could manage [Patient] yeah i know i need to get better on it i probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what i should and should n't eat how like if i need to combine a protein you know if i do eat something a little bit sweet maybe pling a protein or something with it[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a [Patient] had some friends tell me something about that[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah that sounds like a great idea and i think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice you know i do n't wan na as much as it's really helpful to have friends i do wan na be able to give you like a source of truth right [Patient] yeah i i had a diabetic consult a long time ago but yeah it it would be nice to see a dietitian again and go over those and maybe there is some new stuff too[SEP][Discussion][Physical Examination][Other Treatments][Doctor] a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay [Patient] yeah and can i ask you what word what were my vital signs can you show me what my vital signs were[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far [Patient] no that sounds good yeah i was just curious[SEP][Physical Examination][Other Socials][Doctor] mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on [Patient] well i do go for some walks in the evening i try to get one in on the morning too[SEP][Physical Examination][Other Socials][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] so not a whole lot other than that because i'm busy with my pottery or baking so but i do try to get out and walk daily[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay that's awesome so like how about about how long are your walks [Patient] well i just walk around the neighborhood there is you know the sidewalks and there is kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge and so it's probably you know maybe one to two miles a day[SEP]","157":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey brandon you know glad to see you in here

[Patient Guest] yeah , it's okay buddy .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over . [Patient Guest] dino , you're doing so good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down . [Patient Guest] hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like . [Patient Guest] all right . thank you .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine . you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well . [Patient Guest] okay . okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough . [Patient Guest] mm-hmm , got it .[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough . [Patient Guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine . [Patient Guest] okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yes , zarbee's . [Patient Guest] and then you said , uh , which medicine to give him just in case ?[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] right , does that make sense ? [Patient Guest] yeah , yeah . that makes sense .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay , great . and that way you do n't have to share , um , with his sister . [Patient Guest] right , okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] and since he's about half her size , we'll do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon . [Patient Guest] okay . will this information all be in the papers ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yes . and so , if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for five days . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is , \" as needed , \" or anything like that . [Patient Guest] mm-hmm , understood , thank you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] you're welcome . [Patient Guest] and the cradle cap ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] what i would do is use something like either head & shoulder's , or selsun blue , or nizoral ad . now , do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . um , cradle cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff . so , those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing 'cause they , um , they are all dead scales , and you still have to brush them off . so , continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil , or something that will help get the scales out , and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not every day , but maybe twice a week . so , two days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then , often , within six weeks or so , you'll notice that the-the cradle cap is just , um , not coming back anymore . but , he has to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes . so , just make sure when you're rinsing his hair you avoid his eyes . [Patient Guest] okay . okay .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] all right . and , if it keeps getting worse , definitely let us know . [Patient Guest] okay . sounds good .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] good . and , since they do n't have covid-19 , you can go right ahead and check out . [Patient Guest] okay . and both appointments in the week ?[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] correct . we'll see you all then . bye randy , feel better . [Patient Guest] all right , great . thank you so much .[SEP]","171":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] and good morning hi beverly [Patient] good morning[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] how do you see

[Patient] i'm good , how about you ?[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] well , how can i help you today ? [Patient] so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ? [Patient] um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ? [Patient] yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , i see that . [Patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] what do you do for a living ? [Patient] uh , i'm an x-ray tech .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ? [Patient] uh , i do take a blood pressure pill , and that's it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ? [Patient] uh , that's correct .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger . his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable now here ? [Patient] yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , how about here ? [Patient] um , there , it's not .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , not as bad ? [Patient] yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can . [Patient] my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ? [Patient] ow , .[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that . [Patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you . [Patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine . [Patient] so the good one is good ?[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley . [Patient] okay , all right .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone . [Patient] i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger . [Patient] all right , we'll give it a try .[SEP]","179":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi diane , how are you ?

cruz nice to see you today[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good to see you mister edwards tell me what's been going on [Patient] yeah so i've got this stabbing shooting pain i've had for a while you know and it it especially right here in my right face right in that cheek bone area it's sometimes it gets super hot i've had it for i think a couple of months now and i went to my family doctor and they said i should come see you[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay great i would like to ask you a little bit more about that had in your face do you remember how long that you had it [Patient] probably for about two or three months just just came on slowly i started noticing it but now it's i have episodes where just shooting stabbing kind of a pain in my right cheek bone right face area[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face [Patient] not that i've noticed no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face including the other side of your face [Patient] no it's just on the right side mostly not on the left side just on the right side of my face[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile or while you're doing other things any weakness there [Patient] not really i mean i've i've i've tried to you know when i smile my smile seems equal on both sides my eyes i do n't have any weakness there my vision seems to be unchanged but just this stabbing severe pain it's just like excruciating pain that i get sometimes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] does it happen on its own or there are certain things that trigger it [Patient] sometimes if i'm if certain temperatures seem to trigger it sometimes or if it's super where it's cold i get a trigger sometimes sometimes certain kind of sensory outside of the wind sometimes that seems to trigger it but that's about it[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and anything that you've done to to that helps for a little bit when you pain excess [Patient] you know i've tried ibuprofen and motrin that had really has n't helped it just comes on suddenly and then it's kinda stabbing excruciating pain i've tried rubbing some you know some tiger balm on it that did n't work but that's you know so i i went to my family doctor and he said you know i really need to see a neurosurgeon[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] got it how long do these episodes last these pain [Patient] you know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour but generally generally a few minutes[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know [Patient] no nothing like that[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches [Patient] i mean i get occasional headaches but not really i do n't have a history of migraines but i occasionally get headaches like everybody else i take some tylenol that usually goes away but this is different[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten [Patient] when it comes on it's like a ten it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick and but usually you know after a few minutes usually it goes away but sometimes it can last up to an hour[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] great . so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you [Patient] sure[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth . that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that [Patient] yep[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] you can hear it on the other side as well [Patient] yep[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay [Patient] yeah it's a little bit numb on my right side not so much on my left side[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal [Patient] it feels a little bit dull on my left on my right side my left side it feels sharp[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri [Patient] okay[SEP][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face [Patient] how do we treat it[SEP][Medication][Doctor] well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first . for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve [Patient] okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this [Patient] sure[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Medication][Doctor] it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you [Patient] okay sounds good let's do it[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain [Patient] yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not[SEP]","181":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi dennis how are you today

[Patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , i see . [Patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm , okay . [Patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though . [Patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ? [Patient] uh , no .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ?

[Patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ? [Patient] uh , yep .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ? [Patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ? [Patient] yeah , just a little strain .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ? [Patient] uh , yes .[SEP][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off . [Patient] i see .[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ? [Patient] i think that sounds good to me .[SEP]","189":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hi billy how are you what's been going on the medical assistant told me that you're having some difficulty urinating [Patient] yeah yeah i i did n't really wan na come in to talk about it's kinda weird but i think probably over the last six months i'm just not peeing right it just does n't seem to be normal[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay so let's talk a little bit about that now is your is your stream is your urination stream weak [Patient] yeah i'd probably say so[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and do you feel like you're emptying your bladder fully or do you feel like you still have some urine left in there when you when you finish [Patient] most of the times i'm okay but sometimes if i stand there long enough i i can kinda go a little bit more so it's taking a while actually to just go to the bathroom[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and are you waking up at night to go to the bathroom does it impact your sleep [Patient] yeah i try to empty my bladder now right before i go to bed and and not drink anything but i'm still probably getting up three or four times a night to go to the bed[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay so you're getting up about three or four times a night and and how long has this been going on you said for about six months [Patient] yeah six months to like this and it's probably been a little bit worse over the last six months and maybe it's been longer i just did n't want to bring it up[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay so you think it's been going on longer okay alright now how about have you had any burning when you urinate at all [Patient] no it i do n't think it burns[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] no burning when you urinate okay and and any other any other issues any problems with your bowels any constipation issues [Patient] hmmm no i i i had diarrhea last week but i think i ate something bad[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and ever have you ever had any issues where you had what we call urinary retention where you could n't pee and you needed to have like a catheter inserted [Patient] my gosh no[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] alright and have you ever seen a urologist i do n't think so you've been my patient for a while i do n't remember ever sending you but have you ever seen one [Patient] i do n't think so[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay now tell me how are you doing with your with your heart when was the last time you saw doctor moore the cardiologist i know that you had the the stent placed in your right coronary artery about what was that twenty eighteen [Patient] yeah sounds about right i think i just saw him in november he said everything was okay[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] he said everything was okay alright and so you have n't had any chest pain or shortness of breath you're still walking around doing your activities of daily living are you exercising [Patient] kind of[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] kind of okay now from what i remember i remember you being a big college football fan are you as excited as i am that georgia beat alabama in the national championships [Patient] yeah yeah i'm super excited[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] you do n't really seem that excited [Patient] get the problem fixed because i have to be able to sit there and watch the whole game[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah i i really do n't like nick saving i'm so i'm super happy that that the dogs pulled it out [Patient] i do n't know if we can do friends anymore[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] are you in alabama fan [Patient] maybe i'm actually originally not from georgia so[SEP]","190":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hello .

[Patient] correct . i've had the pain on and off for about two years . i finally went to the er and a ... a few months ago and they did a ct scan .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] i saw that . [Patient] yeah . they said they did n't really see anything on the scan .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] yes , i agree . it looked normal .

[Patient] nope .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] do you feel like you have more constipation or diarrhea ? [Patient] probably more constipation .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , so when you're constipated , do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard ? [Patient] i usually do n't go , but when i do , it's hard .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] and how often do you have a bowel movement when you are constipated ? [Patient] about three to four times a week . it's like when i need to go to the bathroom , if i can massage it , it feels like it's moving some and i can eventually go .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and when you have a bowel movement , does the pain change ? [Patient] yeah , it gets a little better .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] and are you eating and drinking okay ? any nausea or vomiting , heartburn or indigestion ? [Patient] none of that .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . so tell me about the diarrhea , how often do you get it ?

[Patient] it's usually just one time and then it's over .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] and how's your weight been ? any fluctuation ? [Patient] nice and pretty stable , although i could stand to lose about 25 pounds .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ? [Patient] not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even thought i've never been diagnosed with it .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi cancer or liver disease ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ? [Patient] i've never had any surgery .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all those are still intact ? [Patient] yup .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ? [Patient] no . i thought that happen when you turn 50 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well , that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy , like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants . [Patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain . [Patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ? [Patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ? [Patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ? [Patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ? [Patient] i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ? [Patient] hardly ever . maybe once a month .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] and do you consume alcohol ? [Patient] uh , yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay . and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice . [Patient] what would cause that ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted . [Patient] that's good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly . [Patient] what's that ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon . [Patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged . [Patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] correct . [Patient] so what does that mean ?[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged . [Patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ?[SEP][Medication][Acute Assessment][Doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that . [Patient] so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ?[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease . [Patient] so what do i need to do ?[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs . [Patient] okay . and then what ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too . [Patient] which medications ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ? [Patient] about 18 months .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives . [Patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ?[SEP]","194":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12\/27\/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ?

[Patient] uh , well usually we go to friday's restaurant . i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce . [Patient] but it normally does n't bother me .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ? [Patient] most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer patron , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . um , every now and again , i'll drink a martini .sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks , but it can be a variety of things .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ?

today what's going on [Patient] i was in my yard yesterday and i was raking leaves and i felt fine and then when i got into my house about two hours later my back started tightening up and i started getting pins and needles in my right foot[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] alright have you ever had this type of back pain before [Patient] i had it once about three years ago but it went away after a day[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and did you try anything for the pain yet did you take anything or have you have you tried icing [Patient] put some ice on it and i tried two advils and it did n't help[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay does it get better when you're laying down sitting standing [Patient] yeah i think the only thing that helped was a hot shower and it feels a little better when i sit[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay alright so you said you were raking leaves and now it's been kind of that weather outside for cleaning out the yard have you been doing a lot of yard work lately [Patient] i i i normally do n't do any physical activity[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yeah i hear you i make a i make my husband do all the yard work too so alright let me take a look at that low back if if you bend over does that hurt [Patient] it hurts a little bit when i bend over yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay how about when you stand back up [Patient] no pain[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so no pain on extension some pain on flexion how about when i push right here on your back [Patient] yeah that hurts[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so some pain to palpation right around the l5 can i have that [Patient] what happens when family members chime in like i'm doing right now because i actually think it was it hurts more when he stands up because i've watched him bend over but it's when he stands up that it really hurts[SEP]","201":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on [Patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta [Patient] yes and and fish oil[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that [Patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy[SEP][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so [Patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging [Patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then[SEP][Referral][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time [Patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack[SEP][Referral][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies [Patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking [Patient] i thought it was close to sixty[SEP][Other Treatments][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet [Patient] yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results[SEP][Personal History][Lab Examination][Doctor] i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist [Patient] oh[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] that's your kidney doctor [Patient] i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil [Patient] right yeah that's i threw all of those out[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span [Patient] i'm a more of a san francisco fan[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again [Patient] okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] you can take tylenol [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur on your heart which i've heard before in the past and it does n't it does n't look like you're retaining any fluid which is good but you do have a little puffiness in your legs which sometimes some of the medications can cause [Patient] yeah i do have that[SEP][Referral][Medication][Reassessment][Doctor] so let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and and plan for you going forward so for your first problem of your coronary artery disease i think you're doing really well i wan na go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in in exercising again okay and i am gon na go ahead and refill your metoprolol your crestor forty milligrams once a day as well as the aspirin okay i do n't think we need to proceed with a a stress test or anything at this time but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay for your [Patient] sounds really good[SEP][Referral][Reassessment][Doctor] good for your second problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i am gon na reach out to doctor miller and make an appointment for you to be seen just because again i think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Referral][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] and then for your third problem of your diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c and i'm gon na put that referral in for the dietitian to give you some dietary education and i'm gon na go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your your insulin regimen okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] any questions [Patient] yeah you know i've been kinda down ever since i had my heart attack is there any medication that i could take to make me feel a little bit less sad[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] yeah i mean are you having any thoughts of of harming yourself or harming others [Patient] no no i just feel kinda down[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you feel kinda down what's your [Patient] life sucks[SEP]","202":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] so beverly is a 53 -year-old female with a recent diagnosis of stage three nonsmile cell lung cancer who presents for follow-up during neo agit chemotherapy she was diagnosed with a four . four centimeter left upper lobe nodule biopsy was positive for adenocarcinoma molecular testing is pending at this time alright hello beverly how are you [Patient] i'm good today[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] you're good today yeah you've been going through a lot lately i know you just had your treatment how how are your symptoms [Patient] my symptoms are pretty good today i just kind of have a minimal cough and a sore throat[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and how about fatigue have you been feeling more tired [Patient] yes a little bit[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and how about any nausea or vomiting [Patient] no not as of today[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and i know you were mentioning a cough before how is it as far as walking are you having any shortness of breath [Patient] i have n't noticed any shortness of breath it just kind of seems to be a lingering kind of light dry cough[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] cough okay is it any mucus with it or is it a dry cough [Patient] more dry[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] a dry cough okay and tell me more about this sore throat [Patient] this kind of seems to be persistent comes and goes it will be worse sometimes and then others it feels better trying to drink lots of fluids[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and when you mention drinking and eating is do you feel like anything is getting stuck there [Patient] no i do n't feel like anything is getting stuck right now and i have n't been i have been eating but not as much as i normally would[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay okay alright and how are you doing as far as like just emotionally and mentally how are you doing i'm just talking a little bit about your support systems [Patient] the nursing staff and the office has been very good to help you know with anything that i need as far as support so just since we are just getting started so far on the journey i do feel like i have support and mentally you know still feel strong[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay and how about with family or friends have you been able to turn to anyone [Patient] i do have good family members that have been supportive and they have come to my treatment with me[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay excellent excellent and so right now you're on a combination of two different chemotherapies the cisplestan as well as the eupside and you had your last treatment just a few days ago but you're saying right now you've been able to tolerate the nausea and the fatigue [Patient] yes i have n't had any nausea but you know just slight fatigue it does n't seem to be overwhelming[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Radiology Examination][Reassessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far [Patient] that sounds great thank you[SEP][Medication][Other Treatments][Reassessment][Doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss [Patient] great[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay any questions for me [Patient] i do n't believe so at this time[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay alright so i'll see you at your next visit

[Patient] yeah , i've been pretty good with the diet , but with the pain i have been having, it has been easier to call and have something delivered. so i have been ordering a lot of take-out and fast food that can be delivered to my door so i don't have to go out and up and down the steps to get it myself. but other than that , it's been pretty good .[SEP]","216":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] hey linda good to see you today so looking here in my notes looks like you you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on [Patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go [Patient] it's constant[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright are you able to urinate [Patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes [Patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] third time alright [Patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever [Patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain [Patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved [Patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day [Patient] yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so we are getting close there [Patient] okay[SEP][Therapeutic History][Reassessment][Acute Assessment][Doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff [Patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running [Patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the the one eighties which was really high [Patient] right[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that [Patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries[SEP][Discussion][Chitchat][Doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help [Patient] yeah some help could be helpful[SEP][Reassessment][Referral][Medication][Doctor] okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright. so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday [Patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday [Patient] i do[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Physical Examination][Doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your

[Patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [Patient] yes , i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [Patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Other Socials][Doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [Patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 . [Patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yep , right here . [Patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [Patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .[SEP][Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [Patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [Patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , good . [Patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ? [Patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ... [Patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [Patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you . [Patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated . [Patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [Patient] okay , thank you . got it .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ? [Patient] no , not that i know of .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . [Patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ? [Patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay . we might give you some of that . [Patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ? [Patient] yes , i also do have that problem .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that . [Patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , sounds good . [Patient] great .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [Patient] okay , i will do that .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future . [Patient] okay , that's okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not . [Patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range . [Patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [Patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .[SEP][Personal History][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [Patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , this is much better . [Patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [Patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [Patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [Patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started . [Patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] does that make sense ? [Patient] yes , it does .[SEP]","223":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] and why is she here ? annual exam . okay . all right . hi , sarah . how are you ?

[Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] are , are you taking that ? [Patient] i am taking it . i think it's just a lot has been weighing on me lately .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . um , and do you feel like you need an increase in your dose , or do you ... what are you thinking ? do you think that you just need to deal with some stress or you wan na try a , a different , uh , medication or ... [Patient] i think the , the medication has helped me in the past , and maybe just increasing the dose might help me through this patch .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . all right . and , and what else has been going on with you ? i know that you've had this chronic back pain that we've been dealing with . how's that , how's that going ? [Patient] uh , i've been managing it . it's still , um , here nor there . just , just keeps , um , it really bothers me when i sit for long periods of time at , at my desk at work . so i have ... it helps when i get up and move , but it gets really stiff and it hurts when i sit down for long periods of time .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , and do you get any numbing or tingling down your legs or any pain down leg versus the other ? [Patient] a little bit of numbing , but nothing tingling or hurting down my legs .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , and does the , um , do those symptoms improve when you stand up or change position ? [Patient] yeah , it does .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . all right . and any weakness in , in your legs ? [Patient] no , no weakness , just , just the weird numbing . like , it's , like , almost like it's falling asleep on me .[SEP][Personal History][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and are you able to , um , do your activities of daily living ? do you exercise , go to the store , that type of thing ? [Patient] yeah , i am . it bothers me when i'm on my feet for too long and sitting too long , just the extremes of each end .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and i know that you've had a coronary artery bypass grafting at the young age of 27 , so how's that going ? [Patient] yeah , i had con- i had a congenital ... you know , i had a congenital artery when i was a baby , so , um , they had to do a cabg on me , um , fairly young in life , but i've been ... my heart's been doing , doing well , and arteries have been looking good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Lab Examination][Radiology Examination][Referral][Reassessment][Doctor] okay . all right , well , let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam . um , so looking at you , you do n't appear in any distress . um , your neck , there's no thyroid enlargement . uh , your heart i hear a three out of six , systolic ejection murmur , uh , that's stable . your lungs otherwise sound clear . your abdomen is soft , and you do have some pain to palpation of your lumbar spine . uh , and you've had decreased flexion of your back . uh , your lower extremity strength is good , and there's no edema . so let's go ahead and look at some of your results . hey , dragon , show me the ecg . okay , so that looks basically unchanged from last year , which is really good . hey , dragon , show me the lumbar spine x-ray . hey , dragon , show me the back x-ray . great . so this looks good . that's also stable from last year . okay . so let's go ahead and , you know , my , my plan for you at this time , you know , from a chronic back pain standpoint , if you need , um , you know , some more physical therapy , and i can refer you to physical therapy to help with those symptoms that are kind of lingering .

[Patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ? [Patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's the 250\/50 dose , correct ? [Patient] yes , correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ? [Patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ? [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ? [Patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ? [Patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no kidding , that's great . [Patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] really ? [Patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ? [Patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ? [Patient] probably about three or four .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ? [Patient] yes , that's correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ? [Patient] i do .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then . [Patient] nope .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ? [Patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ? [Patient] correct .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ? [Patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ? [Patient] yeah , that's right .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ? [Patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ? [Patient] yeah , it does , it works great .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ? [Patient] yep , that's correct .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ? [Patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it . [Patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ? [Patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment . [Patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point . [Patient] all right , that sounds good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","226":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , albert . how are you ?

'cause you're on so many other meds . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , is that something that you wan na revisit , or do you wan na look into therapy , or do you think anything's needed right now ? [Patient] uh , i think i probably wan na shy away from any therapy . my , my wife got me into meditation recently and , and , uh , i , i find that relaxing . so , i think i'd like to continue that , at least for a couple more months and see how it goes .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . all right . that sounds good . all right . well , i know the nurse did a quick review of systems with you , when you- [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] . checked in . do you have any symptoms , any chest pain or shortness of breath ?

travel history you've been on a plane or trip recently [Patient] i had some knee problem but there is no swelling but it hurts that's been going on for quite some time[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so that's not near the knee problem okay and have you had any have you been to the hospital or been to the emergency room or anything like that for your coughing and coughing up blood [Patient] no i tried to get an appointment in the office but they were kinda booked up[SEP]","231":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Therapeutic History][Doctor] next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation . hi emily , how are you ? [Patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ? [Patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's the 250\/50 dose , correct ? [Patient] yes , correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ? [Patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ? [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ? [Patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ? [Patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no kidding , that's great . [Patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] really ? [Patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ? [Patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ? [Patient] probably about three or four .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ? [Patient] yes , that's correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ? [Patient] i do .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then . [Patient] nope .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ? [Patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ? [Patient] correct .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ? [Patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ? [Patient] yeah , that's right .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ? [Patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ? [Patient] yeah , it does , it works great .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ? [Patient] yep , that's correct .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ? [Patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it . [Patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ? [Patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment . [Patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point . [Patient] all right , that sounds good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh . [Patient] ahh .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good . [Patient] awesome .[SEP][Physical Examination][Personal History][Doctor] so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ? [Patient] i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ? [Patient] correct .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use . [Patient] yeah i do know that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med . [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] that we had too much , yeah . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco . [Patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day . [Patient] all right[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you . [Patient] okay , got it .[SEP][Follow-up][Doctor] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ? [Patient] yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well . [Patient] awesome , thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ? [Patient] i just get it over the counter .[SEP]","232":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] patient is julia jones , date of birth 5\/16\/1996 . she is a new breast reduction consult . hello , how are you doing today ? i'm dr. gonzalez . it's nice to meet you . [Patient] nice to meet you , ma'am . how are you ?[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] i'm doing good , thank you . so you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ? [Patient] yes . that's right .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . perfect . let me just get logged in , here . have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ? [Patient] no , i have n't .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and how long have you been considering this ? [Patient] it's probably been about six or seven years . but i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure . [Patient] okay , that's reassuring .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah . so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having . and then i'll do a quick exam . [Patient] okay . that sounds good .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails . and , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ? [Patient] i have blue cross blue shield . well , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .[SEP][Discussion][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company . and what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not . but we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you'll be on the new plan ? [Patient] most likely july .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ? [Patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . i do have a lotta pain here and here . but i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not . it gets painful and builds up . so i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and in your neck and your upper back . and how long has this been going on ? would you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ? [Patient] i would say since i was in high school .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup . [Patient] yes . i do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often . i mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable . and the others are expensive in my size .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ? [Patient] no , i do not have any kids now . but we might plan to in the future .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ? [Patient] sometimes , yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating . [Patient] no , but they are always sweaty .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ? [Patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ? [Patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ? [Patient] mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ? [Patient] yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] congratulations . that's great . and then , um- [Patient] thank you .[SEP][Other Socials][Drug History][Doctor] . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ? [Patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast . [Patient] okay . that's fine .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well . [Patient] right .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery . [Patient] okay . well , thank you for explaining that .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line . [Patient] okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility . [Patient] okay , yeah , that sounds good .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breastfeed after a breast reduction , and the reason is the breast is made up of fat . and it's also made up of a gland . and the gland is what produces the milk . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated . [Patient] yeah . i do n't know if i'm interested in breastfeeding .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . um , the hormones of pregnancy , though , will change the breasts , so that's just something to be aware of , and i tell all younger patients that . [Patient] okay , yeah . absolutely .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you'll have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple . generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction . and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised , and then it just takes some time for that to go away . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] but other than that , you know , most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because the symptoms of the back pain , the neck pain , you can feel relief almost immediately . so do you have any questions , julia , about the process or anything like that ? [Patient] no , not really .[SEP]","233":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] karen nelson is a 3 -year-old female with no significant past medical history who comes in for evaluation of a new right eye twitch karen is accompanied by her father hi karen how are you [Patient] i'm okay i guess[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] hey dad how are you doing [Patient] hey doc i am okay yeah karen has been having this eye twitch i noticed a couple of weeks ago when i talked to her pediatrician and they told me to come see you[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright so karen have you felt the twitch [Patient] yeah well i mean i feel my face sometimes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah and do you have any pain when it happens [Patient] no it it does n't really hurt but i noticed that dad looks real nervous when it happens[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah i i i can understand that's because he loves you do you feel the urge to move your face [Patient] sometimes and then it moves and then i feel better[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay okay and so so dad how often are you seeing the twitch on karen [Patient] i do n't know i mean it varies sometimes i see it several times an hour and there is other days we do n't see it at all until sometimes late afternoon but we definitely notice it you know everyday for the last several weeks[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay so karen how is how is how is soccer [Patient] i like soccer[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] does she [Patient] she yeah she tries to kick me and she pulls my hair and[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] that is n't very nice you gon na have to show her that that's not very nice you're gon na have to teach her a lesson [Patient] yeah and and then sometimes after soccer we we go and i get mcdugge's and it and it's it makes for a nice day with dad[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] is that your favorite at mcdonald's in the the mcnuggates [Patient] not not really but they are cheap so[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay alright well you you made dad happy at least right [Patient] yeah that's what he says because i'm expensive because i want dresses and dogs and stuff all the time[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah well yeah who does n't well okay well hopefully we will get you you know squared away here so you can you know play your soccer and go shopping for dresses with dad so so dad tell me does the karen seem bothered or any other and have any other issues when this happens [Patient] no i mean when it happens she just continues playing or doing whatever she was doing when it happens[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright has she has she otherwise been feeling okay since this started has she been acting normally [Patient] i i'd say she seems fine i mean she has been eating well and playing with her friends and she goes about her normal activities really[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay good [Patient] never even though anything was going on[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright good so has has karen had any seizures in the past [Patient] no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] no okay and then so tell me when the twitch occurs do you ever notice any you know parts of her like moving or twitching [Patient] well no uh it's just her face[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay okay yeah that would be great to see that because i wan na see what's going on so thank you for that tell me is there any family history of seizures or like tourette's syndrome [Patient] well no history of seizures but i i i never heard of that tourette thing[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah so so toret is that it's a nervous system disorder that you know involves like repetitive movements or like unwanted sounds and it typically begins in childhood and i do n't know have you noticed anything like that with her when she was younger [Patient] really i had nobody in our family got anything like that[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay now tell me have you noticed any other symptoms how about like fever or chills [Patient] no[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay coughing headache [Patient] ma'am[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay how about any problems with karen's sleep [Patient] nope[SEP]","234":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] morning roy , how are you doing ?

[Patient] okay . so there are times when i'm either doing very , very mild exercises or just walking , even if i'm just walking up , you know , my driveway , i find myself palpitating a lot , and there's a little bit of shortness of breath .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] i do n't know if it's got to do with the back pain , you know , whether that gets triggered as well at the same time .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] right . [Patient] but definitely i feel it happens more often lately .[SEP][Personal History][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and anything else change recently ? like , have you changed lifestyle , like you're exercising more than you used to , having any allergies , anything like that ?

[Patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [Patient] yes , i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [Patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Other Socials][Doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [Patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 . [Patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yep , right here . [Patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [Patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .[SEP][Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [Patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [Patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , good . [Patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ? [Patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ... [Patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [Patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you . [Patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated . [Patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [Patient] okay , thank you . got it .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ? [Patient] no , not that i know of .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . [Patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ? [Patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay . we might give you some of that . [Patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ? [Patient] yes , i also do have that problem .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that . [Patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , sounds good . [Patient] great .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [Patient] okay , i will do that .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future . [Patient] okay , that's okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not . [Patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range . [Patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [Patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .[SEP][Personal History][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [Patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , this is much better . [Patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [Patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [Patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [Patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started . [Patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] does that make sense ? [Patient] yes , it does .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study . [Patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you . [Patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify . [Patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up . [Patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you . [Patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be . [Patient] okay , will do .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know . [Patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets . [Patient] okay , sounds good .[SEP][Medication][Other Treatments][Drug History][Doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ? [Patient] yes , that sounds great .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though . [Patient] okay , that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know . [Patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time . [Patient] okay , great , thank you so much .[SEP]","240":"[Conversation Start][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] . next patient is michelle king . date of birth : 05\/07\/1982 . please use toc template . she was admitted to district regional hospital on 06\/29\/2021 , and was discharged on 07\/02\/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to , uh , prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ? [Patient] not too bad . and yourself ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ? [Patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on . [Patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high . [Patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] typically , it does n't . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive . [Patient] yeah , that's what they said .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ... [Patient] hm .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] uh , they did n't do a ct scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ? [Patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in . [Patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , maybe that's all it was . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ? [Patient] yes , i am .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] great . so here are my thoughts . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ? [Patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ? [Patient] sure , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see . [Patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .[SEP]","241":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hi good afternoon joseph how are you doing today [Patient] i'm doing well but my my big toe hurts and it's a little red too but it really hurts okay how long has this been going on i would say you know off and on for about two weeks but last week is is when it really became painful i was at a a trade show convention and i could n't walk the halls i could n't do anything i just had to stand there and it really hurt the whole time i was there[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay does it throb ache burn what kind of pain do you get with it [Patient] it's almost like a throbbing pain but occasionally it becomes almost like a a sharp stabbing pain especially if i move it or spend too much time walking i i find myself walking on my heel just to keep that toe from bending[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay sorry i got a text and [Patient] well that's okay you know what i i you know i what i really you know i love to ride bikes have you you ride bike at all[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] no i hate riding a bike i'm more of a runner [Patient] my gosh i love to ride i ride the lot of rails the trails i mean i go all the last year i put in over eight hundred miles on rails the trails[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah those those are nice [Patient] yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] does it does riding your bike bother your big toe [Patient] no because i i kinda pedal with the the back of my feet you know on that side[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay do do you wear clips or are you just wearing a regular shoe and on a regular pedal [Patient] i'm on a regular shoe some most of the time i'm in my flip flops[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay okay the how is there anything that you were doing out of the ordinary when this started [Patient] no i do n't that's the thing i do n't remember an injury if it was something that i injured i think i would have just ignored it and would n't have showed up here but when it got red and warm to touch that's when i i was really concerned[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay do does even light pressure to it bother it like at night when you're laying in bed do the sheets bother [Patient] absolutely i was just gon na say when i'm in bed at night and those sheets come down on it or i roll over yeah that hurts a lot[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you done anything to try to get it to feel better any soaks or taking any medicine [Patient] i take you know like a two ibuprofen a day and that does n't seem to help[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let me see your your foot here and let me take your big toe through a range of motion if i push your top to bottom [Patient] yeah ouch[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] big toe joint that okay and let me move it up where as i bend it up does that hurt [Patient] it hurts but not as much as when you moved it down[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so i'm moving it down here and it i've got about ten degrees of plantar flexion does that hurt [Patient] yeah it a little when you take it a little further[SEP]","242":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] alright thanks for coming in today i see on my chart here that you had a bunch of lower respiratory infections so first tell me how are you what's going on [Patient] you know i'm doing better now but you know last week i was really sick and i just have had enough like i was coughing a lot a lot of mucus even had some shortness of breath and even a low-grade fever[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] wow that is a lot so what did you do for some of those symptoms [Patient] you know i ended up drinking a lot of fluid and taking some robitussin and i actually got better over the weekend and now i'm feeling much better but what concerns me is that i i tend to get pneumonia a lot[SEP]","243":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate . hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ? [Patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now . [Patient] yes . it's doing much better .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ? [Patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , that sounds good . [Patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ? [Patient] no , i'm not right now .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication . [Patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel . [Patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . [Patient] okay . i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? [Patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ? [Patient] twice a day .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ? [Patient] no , that's fine .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] how often are you using that one ? [Patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ? [Patient] i'm not .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ? [Patient] no wipes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ? [Patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ? [Patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk . [Patient] it is ? okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself . [Patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that . [Patient] yes , i did . thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it . [Patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] let's see . [Patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much . [Patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 . [Patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form . [Patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , mm-hmm . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else . [Patient] can you do the metro market ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find . [Patient] sure .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say . [Patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] correct , it's not a steroid . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad . [Patient] okay . got it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ? [Patient] okay , thank you for explaining .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so i will say , \" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . \" [Patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash. [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ? [Patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you . [Patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day . [Patient] that sounds good .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping . [Patient] okay , sounds good .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here . [Patient] thank you so much .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly . [Patient] sounds good .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream . [Patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .[SEP]","244":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] patient is pamela cook . medical record number is 123546 . she's a 36-year-old female post bilateral reduction mammoplasty on 10-10 20-20 . hey , how are you ?

hi andrea well i [Patient] hello[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] i understand you're you've come in with some right knee pain can you tell me about it what's going on [Patient] it it's not the right knee it's the left knee[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay the left knee [Patient] and it just happens occasionally less than once a day when i'm walking all of a sudden it is kind of like gives out and i think here i'm going to fall but i usually catch myself so lot of times i have to hold a grocery cart and that helps a lot so it comes and goes and it it passes just about as quickly as it comes i do n't know what it is whether i stepped wrong or i just do n't know[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay well so where does it hurt like in on the inside or the outside or [Patient] internally and it it just the whole kneecap fades[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay well did you hear or feel a pop at any point [Patient] no[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you ever had any type of injury to that knee i mean did you fall or bump it against something or [Patient] no not that i can recall[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and have is it painful have you taken anything for

function and probably be doing a lot of walking there and they got some line dances planned and i do n't think i will be able to participate in that because of the knee[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] is that where you would be kicking your leg out or something [Patient] no it's do n't you know what line dancing is like dancing in theories of fairly fast moves but it's mostly sideways motion[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] and is and that you think that's when your knee might give out then or just not gon na take the chance [Patient] not gon na take the chance[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay yeah that sounds like a good idea have you thought about even having a a cane just in case or do you think that's does that happen often enough [Patient]

here and it it does seem like i do hear a slight murmur with your heart here and i i do n't think we've we've heard that before so i think i'm gon na get an ekg as well because i'm concerned you might be having like a mild heart attack so because you have the pain all the way up your elbow that go into your neck and your your chest pain as well i do n't think it's it's it's musculoskeletal pain because you said you had n't done anything with it so far so what i wan na do is and let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan here so i i do think that you or you do have that chest pain i'm concerned that you know you might be having a mild heart attack i'm gon na get ekg for that we're also gon na get you some aspirin is a nitroglycerin just to see if that helps with that pain as far as your for your diabetes i want you we're gon na get that p oct glucose and we'll keep you on be five hundred of metformin for now and then for your hypertension we'll keep you on that two . five of of norvasc but i think our most immediate issue is the is the chest pain and so we'll do the ekg and depending upon those results we'll we'll call nine one one because we really need to get you to the hospital if that is the case so how does that sound [Patient] i do n't know i was talking to my brother and he's a he is a heart doctor and he kinda thought maybe it was n't the heart

injections before i'm not sure what they were though[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright and i see in your chart here that you had physical therapy did you feel that that was effective [Patient] no i feel like i could do them the same exercises at my house like they charged me and like it[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay but did the did the exercises help [Patient] i mean i guess a little[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay not a so not as effective as we would have liked did they put you on any pain medications [Patient] yeah it was just a white pill i'm not sure what it was[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay do n't worry i think i can look that up in your chart i just wan na make sure that we have the story straight alright so i know that you said that you mentioned that you played basketball you know before how how like what's your activity like now [Patient] i mean i sit at home all day[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay that's a pretty okay that's a pretty significant weight gain well i i just have a few more questions have you do you know if any of your family members have spine conditions [Patient] i think my fourth cousin has scoliosis[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay okay but that's that's a little distant but anybody direct like sister brother mom dad [Patient] i do n't think so i mean i do n't even my dad though[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay okay and then do you have a personal history of smoking [Patient] what type of smoking[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] any smoke you do n't have to tell me exactly but [Patient] okay[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] have you smoked [Patient] next maybe that i have n't[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] are you it's okay i'm your doctor i'm not here to judge you i just want to make sure that i'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you i need to know this information so one more time do you smoke or have you smoked before [Patient] okay i smoked[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it [Patient] i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay you have [Patient] too many questions are you the fit[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm your doctor i have to [Patient] are you the fence you sound like the fence next question[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Drug History][Doctor] okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things [Patient] sent them off yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] pardon [Patient] because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen[SEP][Physical Examination][Drug History][Doctor] you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt [Patient] yeah it hurts[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay and when you bend backward does it hurt [Patient] a little bit[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up [Patient] stop[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the [Patient] what does that mean like am i dying[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay [Patient] that's a big word[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Acute Assessment][Doctor] those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something [Patient] i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] alright [Patient] can i get pain pills too[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] can you [Patient] for pain[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] can you get what now [Patient] pain pills[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have [Patient] i'd say it was n't effective[SEP]","271":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Therapeutic History][Doctor] all right . this is matthew rogers . date of birth 5\/24\/2007 . i would like to use the acne

what's been going on with my headaches[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so i know you were sent here by your your pcp what was your understanding of why you were sent here [Patient] yeah so i actually have been someone who been struggling with headaches for years now ever since i was a teenager and they used to be around my when i would have my menstrual my menses but as i got older i noticed that it has been with that and also i can get it when i'm really stressed but recently and why i went to her is because my headaches have been getting a lot more they've just been happening a lot more frequently and a lot more severe[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay can you tell me a little bit about them what how do they how do they feel when they come on [Patient] so they say mostly on my right side and it even seems like it's like behind my eye and it just like this pulsing like this really bad pulsing sensation[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse i know you said they they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse [Patient] i i have noticed that you know i've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight but i ca n't even really exercise for very long because i start of as soon as i start to jog i my headaches the headaches come back on a lot worse so i notice it when i'm exercising[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches [Patient] i've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now and then what really scared me is that now i'm starting to get some blurred vision it's not all the time but it it will come and go but some blurred like on the in my on the side of my vision[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay okay and have you experienced any numbness or tingling to your hands or feet or your face [Patient] no i have n't[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay so you you like to run a lot what kind of do you do you use a a good shoe you know what kind of shoes do you use for your running [Patient] yeah i yeah i i'm starting to get back into it i'm a big new balance person in asics so yeah those are the two brands i like to wear yeah so right now i'm using asics[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay yeah i like to run too and i use nike [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i used to get tumor guy but i i really kinda moved over to nike [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] that's good you know it is running is a great exercise [Patient] it is[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri [Patient] yeah she was gon na put one in but she wanted me to see you first and urgently so they have n't called me yet for the mri[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal [Patient] okay go ahead sorry[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Referral][Doctor] that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me [Patient] yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment [Patient] okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri [Patient] okay alright thank you bye[SEP]","278":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] judy gomez , mrn 869723 . date of birth , 5 , 7 ,

[Patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ? [Patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's the 250\/50 dose , correct ? [Patient] yes , correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ? [Patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ? [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ? [Patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ? [Patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no kidding , that's great . [Patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] really ? [Patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ? [Patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ? [Patient] probably about three or four .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ? [Patient] yes , that's correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ? [Patient] i do .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then . [Patient] nope .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ? [Patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ? [Patient] correct .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ? [Patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ? [Patient] yeah , that's right .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ? [Patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ? [Patient] yeah , it does , it works great .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ? [Patient] yep , that's correct .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ? [Patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it . [Patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ? [Patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment . [Patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point .

[Patient] yes , ma'am .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] well , it looks like you have one stone in the left kidney but it's not obstructing anything . [Patient] i knew it had to be a kidney stone . i passed what looked like two small stones last week after i scheduled this appointment . and then for the past six weeks , i've had a few episodes of bright red urine the color of , like , cherry kool-aid . and last week , i was constantly having to pee and it hurt something terrible .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] how bad was your pain on a scale of zero to 10 ? zero being no pain and 10 being worse , as you can imagine . [Patient] um , at the time , i'd say an eight .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back ? [Patient] no , after passing those stones , things have felt a lot better .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Vegetative History][Doctor] that's good to hear . now , it looks like you're only taking alavert 10 milligrams a day and have no drug allergies . is that correct ? [Patient] that's right .[SEP][Discussion][Reassessment][Doctor] all right , let's take a look at you today . let's use my default pe . well , mrs. wood , we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones . fortunately , you passed two last week and the blood has nearly subsided . you do still have one stone in the left kidney . since it's not obstructing or causing pain , i do n't recommend any surgical intervention at this time . [Patient] i'd like to know what i can do to stop getting these stones .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] as we discussed last time , the formation of kidney stones can not be attributed to a particular cause . but several factors increase the risk , such as dehydration , family history , certain foods , digestive tract disease and certain medical conditions . [Patient] yeah , i know i do n't drink near the amount of water that i should . i drink more mountain dew than anything .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] you should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day . [Patient] so , if i weight 250 pounds , i should drink ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] that would be 125 ounces of water a day and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like mountain dew . [Patient] okay . is there any food i should n't eat ?[SEP]","284":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate . hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ? [Patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now . [Patient] yes . it's doing much better .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ? [Patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , that sounds good . [Patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ? [Patient] no , i'm not right now .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication . [Patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel . [Patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . [Patient] okay . i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? [Patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ? [Patient] twice a day .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ? [Patient] no , that's fine .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] how often are you using that one ? [Patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ? [Patient] i'm not .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ? [Patient] no wipes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ? [Patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ? [Patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk . [Patient] it is ? okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself . [Patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that . [Patient] yes , i did . thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it . [Patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] let's see . [Patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much . [Patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 . [Patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form . [Patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , mm-hmm . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else . [Patient] can you do the metro market ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find . [Patient] sure .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say . [Patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] correct , it's not a steroid . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad . [Patient] okay . got it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ? [Patient] okay , thank you for explaining .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so i will say , \" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . \" [Patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash. [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ? [Patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you . [Patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day . [Patient] that sounds good .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping . [Patient] okay , sounds good .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here . [Patient] thank you so much .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly . [Patient] sounds good .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream . [Patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ? [Patient] yeah , sounds good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] do you have enough refills ? [Patient] yeah , i think so .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one . [Patient] yes , i do .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well . [Patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?[SEP]","285":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] hey bruce so see here my my notes here is you here he had positive lab work for hep c so how're you doing today [Patient] i'm doing okay but i'm a little bit anxious about having hep c i've really surprised because i've been feeling fine they had done it as you know a screen as just part of my physical so i'm really surprised that that came back positive[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so in the past have any doctors ever told you that you had hep c [Patient] no never that's why i'm i'm so surprised[SEP][Other Socials][Drug History][Drug History][Doctor] okay so just you know i need to ask do you have a history of iv drug use or you know have known any hep c partners [Patient] i mean i used to party a lot and even did use iv drugs but i have been clean for over fifteen years now[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay that that's good i mean i'm i'm happy that you were able to to kick that habit i know a lot of my patients that i see you know they're still dealing with with those dements so i'm i'm i'm happy that you're able to do that so hopefully we can get you better okay [Patient] thank you[SEP][Drug History][Drug History][Doctor] so what about alcohol use is that something that you used to do a lot [Patient] i did i did i mean i i still have a beer here and there everyday but not as much as i used to[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay and have you ever smoked before [Patient] i do smoke i smoke about one to two cigarettes per day i've cut down a lot but i'm just having a hard time kicking those less too[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah yeah and that that's something i've got to work on too because hep c along with smoking you know both of those are n't are n't good so hopefully we can help you out you know if your pcp has n't prescribe something for you already and possibly we can we can do that for you as well [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so do you have any other medical conditions [Patient] no i'm actually other than that i just had my physical and i'm not taking any medications no i'm i'm pretty good otherwise[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay and what conditions would you say run in your family [Patient] i have high blood pressure diabetes and depression[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay alright so let me go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good and on general appearance you appear to be in no distress no jaundice on the skin on your heart exam you have a nice regular rhythm rate regular rate and rhythm with a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur is appreciated on your lung exam your lungs are clear without wheezes rales or rhonchi on your abdominal exam bowel sounds are present your abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly yes let me i will change that one splenomegaly and on your muscle exam there is no gait disturbance or edema so i did we i was able to review your your results of your recent lab work and your hcv antibody test was positive so your your liver panel we did one of those and it showed an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so that's pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you do have hepatitis c so your initial labs were consistent with that hep c diagnosis and so you know i do n't know if you read much about hep c but hepatitis c is a viral infection that does affect your liver and you've most likely had it for several years now it it it most patients do n't see symptoms until years later so the next step that i would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work so that includes checking your hep c rna and your hcv genotype and i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and we will do that by ordering an ultrasound elasto elastography with this information we will we we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment right so how does that sound [Patient] i hmmm so i do have a wife and kids so should i be worried about them[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] okay yeah so we can start with the same screening that you had for august first so we'll just let's do that hep c antibody test and i'll actually help you set up those appointments with your your family doctor and then we can just see you back in three weeks and based on the results you know we will take action as needed okay [Patient] okay that sounds good[SEP]","286":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hi richard how are you the medical assistant told me that you have a tick bite is that what happened [Patient] i really do n't

[Patient] yes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] okay . all right . okay , well , let's go ahead and , uh , i know the nurse did a review of systems , you know , with you , and i know that you're endorsing some back pain and a little bit of dizziness , um , and some blood in your urine . any other symptoms ? you know , muscle aches , chest pain ... uh , body aches , anything like that ?

[Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] um , and your abdomen also feels a little tender . you have some tenderness of the palpation of the right lower quadrant , but other than that , your heart sounds nice and clear and your lungs are clear as well . so let's go ahead and take a look at some of your results , okay ? [Patient] sure .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] hey , dragon ? show me the creatinine . so we ... we drew a creatinine when you came in here because i was concerned about the kidney stones . it ... it is uh ... it is up slightly , which might suggest that you have a little bit of a obstruction there of one- [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Lab Examination][Radiology Examination][Doctor] . of the stones . okay ? hey , dragon . show me the abdominal x-rays . okay , and there might be a question of a ... uh , of a stone there lower down , uh , but we'll wait for the official read there . so the , uh , abdominal x-rays show a possible kidney stone , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you . so , for your first problem , your back pain , i think you're having a recurrence of your kidney stones . so i wan na go ahead and order a ct scan without contrast of your abdomen and pelvis . okay ?

playing baseball when i was younger[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not [Patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go [Patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also [Patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that [Patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and does that seem to help or [Patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and [Patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then [Patient] yeah[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or [Patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Radiology Examination][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven . eight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan [Patient] no that sounds good[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay [Patient] sounds great[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay thanks [Patient] thanks[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or [Patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but[SEP]","290":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] so hi zachary good to see you today so i'm looking at my notes i see you coming in with some right elbow pain

[Patient] correct . i've had the pain on and off for about two years . i finally went to the er and a ... a few months ago and they did a ct scan .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] i saw that . [Patient] yeah . they said they did n't really see anything on the scan .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] yes , i agree . it looked normal . [Patient] the problem is i'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] is the pain there all the time ? [Patient] it's a nagging feeling and it just depends . sometimes it bothers me , sometimes it does n't .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] has this been the case over the past two years as well ? [Patient] more recently in the past couple months , at least with the constipation and diarrhea .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] and before that , how are your bowel movements ? [Patient] they were normal .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] uh , okay . so any blood in your stool ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] do you feel like you have more constipation or diarrhea ? [Patient] probably more constipation .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , so when you're constipated , do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard ? [Patient] i usually do n't go , but when i do , it's hard .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] and how often do you have a bowel movement when you are constipated ? [Patient] about three to four times a week . it's like when i need to go to the bathroom , if i can massage it , it feels like it's moving some and i can eventually go .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and when you have a bowel movement , does the pain change ? [Patient] yeah , it gets a little better .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] and are you eating and drinking okay ? any nausea or vomiting , heartburn or indigestion ? [Patient] none of that .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . so tell me about the diarrhea , how often do you get it ? [Patient] it kinda just depends on what i eat . i think i have a very sensitive stomach . if i eat pasta with a creamy sauce , i'm probably gon na have diarrhea .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and it does n't happen for multiple days in a row or is it just one time ? [Patient] it's usually just one time and then it's over .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] and how's your weight been ? any fluctuation ? [Patient] nice and pretty stable , although i could stand to lose about 25 pounds .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ? [Patient] not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even thought i've never been diagnosed with it .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi cancer or liver disease ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ? [Patient] i've never had any surgery .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all those are still intact ? [Patient] yup .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ? [Patient] no . i thought that happen when you turn 50 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well , that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy , like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants . [Patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain . [Patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ? [Patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ? [Patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ? [Patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ? [Patient] i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ? [Patient] hardly ever . maybe once a month .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] and do you consume alcohol ? [Patient] uh , yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay . and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice . [Patient] what would cause that ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted . [Patient] that's good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly . [Patient] what's that ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon . [Patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged . [Patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] correct . [Patient] so what does that mean ?[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged . [Patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ?[SEP][Medication][Acute Assessment][Doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that . [Patient] so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ?[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease . [Patient] so what do i need to do ?[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs . [Patient] okay . and then what ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too . [Patient] which medications ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ? [Patient] about 18 months .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives . [Patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol . [Patient] okay . i'll call him this afternoon .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that . [Patient] okay . when do you think i'll be able to get the ultrasound done ?[SEP]","306":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] miss edwards is here for evaluation of facial pain

couple of months now and i went to my family doctor and they said i should come see you[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay great i would like to ask you a little bit more about that had in your face do

a pain in my right cheek bone right face area[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face [Patient] not that i've noticed no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face including the other side of your face [Patient] no it's just on the right side mostly not on the left side just on the right side of my face[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile or while you're doing other things any weakness there [Patient] not really i mean i've i've i've tried to you know when i smile my smile seems equal on both sides my eyes i do n't have any weakness there my vision seems to be unchanged but just this stabbing severe pain it's just like excruciating pain that i get sometimes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] does it happen on its own or there are certain things that trigger it [Patient] sometimes if i'm if certain temperatures seem to trigger it sometimes or if it's super where it's cold i get a trigger sometimes sometimes certain kind of sensory outside of the wind sometimes that seems to trigger it but that's about it[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and anything that you've done to to that helps for a little bit when you pain excess [Patient] you know i've tried ibuprofen and motrin that had really has n't helped it just comes on suddenly and then it's kinda stabbing excruciating pain i've tried rubbing some you know some tiger balm on it that did n't work but that's you know so i i went to my family doctor and he said you know i really need to see a neurosurgeon[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] got it how long do these episodes last these pain [Patient] you know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour but generally generally a few minutes[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know [Patient] no nothing like that[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches [Patient] i mean i get occasional headaches but not really i do n't have a history of migraines but i occasionally get headaches like everybody else i take some tylenol that usually goes away but this is different[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten [Patient] when it comes on it's like a ten it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick and but usually you know after a few minutes usually it goes away but sometimes it can last up to an hour[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] great . so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you [Patient] sure[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth . that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that [Patient] yep[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] you can hear it on the other side as well [Patient] yep[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay [Patient] yeah it's a little bit numb on my right side not so much on my left side[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal [Patient] it feels a little bit dull on my left on my right side my left side it feels sharp[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri [Patient] okay[SEP][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face [Patient] how do we treat it[SEP][Medication][Doctor] well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first . for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve [Patient] okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this [Patient] sure[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Medication][Doctor] it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you [Patient] okay sounds good let's do it[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain [Patient] yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not[SEP][Follow-up][Doctor] i think one month would be a great time to follow up [Patient] okay sounds good so if you want to send that prescription over to my pharmacy that would be fine and then why do n't i come back in about a month and we'll go from there[SEP]","307":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , albert . how are you ?

[Patient] so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ? [Patient] um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ? [Patient] yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , i see that . [Patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] what do you do for a living ?

[Patient] no , that's new .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . how is it working for you ? [Patient] my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , \" i can not do this . \" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm . okay . [Patient] and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too . [Patient] i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also . [Patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] hmm , okay . [Patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right . [Patient] yeah , i do n't know .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too . [Patient] i figured maybe that's what it was .[SEP][Personal History][Other Socials][Doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also . [Patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that . [Patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] have you lost weight ? [Patient] no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , \" what is going on ? \"[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] all right . [Patient] and now i am feeling better .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner . [Patient] well , the past six months i have lost some weight .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , good . um , anything else going on ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative\/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ? [Patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then . [Patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check . [Patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] have you had the vaccine ? [Patient] yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do . [Patient] yeah , i agree .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] all right . well , let's complete your exam . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps . [Patient] yeah , but they're not as big as they were .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ? [Patient] it does , where your left hand just was .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , right here ? [Patient] yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Physical Examination][Therapeutic History][Doctor] all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ? [Patient] yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , great . all right , looks good . [Patient] good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] you can go ahead and sit up . [Patient] thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now . [Patient] okay . and what could that mean ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign . [Patient] and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so those are all good things . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change . [Patient] we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them . [Patient] yeah , i agree there .[SEP]","312":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] hey linda good to see you today so looking here in my notes looks like you you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on [Patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go [Patient] it's constant[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright are you able to urinate [Patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes [Patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] third time alright [Patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time[SEP]","313":"[Conversation Start][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09\/18\/1949 . patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction . bmp's been , uh , 3,000 in march , and is about six- was up to 6,000 in april . she was increasingly dyspneic . we changed her furosemide and torsemide 20 milligrams by mouth daily . uh to note , the patient is not currently on potassium supplement . her lisinopril had- has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in march . also did when i saw her last april . she reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at east metro . it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery . hey , miss miller , how are you today ?

injured your wrist could you tell me a bit about what happened [Patient] yeah i was walking up and down the stairs i was doing my laundry and i slipped and i tried to catch myself and i put my arms out to catch myself and then all of a sudden i just my wrist started to hurt real bad and it got real swollen[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] wow okay so which wrist are we talking about left or right [Patient] it's my right one of course[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and then have you ever injured this arm before [Patient] no i have not[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright so on a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain [Patient] gosh it's like a nine[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] wow okay have you done anything to ease it [Patient] yeah i did the ice thing i put ice on it and then i you know i even i have a ace wrap at home i try to do that[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen [Patient] this happened yesterday morning[SEP]","334":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on [Patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta [Patient] yes and and fish oil[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that [Patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy[SEP][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so [Patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging [Patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then[SEP][Referral][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time [Patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack[SEP][Referral][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies [Patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking [Patient] i thought it was close to sixty[SEP][Other Treatments][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet [Patient] yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results[SEP]","335":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] okay  good morning [Patient] good morning thanks doctor doctor cooper i'm i'm you know i'm a little i'm sad to be in here but you know thanks for taking me in i appreciate it[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] sure absolutely what can i help you with today [Patient] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now [Patient] i have an albuterol inhaler[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night [Patient] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens [Patient] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then when you use your inhaler [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] does it does it alleviate the problem [Patient] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler [Patient] okay[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] for the symptoms [Patient] yes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so [Patient] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that [Patient] no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening [Patient] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Drug History][Doctor] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems [Patient] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having [Patient] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do[SEP]","336":"[Conversation Start][Chitchat][Doctor] i know the nurse told you about dax .

[Patient] yes . it's doing much better .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?

[Patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . [Patient] okay . i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? [Patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ? [Patient] twice a day .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?

[Patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ? [Patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk . [Patient] it is ? okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself . [Patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that . [Patient] yes , i did . thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it . [Patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .

[Patient] yes , that's correct . it was icy , and i have to walk up a flight of stairs to my house . i stepped and my feet just went out . fell on my left side . seems like my shoulder and wrist took the brunt . it's been hurting since .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah , that does seem like a likely cause of your symptoms . anything seem to make the pain worse ? [Patient] well , i've always hit the gym and lifted weights . i've been trying to keep with my routine of two days a week , but it's been hard . the pain is worse when i lift , and i have n't been able to lift more than 15 or 20 pounds which is very frustrating .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm . i can imagine it is when you're so accustomed to your routine . [Patient] exactly . i really enjoy my exercise , but over the past one to two weeks , i've stopped hitting the gym because the pain just was n't worth it honestly . i do keep up with my walking , though . my wife and i walk about 30 minutes almost every day . we have done this since i retired from my office job last year .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i do not blame you , mr . james . does anything seem to help the pain that you've tried ?

[Patient] so what are the possible treatments ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Referral][Doctor] well , we have a few options you can try . first option would be to start with physical therapy . i would recommend two sessions per week as well as any other exercises they give you to do at home . we can start there and if that does n't improve your pain , then we could try a cortisone injection . [Patient] i like the idea of starting with the physical therapy and have a next step if it does n't help . i am not opposed to a shot but would like to try the therapy first .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] all right . great . i'll get a referral order , and they will call you within the next day or two to get you scheduled . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] mm-hmm . also , please continue to ice , especially your shoulder , and rest as much as you can .

[Patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ? [Patient] correct .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ? [Patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ? [Patient] yeah , that's right .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ? [Patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ? [Patient] yeah , it does , it works great .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ? [Patient] yep , that's correct .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ? [Patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it . [Patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP]","358":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] okay hi andrea well i [Patient] hello[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] i understand you're you've come in with some right knee pain can you tell me about it what's going on [Patient] it it's not the right knee it's the left knee[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay the left knee [Patient] and it just happens occasionally less than once a day when i'm walking all of a sudden it is kind of like gives out and i think here i'm going to fall but i usually catch myself so lot of times i have to hold a grocery cart and that helps a lot so it comes and goes and it it passes just about as quickly as it comes i do n't know what it is whether i stepped wrong or i just do n't know[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay well so where does it hurt like in on the inside or the outside or [Patient] internally and it it just the whole kneecap fades[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay well did you hear or feel a pop at any point [Patient] no[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you ever had any type of injury to that knee i mean did you fall or bump it against something or [Patient] no not that i can recall[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and have is it painful have you taken anything for for pain [Patient] no because it does n't last that long[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] so is it interfering with your just things you like to do and [Patient] hmmm no not really[SEP]","359":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] and good morning hi beverly [Patient] good morning[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] how do you see your last name [Patient] howard[SEP]","360":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03\/04\/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ? [Patient] good morning .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller . [Patient] it's nice to meet you as well .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ? [Patient] that's correct .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ? [Patient] well , right now the hand is .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , that's good . [Patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , i see . [Patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm , okay . [Patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though . [Patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ? [Patient] uh , no .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ? [Patient] um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ? [Patient] well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ? [Patient] uh , yes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . like , in terms of gripping things ? [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] really ? [Patient] yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ? [Patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ? [Patient] uh , yep .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ? [Patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ? [Patient] yeah , just a little strain .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ? [Patient] uh , yes .[SEP][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off . [Patient] i see .[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ? [Patient] i think that sounds good to me .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list . [Patient] uh , no , i do n't .[SEP][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ? [Patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ? [Patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again . [Patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ? [Patient] well , my hand is still bothering me .[SEP]","361":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hello .

[Patient Guest] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , wow. . [Patient Guest] yeah , it has definitely been a whirlwind of stuff . when we saw the geneticist , she told us that sometimes people with this syndrome , they have trouble with their kidneys . that they might actually fuse into one . she also said sometimes they have problems with their legs , so that was why we saw ortho .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . okay . [Patient Guest] so we have seen everybody , really . we are just here to make sure that her kidneys are looking good right now .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , okay . so , um , tell me about how many wet diapers she has in a 24 hour period ?

okay and have you been able to walk on it at all [Patient] no i was so initially when i first fell i was unable to walk at on it at all i had a friend that was visiting and so she heard me fall so she helped me inside now today i have been able to put a little bit more weight on it but i'm still limping[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and then what have you been doing for your foot or ankle pain since that happened [Patient] so i like iced it last night and kept it elevated and i also took some ibuprofen last night and this morning before coming in today[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and can you rate your pain for me [Patient] i would say right now it's like a four out of ten[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and does the ibuprofen help with that pain [Patient] it does it does help with the pain[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and when you take your ibuprofen what can you what's your pain level then [Patient]

ibuprofen okay what's your pain level without then [Patient] i would say probably a six[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright that that sounds good have you ever injured that foot and ankle before [Patient] you know i've had a lot of injuries to my ankle but i've never hurt this ankle before i just realized an error[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay you know and i see here that you have a history of playing sports looks like you played soccer in college and then played a little bit of a inner marrow soccer now [Patient] yeah[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] i'm i'm guessing you probably have n't been able to do that since you hurt your ankle [Patient] no i have not been[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] so did you hear about the new major league soccer stadium and team that's coming to town they opened in the this year actually they built the stadium have you been down there yet [Patient] no i have to get there[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah we are all excited it's going to be a good time well have you experienced any numbness or tingling in that right foot [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam your vitals look good and everything there looks okay now i'm gon na do a focused exam on your right ankle i do appreciate some ecchymosis or bruising over the lateral malleolus malleolus associated with some edema or swelling of that area you are positive for tenderness to palpation of the anterior lateral soft tissue and now i do n't appreciate any laxity on anterior drawer and inversion stress there is no bony tenderness on palpation to that foot or ankle area now on neurovascular exam of your right foot you have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch and all of that is consistent with what's present on your left side as well so i did review the results of your of your x-ray the x-ray of your right ankle showed no fracture which is a good thing so now let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for the first problem of right ankle pain your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain or i'm sorry right ankle sprain of your lateral ligament complex more specifically your anterior talofibular ligament now this ligament's on the outside of your ankle ankle which got stretched when you fell the best treatment at this time for your sprain is to keep your leg elevated when you're seated and let's continue to ice okay you're gon na be given an air cast which is gon na help stabilize that ankle and i'm also going to prescribe some crutches because i want you to stay off that leg and start walking on it stay off your leg for now and then in a couple of days start walking on it as tolerated do you have any questions or concerns for me [Patient] so how long do you think it'll take to heal[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] so your symptoms should significantly improve over a few weeks but i'd like to follow up with you and see how you're doing let's say i'll see you again in fourteen days now i do want you to go ahead and continue to take nsaids or ibuprofen as needed to help with any pain and that's also gon na help reduce that inflammation and swelling okay [Patient] okay[SEP]","368":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey charles i'm using this cool new recording device to help me with my documentation is that okay with you [Patient] sure[SEP][Acute

[Patient] all right , how have you been ?[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm good . [Patient] good , good .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle ? you look trim . [Patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt . makes you look thin . [Patient] yeah , i guess that's it .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ? [Patient] good , the testosterone's going well .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] that's great . [Patient] uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , well that's good . [Patient] so the finasteride i'm only taking half a pill , it's the 5 milligram one .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that . [Patient] and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] in and out . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there . [Patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ? [Patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] right . [Patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] wow , that's remarkable . [Patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .[SEP][Discussion][Lab Examination][Doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it . [Patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference . [Patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] absolutely . [Patient] my red blood cell count has increased .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though . [Patient] stable .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think . [Patient] yeah . , is it ?[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good . [Patient] nice , that's good news .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so . [Patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me . [Patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] well , your levels are high . [Patient] are they right now ?[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] well , i mean they were last time . [Patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ? [Patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] all right . [Patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Reassessment][Doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well . [Patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 . [Patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still . [Patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] true . but right now i would not change your dose . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] make sense ? [Patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Other Socials][Doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ? [Patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] for all of them ?

i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [Patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [Patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [Patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [Patient] yes yes that's the name of it[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [Patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [Patient] it does[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or

part[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [Patient] yeah for only once i can think of

er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [Patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [Patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [Patient] yeah[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [Patient] probably about a month ago[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of

your hands [Patient] no no numbness or tingling[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright so let's just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here i did review your vitals everything here looks good now lem me take a look at your shoulder alright now on your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion and how does that feel here [Patient] that hurts[SEP][Physical Examination][Radiology Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay sorry there is tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus but there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints you have good hand grips alright and then now on your neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is intact to light touch alright so what does that all mean well firstly lem me go ahead and take a look at your results of your shoulder x-ray here now i reviewed the results and there are no fractures so that's good so let's go ahead and talk about my assessment and plan here wayne so for your problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured the tendons of the muscles that help make up your shoulder muscles so i will be ordering an mri for your left shoulder to be sure that there is nothing else going on with your shoulder okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Referral][Doctor] now i'm also going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and during that time you may also continue to take tylenol now if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection for your shoulder which can provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan at all [Patient] so do you think this pain will ever go away[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] now well many patients are very successful with the physical therapy those will those help strengthen you know they do a lot of strengthening exercises with you to help strengthen you know your muscles so that it's not your movements not always relying on those joints predominantly so we're gon na go ahead and start with that and then see how you do okay [Patient] okay okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] alright okay well do you have any other questions for me [Patient] no i think that's it[SEP][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] okay well i'm gon na have the nurse check you out and she's also gon na give you some educational materials on the physical therapy and what to expect and and then

hurt [Patient] that hurts more yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay if i push in on your big toe and move it back and forth does that hurt [Patient] yes it does and it it's almost like those joints that when you push it back it's almost like it's grinding a little bit too[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay if i push in between your big toe and your second toe here does that hurt [Patient] a little bit but not terrible[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay what about if i push on the other side here [Patient] yeah yeah right there on the outside of it absolutely[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Radiology Examination][Doctor] okay and i'm feeling a little bit of bone spur here as well let me let me get an x-ray [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] and after we take a peek at that we'll develop a plan [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] so at this point what would i do if i'm going out of the room and then coming back [Patient] you could hit pause or hit the stop button and just restart it the next time you come in[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] okay alrighty so taking a look at your x-ray and you do have you you have a large spur there on the top of your big toe joint [Patient] oh[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] and you've lost a lot of the cartilage [Patient] oh[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] and so you you've got some arthritis in there we we call this hallux rigidus and treatment for this to start off with we we put an insert in your shoe called an orthotic and we give you a little bit of anti-inflammatory medication or like a drug called meloxicam you only have to take it once a day [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it's usually pretty well tolerated have you ever had any trouble with your stomach [Patient] no never never had any problems with my stomach i love the i love the mexican's food the hotter the better so i hope i never get a problem with my stomach[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i hope you do n't either one of the things that we get concerned about with an anti-inflammatory like that is that it can irritate the stomach so if you do start to notice that you're getting heartburn or pain right there [Patient] yeah[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] below your your sternum you would need to stop taking the medicine and give me a call [Patient] okay[SEP]","387":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] hey philip good to see you today so take a look here at my notes i see you're coming in for some right knee pain and you have a past medical history of

down and i just still having some knee issues[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay well that that's not good do you [Patient] no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] what part of your knee would you say hurts [Patient] i would just say you know the it it you know it basically when i when i'm flexing my knee when i'm moving it up and down and i put pressure on it[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright did you hear a pop or anything like that [Patient] i did feel something pop yes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and did it was it swollen afterwards or is it looks a little bit swollen right now [Patient] yeah little bit swollen yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so so far have you taken anything for the pain [Patient] just taking some ibuprofen just for some swelling[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay that's it what would you say your pain score is a out of ten with ten being the worst pain you ever felt [Patient] i would say that when i'm stationary i do n't really feel a lot of pain but if i start doing some mobility i would say probably a four five[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] about a four okay and how long ago did you say this was is this happened this injury [Patient] it's been a week now[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] a week okay alright alright so we will take a look i'll do a physical exam of your knee in a second but i do want to check up you do have a past medical history of hypertension i'm seeing here you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was one fifty over seventy so have you been taking your medications regularly [Patient] yes i have[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so you might have a little white coat syndrome i know some of my patients definitely do have that so what about your diet i know we talked a little bit before about you reducing your sodium intake to about twenty three hundred milligrams per per day i know you were during the pandemic your diet got out of little bit out of control so how have you been doing how have you been doing with that [Patient] i definitely need some help there i have not have not made some some changes[SEP][Physical Examination][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay yeah we definitely need to get you to lower that salt intake get your diet a little bit better because the hope is to get you off that medication and get your blood pressure to a manageable level okay so we yeah we definitely can talk about that alright so lem me take a look at your knee i'll do a quick physical exam on you and before i do just want to make sure you're not having any chest pain today [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] are you any belly pain [Patient] no[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] no shortness of breath just wan na make sure [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so i'm just gon na listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any wheezes or crackles listen to your heart so on your heart exam i do still hear that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and you already had that and so we we knew about that already so lem me look at your knee here so when i press here on the inside of your knee does that hurt [Patient] a little bit[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] little bit how about when i press on the outs the outside gon na press on the outside is that painful [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] no alright so i'm gon na have you flex your knee is that painful [Patient] yeah that's uncomfortable[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] that's uncomfortable and extend it so that's painful [Patient] yeah yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Medication][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Reassessment][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay so on your knee exam i i see that you do have pain to palpation of the medial aspect of your right knee you have some pain with flexion extension i also identify some edema around the knee and some effusion you have a little bit of fluid in there as well so prior to coming in we did do an x-ray of that right knee and luckily you did n't break anything so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have what we call a mcl strain so a medial collateral ligament strain so when you fell i think you twisted a little bit and so it irritated you strained that that ligament there so for that what we can do for you first i'm gon na prescribe you some ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams and you can take that twice a day and that's gon na help you with that swelling and that pain that you currently do have i'm also gon na put you in a a knee brace just to try and support those muscles to allow it to heal and then i want you to ice the knee you can do that for twenty minutes at a time for three to four times a day that should also help with the the swelling of your knee for your hypertension now i'm gon na keep you on that twenty of lisinopril okay because you are taking it and you you're doing pretty good with it i also want to get you a referral to nutrition just to try to help you with that diet you know because right now you are your diet is little bit out of control so we just need to rain you in a little bit and hopefully you know with their help we can eventually get you off that lisinopril alright so do you have any questions for me [Patient] do i need to elevate my leg or stay off my leg or[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah i would yeah you can elevate your leg stay off your stay off your leg you know if you have any kids have them work out in the yard instead of you just to to for a couple of weeks it's a good thing if you want to

a kidney stone you had some in the past so we're gon na take a look at that and then you also have a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes we want to take a look at those as well so first thing what's going on with your kidneys you as what how long ago have you been feeling pain and and how's all that [Patient] pain's been up and down i went to the emergency room last week but now i think i'm doing a little bit better[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so the case of kidney stones so have you had you said you've had them in the past and how often would you say [Patient] i do n't know i this is probably like my seventh or eighth kidney stone[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] seven or eight kidney stones so do you think you passed it yet or is it still in the [Patient] i think

History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay that that's that's that's really good did they do anything for you at the hospital giving you any medications [Patient] they gave me some pain medicine[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay do you remember what it was [Patient] i think it was percocet[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay well that's good i'm very glad to see that you were able to pass that stone have you seen a urologist before about this [Patient] i have n't seen one in a while but yes i saw someone maybe a year ago[SEP][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay so yeah i know you keep having these recurrent kidney stones so i definitely think we can get you a referral to urology just to check up on that and also wan na do some labs as well [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so i also see you're here for you have a past medical history of of hypertension and when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was a one fifty over ninety i'm reading here in your chart you're on two point five of norvasc [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] now have you been taking that regularly [Patient] i have but at home my blood pressure is always great[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay maybe you have a little white coat syndrome some of my patients do have it i have it myself and i'm a provider so i definitely understand yeah i know we we talked about last time you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking those about two to three times a week so what have those readings been i'm usually like one thirty to one forty over sixty to seventy [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] that's that's that's not too bad i think when you first came in you were around like one eighty so it seems to be that that norvasc is is working for you how about your diet i know you were having a little issue eating some fast food and and cakes and cookies and have you been able to get that under control [Patient] yeah it's hard to give up the fast food altogether because it's a lot of on the go you know[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay so do you think you would be able to get that under control by yourself or would you do you think you would need help with that maybe a dietitian be able to help you out [Patient] yeah i do n't know i do n't know if i can make another appointment i just add to the extra[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah yeah definitely understand [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Other Treatments][Doctor] alright yeah so i mean that's one thing we just got ta work one is your diet we try to keep you at least just twenty three hundred milligrams or less of sodium per day i know that's hard for a lot of salads and stuff i know it's hard for lot of people especially with all like the the prepackage foods we have around today so that's definitely something we we should work on [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so let's also look here you have a history of diabetes and so you're on that five hundred milligrams of metformin daily now have you been taking that as well [Patient] yeah i take my metformin[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so what have your blood sugars been running daily [Patient] well i do n't check it very often[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so i'm looking here i think last after your last visit you got a1c now was six . seven so it's a little bit high it's gone down a little bit since you were first diagnosed with the type two diabetes a year ago so i'm glad we're making progress with that as well alright so i'm just gon na do a quick physical exam on you before i do just wan na make sure are you having any chest pain today [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright any any belly pain [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so i'm gon na listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles listen to your heart so on your heart exam i do hear that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and we already knew about that previously so it has n't gotten any worse so that's good so i'm gon na just press here in your abdomen because that you did have those kidney stones does that hurt [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright i'm gon na press here on your back [Patient] no pain[SEP][Physical Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay so on your abdomen exam of your abdomen i'm showing no tenderness to palpation of the abdomen or tenderness of the the cva either on the right side so that that's good i think that's pretty much cleared up so let's we'll talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you and so my assessment you you did have the those kidney stones but i i think they are passed this time but i do want to get a couple of labs so we'll get a urinalysis [Patient] okay[SEP][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] alright we'll get a urine culture just to make sure everything is is cleared up i also want to give you a referral to referral referral to urology [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Doctor] because you do keep having these all the time and so maybe there's something else going wrong and so they can help get that under control [Patient] can i see doctor harris[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Doctor] of course yeah we can we can get you that road to doctor harris and [Patient] he's not like[SEP][Medication][Other Treatments][Reassessment][Doctor] he's great he's he's he he he's great i've heard he does really good work so that'll be good so for the hypertension you seem to be doing well on the two . five of norvasc so we are not gon na make any changes to that do you need any refills right now [Patient] no usually the pharmacy just sends them through when i call[SEP][Referral][Doctor] okay great so we we wo n't we gave you refills with that i do wan na give you a consult to nutrition [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Other Treatments][Doctor] just to help you with that diet [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] because i think that's a major factor of us eventually getting you off of all medications [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Discussion][Reassessment][Doctor] and then for your diabetes i'm just keep you on that on that five hundred of metformin okay i think you're doing well with that as well also but i do want you to start taking your blood sugars if you can take them before every meal [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] just to gauge where you are so you can tell how much food you should actually be be eating [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] alright [Patient] i can try that[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so how does that that sound [Patient] that sounds like a plan when should i come back and see you[SEP][Follow-up][Personal History][Doctor] so you can you can come back in three months and we'll check up again i forgot you did tell me last time that you were having some issues with insomnia [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] how is that going for you is it still happening [Patient] i mean

[Patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [Patient] yes , i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [Patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Other Socials][Doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [Patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 . [Patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yep , right here . [Patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [Patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .[SEP][Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [Patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [Patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , good . [Patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ? [Patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ... [Patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [Patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you . [Patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated . [Patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [Patient] okay , thank you . got it .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ? [Patient] no , not that i know of .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . [Patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ? [Patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay . we might give you some of that . [Patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ? [Patient] yes , i also do have that problem .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that . [Patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , sounds good . [Patient] great .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [Patient] okay , i will do that .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future . [Patient] okay , that's okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not . [Patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range . [Patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [Patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .[SEP][Personal History][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [Patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , this is much better . [Patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [Patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [Patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [Patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started . [Patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] does that make sense ? [Patient] yes , it does .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study . [Patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you . [Patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify . [Patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up . [Patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you . [Patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be . [Patient] okay , will do .[SEP]","397":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] patient is julia jones , date of birth 5\/16\/1996 . she is a new breast reduction consult . hello , how are you doing today ? i'm dr. gonzalez . it's nice to meet you . [Patient] nice to meet you , ma'am . how are you ?[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] i'm doing good , thank you . so you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ? [Patient] yes . that's right .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . perfect . let me just get logged in , here . have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ? [Patient] no , i have n't .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and how long have you been considering this ? [Patient] it's probably been about six or seven years . but i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure . [Patient] okay , that's reassuring .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah . so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having . and then i'll do a quick exam . [Patient] okay . that sounds good .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails . and , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ? [Patient] i have blue cross blue shield . well , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .[SEP][Discussion][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company . and what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not . but we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you'll be on the new plan ? [Patient] most likely july .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ? [Patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . i do have a lotta pain here and here . but i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not . it gets painful and builds up . so i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and in your neck and your upper back . and how long has this been going on ? would you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ? [Patient] i would say since i was in high school .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup . [Patient] yes . i do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often . i mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable . and the others are expensive in my size .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ? [Patient] no , i do not have any kids now . but we might plan to in the future .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ? [Patient] sometimes , yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating . [Patient] no , but they are always sweaty .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ? [Patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ? [Patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ? [Patient] mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ? [Patient] yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] congratulations . that's great . and then , um- [Patient] thank you .[SEP][Other Socials][Drug History][Doctor] . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ? [Patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast . [Patient] okay . that's fine .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .

'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too . [Patient] i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also .

[Patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?

neurologic findings there is no pronator drift sensation is intact reflexes are two plus and symmetric at the biceps triceps knees and ankles so this means everything looks good karen [Patient] that's great[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Doctor] good alright so i'm gon na go ahead and tell you what we're gon na do so i'm gon na tell you my assessment and plan here so dad so for the first problem i do believe that karen does have a tick eye tics are very common in children and as many as you know one in five children have a tick during their school years and tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging facial grimacing sniffling excessive throat clearing and uncontrolled vocalization i can say that essentially they're brief sudden and involuntary motor movements now we do n't have a full understanding of the cause of the tics but they typically occur around five to ten years of age but most ticks go away on their own and they disappear within a year so these are what we call transient tics and the best thing to do is ignore the tics so it does n't seem to be bothering karen and she seems to be doing well in school and activities so it may wax and wane over time but you might notice it more towards the end of the day when the child is tired so you may also you know see it if they're stressed so that's why it's important to just ignore it now when you draw attention to the tick it does make the child conscious so that can make the tic worse so we want to be careful again just to to kind of not to draw too much attention on it and do you have any questions for me [Patient] so you mean you're telling me you do n't think he had a seizure or a bit or nothing[SEP]","413":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , john . how are you ?

[Patient] no , that's new .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . how is it working for you ? [Patient] my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , \" i can not do this . \" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm . okay . [Patient] and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too . [Patient] i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also . [Patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] hmm , okay . [Patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right . [Patient] yeah , i do n't know .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too . [Patient] i figured maybe that's what it was .[SEP][Personal History][Other Socials][Doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also . [Patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that . [Patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] have you lost weight ?

[Patient] no .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative\/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ? [Patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then . [Patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check . [Patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] have you had the vaccine ? [Patient] yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .

it does it alleviate the problem [Patient] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler [Patient] okay[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] for the symptoms [Patient] yes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so [Patient] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that [Patient] no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening [Patient] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Drug History][Doctor] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems [Patient] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having [Patient] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation [Patient] so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like

[Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so looking at your vitals your blood pressure seems alright we are in like the one thirty over seventy range that's perfectly fine your respiratory rate i have you at an eighteen again pretty normal when i listen here to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops that means your heart sounds great on your respiratory exam your lungs sound clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal back exam as i'm looking here i do n't notice any overlying redness or bruising on the skin when i push here on the midline of your back does it hurt [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so there is midline tenderness at the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness alright so are you able to bend forward [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright and are you able to bend backward [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright do either of those actions cause you pain [Patient] bending forward[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and so i'm gon na have you lie down

down your left leg correct [Patient] yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright when i touch are there any like decreased sensation [Patient] no[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Radiology Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay alright so patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical alright so i received before you came in here we got an mri and so in reviewing your results it does show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right neuroforaminal i do n't like this word neural foraminal stenosis what those complicated words is that i just said is that it seems that you have a a a herniated disk with nerve impingement so let's talk about my assessment and plan alright your symptoms are in line with a i'm sorry you have lumbar back pain at the l4 l5 disk space due to a herniated disk with radiculopathy this means that one of your disks that sits between your vertebrae like the bones in your spine is bulging out and the bulge is pinching on some nerves so that's why you are feeling that pain like radiating down your leg i'm gon na recommend something a spinal injection with a strong nsaid and called the i'm sorry and a corticosteroid i'm just gon na inject it into the lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of like an x-ray to localize the exact area of your pain this should help with the inflammation that's causing your pain i know that sounds a bit scary it this is a typical procedure that i do all the time it's in office and we can get you scheduled today if you would like so what questions do you have right now [Patient] is that something that we can do today[SEP]","425":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey , ms. hill . nice to see you .

[Patient] yes , i think so , a little bit .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] good . what's your skin care routine like now ? [Patient] do you wan na know , like , the things i currently use ?[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] yes . what do you do for your acne in the morning ? and then what do you do at nighttime ? [Patient] i wash my face , more like i wipe it down in the morning . then at night i use an elf facial cleanser called the super clarity cleanser . i finish with a toner and then the persa-gel .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] when you say , \" wipe your face in the morning , \" do you use a product or just water ? [Patient] mm , just water and a washcloth , really . if i feel really greasy , sometimes i'll use the elf cleanser in the morning , too .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and is today a good day , bad day , or an average day for you ? [Patient] mm , i would say it's probably a good day for me , of course , since i'm here , right ?[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] acne is always good when you come to see the doctor . do you find that your acne flares with your periods ?

[Patient Guest] no . kayla really has been doing a good job with the facial care regimen . it just does n't seem to help as much as we wanted .[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] got it . okay . well , let's take a look then . full exam is performed today , except for under the underwear and under the bra . multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities . scattered skin colored papules . open and closed comedones . and erythmateous papules on the face , primarily on the forehead and with also some on the central cheeks and chin . the chest and back are relatively spared . and the remainder of the examination is normal . so , what i'm seeing from your exam today is mild to moderate acne , mostly comodonal with small inflammatory component . [Patient] okay , so is there anything we can do to help it ?[SEP][Medication][Doctor] yes . i would like to start with a topical therapy first . every morning , you will wash your face with a mild cleanser then use a moisturizer labeled , \" noncomedogenic , \" with sunscreen spf 30 or higher . this means it wo n't clog your pores . now , in the evening , wash your face with the same cleanser and allow it to dry . apply adapalene , 0.1 % cream , in a thin layer to the areas you generally get acne . i want you to start off using this a few nights a week and slowly work up to using it every night . if it is ... excuse me , if it is very expensive or not covered by insurance , you can try different gel over the counter . you can follow that with clean and clear persa-gel in a thin layer , or where you generally get acne . and then a noncomedogenic moisturizer . you're atopic retinoid will cause some sensitivity , so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside . it may also cause some dryness or irritation . [Patient] okay , i can do that .[SEP][Physical Examination][Follow-up][Doctor] you also have multiple benign moles on your arms , legs , back and abdomen . this means they all look normal with no worrisome features . we will see if you have any progress over the next six months and follow up at that time . [Patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you .[SEP]","432":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] good morning julie how are you doing this morning [Patient] i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you because of this this knee pain that i've been having for about six months now[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and do you remember what caused the pain initially [Patient] honestly i do n't i ca n't think of anytime if i fell or like i i've really been trying to think and i ca n't really think of any specific event[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay now it it says here that it's in both knees is that correct [Patient] yes both my knees[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay it kinda try let's let's try describing the pain for me please [Patient] yeah it's kind of feels like it's like right behind my kneecaps[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] a deep achy pain okay what kind of activities makes the pain feel worse [Patient] let's see so anytime so if i'm sitting at my desk and i get up i have a lot of pain so anytime from like standing up from sitting for a while or even going up and down the stairs[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay so you work from home [Patient] i do[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay okay so there is a lot of desk setting at home is your office upstairs or is it i mean do you have to go up or downstairs to get to it [Patient] no well first thing in the morning but otherwise it's downstairs[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay okay how do you like working from home [Patient] you know it has it's plus and minuses[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] and the parking i'm sure the parking is [Patient] and the parking is great[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah i you know if i could do telehealth visits all day long i would be totally happy with that yeah and just set it home and do those so you mentioned is there anything that makes that pain feel better [Patient] usually after like if i feel that pain and then i just it does get better[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past what have what are they and did they work at all [Patient] yeah i've done some ibuprofen or aleve sometimes some tylenol and that does help[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay but you're never really pain free is that what i hear you saying [Patient] not really unless i'm like really just resting which i hate to do but otherwise any type of movement especially from sitting it causes pain[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so are you active other than going up and down the steps to your office [Patient] very i'm a big runner i love to run i run about five to six miles a day but with this knee with with these knee pain that i've been having it's i barely can even do half a mile[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah you know what that's that's i am a biker and i know that once you get that into your you know you have loved doing that activity it's so frustrating when you ca n't it's almost like a it's almost like a dry it almost becomes a drug when you get up [Patient] exactly[SEP]","433":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , ms. brooks . i'm dr. baker . how are you ?

[Patient] hi , dr. martinez . this weekend was a bit rough . i've had this numbness and tingling for a few weeks now .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so it's in both of your hands ? [Patient] yes , ever since my car wreck last december when i broke them ... well , once they healed , i mean , i noticed it more , the tingling and the numbness .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] and you still wear the splint only on the right wrist ? [Patient] no , i also wear the left sometimes . the right is just worse , but the splint helps . both have really gotten worse over the last month . when i broke them , my right wrist was definitely in worse shape . i've also been having some s- mild stiffness in my neck too . i hit my head during the accident , and they told me it was a contusion .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and where would you say the tingling and numbness is ? [Patient] on this side , it goes from here and here up to about here . on the other side , it's from here to here .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] i see . so on the right side , you're pointing from the middle and ring finger , all the way up the forearm . and on the left , the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger . and is there any pain or just tingling and numbness ? [Patient] eh , it's mainly just sore . sometimes they throb , but overall , they feel weaker too , especially when i'm using them . the tingling happens more when they hurt , but when it goes away , the tingling is dull .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and when do you feel these symptoms ? [Patient] well , really , i guess , just more so at night , and they come and go throughout the day .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ? [Patient] like , feeling something ? no , not that i can really think of . though , in general , they may be less sensitive than they should be , but i can still feel . they also gave me some nerve pain medicine , but i have n't been taking it like i should .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and are you still on the coreg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety ? [Patient] yes , i'm still taking those . i had prediabetes too , but i got it under control by changing my diet .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and no history of thyroid issues , correct ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] all right , thank you , mr. cook . okay , first , we'll go over your review of systems . correct me if i'm wrong in any of this . constitutional , you have fatigue and weight gain ; gi , you have excessive appetite and bloating ; eyes have floaters ; cardiovascular shows shortness of breath and leg swelling ; endocrine , you're always hungry ; skin , you have some nail bed changes , dryness , itching ; musculoskeletal , you have gout and muscle pain . and the remainder of the review of systems is negative . [Patient] yep , that's all correct .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , we're going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination . let's look at the right hand first . can you feel this ? [Patient] yeah , but a little less on these two fingers .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Physical Examination][Doctor] sensation is normal , except pin prick sensation diminished in third and fourth fingers on the right . and how about on the left ? [Patient] um , yeah , but these two a little less .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Physical Examination][Doctor] sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left okay , let's test your reflexes now . reflexes are 1+ and symmetric ; 2+ knees ; toes are downgoing bilaterally . all right , i'm going to tap on your right wrist . do you feel anything ? [Patient] yeah , it feels like a zing up my wrist and something into my elbow too .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and how about the left side ? [Patient] yeah , same on that side too .[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] tinel sign positive at both wrists and both elbows . rest of exam is normal . all right , so what i am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or , potentially , this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome . however , your symptom presentation suggests car- bilateral carpal syndrome , as the nerve in your wrists are aggravated by your past trauma . this is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me . [Patient] okay , so how do we make it better ?[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] first , i want to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from . we'll need to schedule you for a nerve test , which is called an emg test . they will measure the responsiveness of your nerves to truly pinpoint where you are having your issues . [Patient] that sounds fine to me .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] great . after the tests are complete , you can return here for a follow-up visit . if you're still having symptoms , we can consider a referral to our hand clinic , possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release se- surgery . you could also refer ... we could also refer you to an orthopedist for the same treatment .

see you today so looking here in my notes looks like you you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on [Patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go [Patient] it's constant[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright are you able to urinate [Patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes [Patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] third time alright [Patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever [Patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain [Patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved [Patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day [Patient] yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so we are getting close there [Patient] okay[SEP][Therapeutic History][Reassessment][Acute Assessment][Doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff [Patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running [Patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the the one eighties which was really high [Patient] right[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that [Patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries[SEP][Discussion][Chitchat][Doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help [Patient] yeah some help could be helpful[SEP][Reassessment][Referral][Medication][Doctor] okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright. so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday [Patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday [Patient] i do[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Physical Examination][Doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that

na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your blood pressure here in the office your blood pressure looks good it's about one twenty seven over sixty which is pretty good on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention there is no carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally and on your musculoskeletal exam your right radial artery cardiac cath site is clean dry and intact there is no hematoma and there is a palpable radial pulse now what does that mean betty so all of that means is that you know you have a little bit of a heart murmur after having the heart attack but i looked on the echocardiogram and it showed that you know you do have mild mitral regurgitation which is just you know a little floppy valve which is is fine we'll just keep an eye on that and then everything else for the most part looks good so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of your inferior myocardial myocardial infarction i wan na go ahead and continue with your aspirin continue on your brilinta you're gon na stay on the brilinta for at least one year and aspirin you're gon na take lifelong until i tell you to okay i wan na go ahead and have you continue on the crestor forty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and put in another echocardiogram for about six months okay do you have any questions about that [Patient] yeah do you think i can no that sounds good i have one other more question though[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Doctor] yeah so at this point you're you know you're out like two weeks and your and your cath site is looks good so you can go ahead and and resume swimming now with that being said i would want you to just do a few laps here and there i do want to enroll you into cardiac rehab that's gon na give you a bit more confidence to go back to exercising and they also give a lot of dietary education and counseling in cardiac rehab does that sounds like something that you can do [Patient] yeah i think i have to[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay i agree alright i also want you to go ahead and continue with your toprol fifty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and order a some liver function studies and a lipid panel to follow up with the next time we meet and i want to see you again in probably six weeks okay

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there . [Patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ? [Patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] right . [Patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] wow , that's remarkable . [Patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .[SEP][Discussion][Lab Examination][Doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it . [Patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference . [Patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] absolutely . [Patient] my red blood cell count has increased .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though . [Patient] stable .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think . [Patient] yeah . , is it ?[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good . [Patient] nice , that's good news .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so . [Patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me . [Patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] well , your levels are high . [Patient] are they right now ?[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] well , i mean they were last time . [Patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ? [Patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] all right . [Patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Reassessment][Doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well . [Patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .[SEP]","460":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi jerry , how are you doing ?

but are you when you're like while you are at school like has anybody been sick i know like with you know covid has been going around but like have you noticed anybody like that sick all the time around you [Patient] sick all the time everybody is sick these days[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] alright [Patient] so[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] but what about at home how about your siblings are any of them sick [Patient] most of them are healthy yeah most of them are healthy although you know i have a brother who smokes i have told him not to smoke he does n't listen[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] house told not to smoke at the house but you know anyway[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct [Patient] yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay [Patient] sure[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain [Patient] no[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerular nephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment [Patient] how much are all these tests going to cost[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them [Patient] okay that's that's good to know[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today [Patient] okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] and right after that i have to go to work[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh [Patient] well yeah this new job there is no insurance and my old boss sucks so i'm hoping i'll get a new boss and you know hopefully some free food with with this ut because it's had a restaurant so we'll we'll see how that goes[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] we might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we do n't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay [Patient] got it[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] alright okay so do you have any more questions before i send my nurse in [Patient] do i need to get a shot today[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] no shots today just stopped [Patient] okay and when do i have to come back for the results[SEP]","462":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] alright brittany so i see that you are experiencing some right foot pain could you tell me what happened [Patient] yeah well i was playing tennis and i was trying to you know volley the ball[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] it was like a double game and i was trying to volley the ball and i got in front of another player and actually ended up falling on top of my foot[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright [Patient] and then yeah it kinda hurt i quickly then twisted my myself around her because i was trying to catch myself but then i started to feel some pain in my foot[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm okay have you ever injured that foot before [Patient] yeah no sorry i injured my other foot before not this foot[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so right now you're experiencing right leg pain but you have injured your your left leg before is that what i'm hearing [Patient] yeah that's fine[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright were you able to continue playing [Patient] no i had to stop i actually it was like i had to be held from the field because i could n't put weight on my foot[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm sorry okay so what have you been doing for the pain since then [Patient] i wrapped it after a the game they had some ace wraps in their clubhouse and so i wrapped it up and then i iced it last night and i just kept it up on a pillow and then i took some ibuprofen[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay could you one more time when did this injury happen [Patient] this happened about couple days ago[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so did you say whether does the ibuprofen help at all [Patient] yeah it helps a little bit but then you know it it you know after a while it wears out[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numb numbness or tingling [Patient] no no numbness[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright any loss in sensation [Patient] no i mean i i can still feel like i can still feel my foot[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay alright that's good to hear so you were playing tennis is that what you normally do to work out [Patient] i do i'm trying to learn but i can not afford tennis less lessons so me and my friends just hit the balls back and forth i do sleep[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i love it absolutely yeah my dad one time took me to play racquet ball and i learned the very bruisy way that that was n't for me yeah [Patient] that scares me[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] it's it they they move pretty fast i'm not gon na lie alright so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my my physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings but if you have any questions go ahead stop me let me know but i will be explaining along the way okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so i've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great you know your blood pressure i see is one twenty five over seventy that's almost textbook respiratory rate we are seeing you at a smooth eighteen excuse me your temperature you're running normal ninety seven . one you're you're satting at a hundred percent so and then your pulse so that's interesting like you're you're going at like about sixty beats a minute so i think they're i think we're doing pretty well i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop we have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam i do appreciate a little bit of stridor that's really interesting but i do n't hear any wheezes or rales so that's great for your i know this sounds weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt [Patient] no uh uh[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Radiology Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions [Patient] yeah do i have to do the surgery[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so i'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot if you do n't it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flat-footed you can also develop arthritis in that foot so yes i i i highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with [Patient] i just hate that word surgery doc[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] so it's actually [Patient] have to be in the hospital[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] no no no no no it's actually a day surgery and you'll be able to go home the same day and then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week you'll be in a cast and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do so the procedure itself is not very long you will and so like since you will be able to go home that's great but you wo n't be able to drive especially since you're saying are you left handed or right handed [Patient] i'm right handed[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with so no you're gon na you're gon na need somebody to take you home but what [Patient] i mean[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] i really wan na keep on playing my tennis with my friends but[SEP]","463":"[Conversation Start][Acute

just kinda bend and straighten for me [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good patellar patella tracks fine no crepitus alright let's go back to this medial side you're tender right there is that right [Patient] yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Physical Examination][Doctor] it's tender on the medial joint line but actually negative mcmurray negative lateral side negative mcmurray good so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts [Patient] yeah sometimes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like [Patient] walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] you actually no [Patient] yeah it hurts no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] what about you i mean are you real weak [Patient] no i would say i'm pretty

[Patient] i quit complaining okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yes sir work harder [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] do you do you play sports in in college or high school [Patient] i did in high school[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids [Patient] no[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] just kinda you're thinking walking the dog [Patient] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee [Patient] no no i have n't would you recommend that[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it's pretty bad [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] we'll get we'll get to that too [Patient] okay[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today [Patient] yes[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay do i go into that to [Patient] yeah[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it [Patient] you're only cup of this[SEP][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Other Treatments][Doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Other Treatments][Doctor] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] does that make sense [Patient] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses [Patient] okay[SEP]","473":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 . hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ? [Patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [Patient] yes , i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [Patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Other Socials][Doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [Patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 . [Patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yep , right here . [Patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [Patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .[SEP][Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [Patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [Patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , good . [Patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ? [Patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ... [Patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [Patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you . [Patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated . [Patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [Patient] okay , thank you . got it .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ? [Patient] no , not that i know of .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right .

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Follow-up][Doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [Patient] okay , i will do that .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future . [Patient] okay , that's okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not . [Patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range . [Patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .[SEP]","474":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey charles i'm using this cool new recording device to help me with my documentation is that okay with you [Patient] sure[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] awesome how are you doing today [Patient] well i could be better you know i moved out in the city about two years ago bought this big plot of land[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] awesome. you be hunter [Patient] huge hunter i love hunter[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] you want to carry share sure yeah we can switch [Patient] nice but so the thing is i have noticed that for some reason my breathing is n't what it used to be[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] you look pretty healthy [Patient] thanks  so do you[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] thank you you you're feeling short of breath [Patient] yes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay is there you know is there any other symptoms that you have with that [Patient] i get like you know mid shortness of breath suddenly for some reason i'm not quite sure why[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] i always think it's allergies[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i have a dog that eyes water like that she always gets eyebugers [Patient] yeah i get eyebugers too[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay great do you ever notice a rash with any of this [Patient] no[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] do you have any nausea vomiting [Patient] no[SEP][Drug History][Vegetative History][Doctor] besides when you go out heavy drinking right [Patient] i mean i diarrhea quite a bit once i go out[SEP][Drug History][Vegetative History][Doctor] i understand that [Patient] heavy drinking[SEP]","475":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi russell how are you what's been going on [Patient] well i've been having this sharp pain on the right side of my abdomen below my ribs for the last several days i saw my doctor and they ordered a cat scan and said i had a kidney stone and sent me to see a urologist[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay well does the pain move or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot [Patient] yeah it feels like it goes to my lower abdomen in into my groin[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go [Patient] it comes and goes when it comes it's it's pretty it's pretty bad i feel like i ca n't find a comfortable position[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee [Patient] yeah it kinda burns a little bit[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay do you notice any blood [Patient] i do n't think there is any you know frank blood but the urine looks a little dark sometimes[SEP]","476":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] patient is julia jones , date of birth 5\/16\/1996 . she is a new breast reduction consult . hello , how are you doing today ? i'm dr. gonzalez . it's nice to meet you .

[Patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad . [Patient] yes , that's correct .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ? [Patient] yeah , that sounds good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today . [Patient Guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense . [Patient Guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wow . okay . [Patient Guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ? [Patient Guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel . [Patient Guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mhm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ? [Patient Guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] got you . okay . [Patient Guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] hmm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Chitchat][Doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ? [Patient Guest] only pepcid .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ? [Patient Guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ? [Patient Guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ? [Patient Guest] yes , that is correct . he did .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ? [Patient Guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that . [Patient Guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care . [Patient Guest] you're welcome .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ? [Patient Guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned . [Patient Guest] um , this is what she sent me , \" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . \" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .[SEP]","482":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi abigail how are you today [Patient] hello hi nice to meet you i'm i'm doing okay[SEP]","483":"[Conversation Start][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] . next patient is michelle king . date of birth : 05\/07\/1982 . please use toc template . she was admitted to district regional hospital on 06\/29\/2021 , and was discharged on 07\/02\/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to , uh , prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ? [Patient] not too bad . and yourself ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ? [Patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on . [Patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high . [Patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] typically , it does n't . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive . [Patient] yeah , that's what they said .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ... [Patient] hm .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] uh , they did n't do a ct scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ? [Patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in . [Patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , maybe that's all it was . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ? [Patient] yes , i am .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] great . so here are my thoughts . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ? [Patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ? [Patient] sure , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see . [Patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing . [Patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ? [Patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ? [Patient] i am unvaccinated .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ? [Patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] correct , we do n't . [Patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as \" vaccine injury \" .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] right . [Patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that . [Patient] all of them ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ? [Patient] no , i do n't .[SEP]","484":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03\/04\/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ?

[Patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , i see . [Patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm , okay . [Patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though . [Patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ? [Patient] uh , no .[SEP]","485":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey elijah how are you [Patient] i'm doing okay[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so i see here that your primary care provider sent you over it looks like you were doing some yard work yesterday and dropped a landscape brick on your foot can what so what's going on with your right foot today [Patient] it's a little sore today but you know i hurt my foot before but this is the first time where i'm actually being seen for it[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so you say you've injured your right foot before tell me a little bit about that injury [Patient] twenty years ago i broke my ankle i had to put in a cast but that seems to be okay but you know sometimes it'll give me trouble once in a while it feels a little sore it swells up at times[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright so when you dropped that brick on your foot were you able to get up and keep working or did you have to get off your you know not stop weightbearing and and get off that foot can you tell me a little bit about after the traumatic incident [Patient] i you know it was a little sore i called a few names you know god damn why is this in my foot but you know i kept working putting it around a little bit but now it's got swollen so i got to see my doctor he told me i had to go see you here i am so tell me what's going on with it[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so what have you been doing for the pain since the initial insult [Patient] lucken it up[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you taken any medications safe for example tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain [Patient] no i feel like taking the medicine[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay and then just out of curiosity you said you were doing some landscaping have you been over to landscapes warehouse new here in town my wife and i were just over there this last weekend and picked up a whole bunch of stuff you had a chance to make it over there yet [Patient] no not yet i heard about it though i might have to make a trip once my foot heals[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright that sounds good now just out of curiosity can you rate your pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life [Patient] eleven out of ten[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numbness or tingling of that foot since the incident [Patient] yeah the whole foot is numb[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Follow-up][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay i'm gon na do a quick physical exam now your vitals look good and i would like to do a focused exam of your right foot the there is some bruising on the bottom part of your foot and on the top part as well and i do appreciate the associated swelling and i also recognize that you do have tenderness to palpation for midfoot now for your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is brisk in less than three seconds i do note a strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse with motor and sensation is intact for that foot i also like to call out the fact that it matches bilaterally which is important i'm gon na go ahead and review the diagnostic imaging results so we did a x-ray of that right foot and i do notice dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to your second metatarsal bone and the top of your foot this is where the metatarsals meet those cuboids okay so it where the bones come together in your foot now there are a lot of ligaments in your foot so i do want to order an mri just to assess if there is any injuries to those ligaments now based on your exam and looking at the x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery now the reason why this is important is if we have poor bone alignment or ligament healing you can this can lead to losing the arch in your foot you could becoming flat-footed and also developing arthritis now what's gon na be key here is the surgery is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly we are going to put them back into place using plates and screws now the key thing is going to be it's going to be outpatient surgery so it's going to be same day i'll see you in the morning and then you'll be discharged home that evening and we will do a follow-up i wan na see you in twenty four hours post procedure but then i'll see you again in two weeks you're gon na be in a cast and i'm gon na have you use crutches you're not gon na be able to weight-bear on that foot for six to eight weeks what we'll do is we'll advance your ambulating gradually based on how you heal and based on how you tolerate the procedure i know i have covered a lot of material quickly but this is really gon na be the best course of action for you to have a good outcome now do you have any questions come answers concerns before i have the nurse come in finish the paperwork and get you set up for your procedure which we are going to do tomorrow if you're agreeable to that [Patient] what about putting in a cast can i just stay in the cast[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] you could but what we found is the best outcome is aligning those bones with plates and screws to make sure that they heal properly so you have the best outcome possible [Patient] so if the surgery is going to be tomorrow when am i going to get my mri[SEP]","486":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] yeah so sorry so barbara is a 31 -year-old female and she has history of diabetes type two and asthma and she is here today with abdominal pain so barbara tell me a little more about your abdominal pain what's been going on [Patient] so i've been having this pain for the past one week and as you know i have a longstanding history of diabetes and i guess i've been drinking too much coffee lately i do n't know if that triggered my gastritis so[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay alright and so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what [Patient] it's gradually increasing for sure[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright and along with the pain have you had any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea [Patient] nausea and vomiting is on and off[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay okay and and so and you vomited how many times [Patient] a couple of times[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright been drinking a lot of coffee you said too uh is that is that starbucks i love those nitrocolbrus and starbucks we ever had those those are incredible [Patient] yeah[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] that's [Patient] and the venti[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] yeah the for sure you got ta go venti on that you really have to coax them into it though they wo n't even give you it's it's like you need a license to get a venti on that that nitro it's so strong so that's my achilles heel i tell you but okay so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain uh you you you you've been drinking more coffee and maybe that's related as you're thinking [Patient] yeah i think so because i started last week and towards the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad so i've been controlling myself this week and you know i i probably just had one cup[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay yeah okay and so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it [Patient] it's on both the sides of my upper abdomen[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] hmmm okay [Patient] so i it also increases when i work out like if i wan na jog or like go for a run my abdominal pain just like spikes you know so i have to take it easy[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright understood you've not had any fever with that pain have you [Patient] no i have n't[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright and so how about your diabetes how's your diabetes been doing how your blood sugars been what low one hundreds two hundreds where where is it [Patient] i think it's been under control it's eight hundred so[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay good and you're still taking the metformin five hundred milligrams once a day right no actually it looks like last visit we increased that to five hundred milligrams twice per day is that correct [Patient] yes that's probably helping me keeping it under control so[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay good good and then for your asthma have you had any recent asthma attacks and are you still taking the flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed for wheezing [Patient] yes but sometimes i forget you know i have n't had any asthma attacks lately so i just figured i could decrease[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yep okay [Patient] i think that's a good decision though[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Follow-up][Medication][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Acute Assessment][Drug History][Doctor] yeah well better to stay on the flovent daily and then just use the albuterol if you need it but if you stay on the flovent daily it will decrease the frequency of those attacks so yeah alright well let's go ahead and examine you okay so on your physical exam it's pretty normal for the most part unremarkable but i i'll i'll say on your on your heart exam you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam and and i'm not worried about that we're kinda watching that but it just means i hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving and otherwise normal heart exam for your abdominal exam you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen your abdomen's otherwise soft there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever and there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant so i think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen so i think that you know that may be you may be right this could be some gastritis so so then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam you do have some mild end expiratory wheezes very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam so let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here so first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain i do think that you have acute gastritis and i think this is probably related to the caffeine intake and i i know that you've had a a moderately heavy history of alcohol use too so i want you to cut back on the alcohol as well you know keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great and then also cut back on the caffeine and that should help and i'm going to write you a prescription for zantac as well as we need and so i'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain and then i'm going to check a urinalysis a urine pregnancy test a cbc a comprehensive metabolic panel as well and we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on and then for your second problem of diabetes type two let's continue you on the metformin but i wan na adjust the dose slightly i'm gon na increase the morning dose to one thousand milligrams and the evening dose we can keep at five hundred so we'll go metformin one thousand milligrams in the morning and five hundred milligrams in the evening please continue to check your blood sugars let me know what they are when you come back you know we just keep track of those and then we'll see you back in four weeks by the way i wan na have you follow up with me in four weeks and for your third problem of asthma let's continue you on the flovent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily and then also albuterol as needed so how does that sound for a plan any other questions comments suggestions [Patient] that sounds good and i also feel like i'm eating been eating a lot of spicy food[SEP]","487":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hey gabriel i'm doctor scott good to see you today i know you've heard about dax is it okay if i tell dax a little bit about you [Patient] sure[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] okay so

back [Patient] well i was working in the yard and you know bent over to pick something up and i got this pain and you know across the lower part of my back and then it went down my left leg and you know it's been going on for about four days and just does n't seem to be getting any better[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay are you a big gardener or this is something that you just started working in the yard [Patient] yeah i know my wife held a gun to my head make me go out there work in the yard and carry some stuff around it's not my not my first choice but[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] sure sure [Patient] but that day i i lost the i lost the argument[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah yeah that happens to all of this so when this back pain happened so it was basically you were lifting you were bending down to lift something up and you had the sharp pain going down your right leg you said [Patient] left leg[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] left leg okay got it sorry and any weakness or numbness in your legs or just the pain mostly [Patient] in in certain positions i get some tingling but no mostly just pain[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and any loss of bowel or bladder function at all or anything like that [Patient] no[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and have you had any back surgeries or back problems in the past or this is kind of the first time [Patient] no surgeries you know i've i've had back pain occasionally over the years[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you had any any have you tried anything for pain for this have you tried any any medications at all [Patient] i've had ibuprofen it it helped some[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay got it alright well i'll i'll examine you in a second but before we do that let's talk about some of the other conditions that we're kinda following you for i'm looking at your problem list now and you've got a history of diabetes and you're on metformin five hundred milligram twice a day and your how are you doing with your blood sugars and your and your diet and exercise [Patient] yeah i i check my sugar two or three times a week most of the time it's in that one twenty to one forty range[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that [Patient] yeah she still makes cookies and i still eat them but you know we are trying to trying to do better trying to stay away from more of those carbs and focus on you know less carby less sweet stuff[SEP][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under balance so i'll order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check that again today and and you know just reemphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important and then we'll have those results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] for your high blood pressure your blood pressure in the clinic looks pretty good it's about one twenty over seventy right now we have you on norvasc five milligrams once a day how are things going with that are you are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all [Patient] yeah i guess i check it maybe once a week or two or three times a month and it it the vast majority of the time when i check it it's good usually either that one twenty to one thirty over seventy to eighty range i i think the blood pressure's okay[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay is that new or is that been going on for a while [Patient] well it it started maybe i do n't know a month or two after i started the norvasc[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah i mean certainly it could be it is you know sometimes that medication can cause that so i'll i'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright so and your anything else bothering you today [Patient] no i'm we're doing okay i think[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] so let me examine you for a second i'm gon na go ahead and gabriel i'm gon na do my magic exam now let's pretend i i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings as i do my exam and so [Patient] these are like my video visit exams[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] exactly so your neck exam has no jvd there is no bruits that i can hear your lung exam no rales no wheezing on your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past so i'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam you do have some tenderness on the left paraspinal area right where i'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal you have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paraspinal area of your back when i palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam you do have this one plus nonpitting edema of your lower extremities which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign no signs of blood clot that's what that means so let me just review what you know explain what all this means so the back pain the first problem that you're here today for i think this is more of a muscular sprain i'm gon na recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory naprosyn five hundred five hundred milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it does n't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now i would start with that if that's okay with you any questions about that [Patient] no[SEP]","488":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] next patient is sophia jackson , mrnr472348 . she's

[Patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ? [Patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's the 250\/50 dose , correct ? [Patient] yes , correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ? [Patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ? [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ? [Patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity . [Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ? [Patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no kidding , that's great . [Patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] really ? [Patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ? [Patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ? [Patient] probably about three or four .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ? [Patient] yes , that's correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ? [Patient] i do .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then . [Patient] nope .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ? [Patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ? [Patient] correct .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ? [Patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ? [Patient] yeah , that's right .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ? [Patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ? [Patient] yeah , it does , it works great .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ? [Patient] yep , that's correct .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ? [Patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it . [Patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ? [Patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment . [Patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","491":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] hi betty how are you i i read in the medical records that you ended you did end up having a heart attack they ended up putting a stent in your right coronary artery how are you doing [Patient] i'm thankful to be alive but definitely struggling and definitely scary time for me[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah you know i'm i'm i'm glad that we went ahead and sent you to the emergency room now i know that you were in the hospital for about forty eight hours how are you feeling since you've been home you've been home a couple of weeks now how are you doing [Patient] yeah they told me to really take it easy so i've just been you know doing very light work i i i do n't really do much outside of just you know sitting around and taking my medication but i would say i'm doing okay i feel like i have you know a little it i do n't feel perfect but i feel better than you know i did[SEP]","492":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] patient's name is diana scott . date of birth , 12\/8\/1920 . the date of service is 7\/9\/2021 . this is a new patient note . good afternoon . how are you today ? [Patient] i'm good , thank you .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good . well , what brings you in to see me today ? [Patient] well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ? [Patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur . so of course , i'm worried as well .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ? [Patient] i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one . so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ? [Patient] no , i definitely do n't .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ? [Patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain . um , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ? [Patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ? [Patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know . maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] got it . all right . [Patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all . um , maybe more if i try to overdo it .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ? [Patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago . before that i did n't notice anything at all .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ? [Patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ? [Patient] yeah . so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and so how about any passing out at all ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , good . and how about irregular heartbeats ? do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ? [Patient] i do n't notice it at all .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ? [Patient] yeah , my ankles swell .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and how long has this been going on ? [Patient] um , i would say for probably six months . but it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ? [Patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] mm-hmm . okay . [Patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ? [Patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ? [Patient] i'm not really sure .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ? [Patient] yeah , you name it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ? [Patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment . [Patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke . but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay , i see . [Patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ? [Patient] correct .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . well , let's do a quick exam . [Patient] all right . sounds good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ? [Patient] no , i feel fine .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , great . all right . well , that is it for the exam . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] and i can order that for today . um , do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long . [Patient] yes , that's fine . i have time .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay , great . so we will complete that today , um , to assess your overall cardiac structure and function , as well as , uh , the valve view of where diseased . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Doctor] and some hospital outcomes and what we might suggest to fix that out , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called , um , aortic stenosis , and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open , um , quite fully . and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body , and that's called the aorta , into the rest of your body . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement , or we just call it tavr . and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve . [Patient] well , i would have to think about that . i'm not too sure i'd wan na do that , given my age of all .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah , sure , no problem . and we do n't have to make any decisions today , just , you know , wanted to go over a couple of these things . um , but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement , or it's called an savr . but really , because of your age and medical history , um , unfortunately , that would n't be a good option for you . [Patient] i see . okay . well , i guess we'll see , um , what you see from , from the , um , test .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , agreed . okay . and , um , so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we're not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril . so just continue taking those as you are currently . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP]","493":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] so stephanie morales is a 36 -year-old female today complaining of her ankle pain and she also has a history of diabetes and high blood pressure so stephanie tell me what's going on with your ankle [Patient] well we had a long spring and the other day we got some snow and ice i was walking to my car and i slipped and my left ankle kinda turned underneath me[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and so this happened couple days ago or how many days ago [Patient] two days ago[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] two days ago okay and so it's your left ankle and it kinda just twisted underneath you on the kind of on the inside [Patient] yeah more on the it's more on the outside of my hips[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and did you fall down or did you just kind of cut catch yourself [Patient] no i fell[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and were you able to get up afterwards or somebody helped you up [Patient] i was but it was very sore and then started swelling and quite a bit of pain so it's hard to walk[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] sure have you tried anything for pain or the swelling or anything like that [Patient] ibuprofen some ice and elevation[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay has that helped much or not really [Patient] a little bit[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and any pain above your ankle does it hurt on your on your calf or your lower leg at all or knee at all [Patient] no it's mostly just the outside of my ankle[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay got it and no bleeding or i'm sure it's a little swollen probably [Patient] yeah it's swollen but no bleeding[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well i'll have you take off your shoes in a second we'll examine you in a second but since you're here and i wanted to talk about some of your other things that you know we have n't i have n't seen you in a year so let's talk about your history of diabetes as well are you taking the metformin how's your blood sugars been how how're you managing that any issues with that [Patient] no they've been pretty stable[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you're checking your sugars regularly as well [Patient] yes[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] okay your hemoglobin a1c last time i looked at epic was about six . eight which is really good so i think you're doing a great job we had talked about you know cutting off the sweets and sugars and stuff like that and exercising so it sounds like you're you're you're doing a pretty good job with that have you seen the ophthalmologist recently for your eye exam for your diabetes checkup or no [Patient] i am due for one of those in the next couple of weeks[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay alright so we'll so you do you already have an appointment or do you need to make an appointment for that [Patient] i have an appointment[SEP]","494":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi logan , how are you ?

the 5k tack you know sometimes the marathon and i have n't been doing longer distances because [Patient] when i'm running i my right knee here it just starts to ache and it's it's just to the point where i need your opinion[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay okay what have you done for it so far what makes it better what makes it worse [Patient] well it used to be that when i run it ache and then i put ice on it and then it would be okay so i do ice and ibuprofen[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay okay and did you see anybody for this before coming into the office here [Patient] yeah i doctor wood is my primary care provider and i talked to him about it actually over the years and this last visit he said he referred me to you[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay okay good so ice and rest makes it feel better running and and activity makes it hurt a little bit more is that correct [Patient] yeah that's right[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay do you have any family history of arthritis or any of those type of immune diseases [Patient] i'm trying to think no i do n't think so no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and do you get is it is this primarily worse in the morning or does it is it just there all the time when it comes on [Patient] it actually is worse towards the end of the day[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so let's go ahead and i want to do a quick examination here your blood pressure and was one twenty over sixty that's phenomenal your heart rate was fifty eight and you can tell that you're a runner with that that level of a heart rate and your respirations were fourteen so all of that looked very good there was no fever when you came in when i'm gon na just quickly listen to your heart and lungs okay those those sound good but let me get let's focus here on your lower extremities i'm i'm gon na look at your your left knee first when i move your left knee do you get any type of pain or is it just feel like normal and it's always your pain's always isolated to the right [Patient] that feels that feels normal[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay okay so let me i just want you to back up here in the stretcher a little bit more and i'm just gon na do some movement of your knee any okay so i want you to push your leg out against my hand does that hurt [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay and if you pull back does that hurt a little bit [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay and i'm gon na move it around so when i look at the knee there is no redness there's no swelling i can appreciate a a small amount of effusion and that means that there's a little bit of fluid under the knee or in that knee's joint space and there is there is several reasons that could be now when i push on your knee does it hurt more on the inside or does it hurt more on the outside here [Patient] the the right knee here hurts on the outside[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay okay and you've got a good pedal pulse so you know you can feel that and when i touch your feet you do n't have any numbness or tingling or anything like that [Patient] no uh uh[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Medication][Radiology Examination][Referral][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay well so what i want to tell you is that i think you have a knee sprain from overuse and we see that sometimes in runners now unfortunately you're gon na have to take some a little bit of time off of of active running but i do n't think it will be that long until we can get you up and running again now i reviewed the x-rays that we did when you first came into the office here this morning and the joint spaces of that right knee are are well maintained i do n't see any evidence of any fracture and when compared to the left knee everything looks good so i do n't even see any signs of any arthritis that i would've been suspecting i would like you to stay on two tylenol five hundred milligrams and two ibuprofen two hundred milligram tablets and i want you to take that three times a day and that's gon na help with both the pain and the inflammation i'm also gon na order some physical therapy for your your right knee and that physical therapy will help strengthen the lower extremities and make it give you a little bit of a balance and some they'll be able to recommend good running exercises for you i do wan na follow up with you in two weeks and see if we're getting better so let's no running for two weeks and if we're we're improving then we'll move on and probably start adding some additional activity does that sound like a plan [Patient] yeah that does i i was curious so i will lay off the running for now can i you know lift weights and do like my squats and and those type of exercises at the gym[SEP]","501":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi , roger . how are you ?

kind of pain do you get with it [Patient] it's almost like a throbbing pain but occasionally it becomes almost like a a sharp stabbing pain especially if i move it or spend too much time walking i i

when this started [Patient] no i do n't that's the thing i do n't remember an injury if it was something that i injured i think i would have just ignored it and would n't have showed up here but when it got red and warm to touch that's when i i was really concerned[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay do does even light pressure to it bother it like at night when you're laying in bed do the sheets

for taking me in i appreciate it[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] sure absolutely what can i help you with today [Patient] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now [Patient] i have an albuterol inhaler[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night [Patient] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens [Patient] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and then when you use your inhaler [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] does it does it alleviate the problem [Patient] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler [Patient] okay[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] for the symptoms [Patient] yes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so [Patient] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that [Patient] no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening [Patient] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Drug History][Doctor] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems [Patient] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having [Patient] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation [Patient] so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] and then we can talk a little bit more [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and everything sounds good let me take a look at your eyes [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Physical Examination][Personal History][Doctor] and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that [Patient] yeah i think so yeah[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] and i'm gon na look in your mouth too [Patient] okay[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] and throat looks fine no tonsils [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal [Patient] awesome[SEP][Follow-up][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair mm-hmm and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that in terms of the mood is this new for you [Patient] yeah i think so like when i started this year[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that [Patient] yeah[SEP]","505":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] patient , bruce ward . date of birth 5\/21\/1969 . please use my neuro consult template . this is a 52-year-old male with dia- newly diagnosed pituitary lesion . the patient is seen in consultation at the request of dr. henry howard for possible surgical intervention . mr . ward presented to his primary care provider , dr. howard , on 3\/1\/21 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months . he denied any trouble with headaches in the past . his past clinical history is unremarkable . worked out for worsening headaches was initiated with brain mri and serology where pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered . i personally reviewed the labs dated 3\/3\/21 including cbc , unes , uh , coagulation , and crp . all were normal . pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low tsh , all other results were normal . um , i personally reviewed pertinent radiology studies including mri for the brain with contrast from 3\/4\/21 . the mri reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm . the ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are lo- are noted . hello , mr . ward . nice to meet you . i'm dr. flores . [Patient] hi , doc . nice to meet you .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] i was just reviewing your records from dr. howard and he's referred you because the workup for headaches revealed a mass on your pituitary gland . i did review your mri images and you have a significant mass there . can you tell me about the issues you've been experiencing ? [Patient] yeah sure . so i'm really getting fed up with these headaches . i've been trying my best to deal with them but they've been going on for months now and i'm really struggling .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] where are the headaches located and how would you describe that pain ? [Patient] located behind my eyes . it's like a dull nagging ache .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . was the onset gradual or sudden ? [Patient] well it started about three months ago . and they've been getting worse over time . at first it was like three out of 10 severity , and it just gradually worsened . and now it's about six out of 10 severity . the headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and it feels like a dull ache behind the eyes . they last a few hours at a time , nothing makes them better or worse .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . can you tell me if the pain radiates , or if you have any other symptoms ? specifically feeling sick , fever , rashes , neck stiffness , numbness , weakness , passing out ? [Patient] no . i have n't been sick or felt sick . ca n't recall a fever or any kind of rash . no- no neck issues , no numbness , no tingling . and i've never passed out in my life . but , um , for some reason recently i seem to be bumping into door frames .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . have you noticed any change in your vision or with your balance ? [Patient] no i do n't think so . my eyes were checked in the fall .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] okay . let's see , do you have any other medical problems that you take medicine for ? [Patient] no i do n't have any medical problems and i do n't take any medicines . i tried tylenol a few times for the headaches but it did n't work , so i stopped .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] i see . anyone in your family have any history of diseases ? [Patient] i was adopted so i really have no idea .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . um , what kind of work do you do ? and are you married ? [Patient] i work as a computer programmer and i've been married for 25 years . we just bought a small house .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] that's nice . um , do you drink any alcohol , smoke , or use recreational drugs ? [Patient] nope . i do n't do any of those and never have .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . um , well let me take a good look at you . um , now you'll hear me calling out some details as i perform the examination . these will be noted for me in your record and i'll be happy to answer any questions you have once we're done .

[Patient] yeah i never noticed that i could n't see out of the side until you did that test , and you closed one eye with both eyes . i really could n't tell .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] no because you're having this vision loss from the mass compressing the optic chiasm , the only option we have is to do surgery . [Patient] okay , i understand . do you think i'll regain my vision ?[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Referral][Other Treatments][Doctor] well there's no guarantees , but it is a possibility . i'm gon na refer you to the eye doctor for a full exam and they'll do what's called visual field test . this will map our your peripheral vision or side vision prior to surgery . and we can monitor after surgery to see if your vision is improving .

[Patient] uh , i , i've noticed that i've been swelling up a little bit . i think a lot of it has to do with going to some house parties , eating some salty foods . i feel really lethargic .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . all right . and when you get short of breath , are you short of breath when you're just sitting here ? do you feel short of breath when you're walking ? [Patient] it's something like walking up a flight of stairs i'll actually feel it .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . all right . now , um , how long has this been going on for ? [Patient] probably about 10 days .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . all right . and you said you're noticed some swelling in your legs ? [Patient] a little bit .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . do you have problems lying flat in bed ? [Patient] um , i'm a little uncomfortable when i wake up in the morning and i feel pretty stiff . and , and , like , it takes me a little while to adjust to walking when i get up .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . all right . do you ever wake up acutely short of breath at night ? [Patient] um , it happened once , probably about a week ago , but it has n't happened since . so i have n't been that concerned about it .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . all right . in terms of your , your diabetes , how are you doing with that ? i know you're on the insulin pump . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] um , are your blood sugars okay ? have you noticed a spike in them recently ? [Patient] um , i have n't . i've been pretty good about monitoring it so i ... during the working week , i stay on top of that . but on saturdays or sundays we're so busy i forget to monitor it . but i have n't seen anything spike .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and i remember your affinity for chocolate bars , so ... [Patient] guilty as charged . i love chocolate bars .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . all right . so , in terms of your depression , how are you doing with that ? [Patient] uh , it's been a crazy year and a half . um , i've tried some natural solutions . in the summer i did stretches outdoors every morning , which was great , but now the weather changed and , uh , you know , i've got ta find some alternatives . i'm not ready to try any medications just yet , so-[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . we'll talk about that . [Patient] sure .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and then in terms of your reflux , how are you doing ? i know we had you on the omeprazole . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you were making some lifestyle modifications , cutting back on your red bull and caffeine . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] alcohol intake has been ... how's that been ? [Patient] tough during the holiday season , but i'm , i'm better .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . all right . and no issues with your depression ? you do n't want to hurt yourself or anyone else ? [Patient] no . no . absolutely not .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , all right . well , let's go ahead . i know you did a review of system sheet when you checked in and you endorsed the shortness of breath . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] any other symptoms ? chest pain , fever , chills , cough ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] um , belly pain ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . let's go ahead . i want to move on to a physical exam . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] hey , dragon ? show me the vital signs . so here in the office , you know , your vital signs look good . your , your pulse ox ... that's your oxygenation level ... looks good . so i'm encouraged by that with you just sitting here , okay ? i'm gon na go ahead and do another , uh , just check you over . i'll let you know what i find . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . all right . so , on your exam things look okay . so , i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distension or any carotid bruits on your neck exam . on your heart exam , i do appreciate a slight 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur . on your lung exam , i do appreciate some crackles , bilaterally , at the bases . and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate 1+ pitting edema . so what does all that mean ? so , i do think that you're retaining some fluid . it's probably from some of the dietary indiscretion . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP]","516":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] hey steven so i see that you're here and you've been experiencing some back pain for a while could you tell me a

better or worse [Patient] yeah like lying on my side makes me feel better[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and then you said that standing also makes it worse right [Patient] yeah if i stand for a while[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and then have you experienced any like loss of control of like your bladder or your bowels [Patient] yeah i pooped myself once[SEP][Vegetative

i'm not sure what they were though[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright and i see in your chart here that you had physical therapy did you feel that that was effective [Patient] no i feel like i could do them the same exercises at my house like they charged me and like it[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay but did the did the exercises help [Patient] i mean i guess a little[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay not a so not as effective as we would have liked did they put you on any pain medications [Patient] yeah it was just a white pill i'm not sure what it was[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay do n't worry i think i can look that up in your chart i just wan na make sure that we have the story straight alright so i know that you said that you mentioned that you played basketball you know before how how like what's your activity like now [Patient] i mean i sit at home all day[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay that's a pretty okay that's a pretty significant weight gain well i i just have a few more questions have you do you know if any of your family members have spine conditions [Patient] i think my fourth cousin has scoliosis[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay okay but that's that's a little distant but anybody direct like sister brother mom dad [Patient] i do n't think so i mean i do n't even my dad though[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay okay and then do you have a personal history of smoking [Patient] what type of smoking[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] any smoke you do n't have to tell me exactly but [Patient] okay[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] have you smoked [Patient] next maybe that i have n't[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] are you it's okay i'm your doctor i'm not here to judge you i just want to make sure that i'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you i need to know this information so one more time do you smoke or have you smoked before [Patient] okay i smoked[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it [Patient] i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay you have [Patient] too many questions are you the fit[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm your doctor i have to [Patient] are you the fence you sound like the fence next question[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Drug History][Doctor] okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things [Patient] sent them off yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] pardon [Patient] because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen[SEP][Physical Examination][Drug History][Doctor] you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt [Patient] yeah it hurts[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay and when you bend backward does it hurt [Patient] a little bit[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up [Patient] stop[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the [Patient] what does that mean like am i dying[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay [Patient] that's a big word[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Acute Assessment][Doctor] those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something [Patient] i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] alright [Patient] can i get pain pills too[SEP]","517":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi diane , how are you ?

alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Other Treatments][Doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Other Treatments][Doctor] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] does that make sense [Patient] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary [Patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this [Patient] okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right [Patient] okay alright i think that sounds good[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] did you get did you select you last night [Patient] i did[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] you yeah what do you think what do you roof for [Patient] i so i i'm a little heart broken right now i was for the rockets and the way that these nets are crushing them it's just it's just painful[SEP]","521":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] okay hi wayne well i understand you're here for

[Patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , maybe that's all it was . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ? [Patient] yes , i am .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] great . so here are my thoughts . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ? [Patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ? [Patient] sure , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see . [Patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing . [Patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ? [Patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ? [Patient] i am unvaccinated .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ? [Patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] correct , we do n't . [Patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as \" vaccine injury \" .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] right . [Patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that . [Patient] all of them ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ? [Patient] no , i do n't .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint . [Patient] well , i am open-minded to this .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] the er is full of these vaccines . [Patient] i understand .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion . [Patient] well , that's what i'm here for .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency . [Patient] sure .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ? [Patient] will do .[SEP]","530":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi logan . how are you ?

almost a year and then things just started getting really stressful at work they started laying people off and i'm happy i still have a job but that also meant that i was responsible for more things so things just got stressful and i and just started picking it up again[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] well you are absolutely correct you know stress can often be a trigger for things like smoking and drinking have you thought what you would do this time when you encountered the stressful situations [Patient] yeah i i did n't think about that a lot actually and one thing is i have started learning and trying to do more meditation and then i also just recently joined the gym so i'm really looking forward to working out again[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Drug History][Doctor] okay well that's great to hear that you're getting back in the gym that will be good for your long term health too you know helping to maintain that type two diabetes you know those are really great strategies talking

Examination][Discussion][Follow-up][Medication][Acute Assessment][Drug History][Doctor] so let's talk a little bit about your exam here okay i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam and i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good including your oxygen saturation blood pressure for today was one twenty eight over eighty eight heart rate was sixty eight respirations were sixteen and your pulse ox was ninety eight percent on room air so those were all really good now on your heart exam you do have a nice regular and your your rate is of regular rate and rhythm or i'm sorry your heart exam for your heart exam notice that your heart is regular in rate and rhythm i do however still appreciate that two over six systolic murmur that we talked about in the past now that's okay we'll just continue to monitor that now for your lung exam i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your lungs your lungs are clear and equal bilateral with no expiratory wheezes and no rales or rhonchi are appreciated on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy when i listen i do n't hear any extra noises so i do n't hear any hearing any carotid bruit which is a good thing now for my impression and plan let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem of nicotine dependence first of all i just want to apply you on making this first step to stop smoking and i want you to know with absolute one hundred percent certainty that i'm gon na be with you every step of the way i think it's fantastic that you're very welcome i i i think it's fantastic you've chosen next monday as a quit date and on that day i'm gon na start you with a twenty one milligram nicotine patch and the goal will be to decrease that over time okay now we will work together to decrease that so there is no necessarily hard dates in mind okay be sure to change the patch location each day and that's going to help reduce or avoid that skin irritation that can occur if you use the same location over and over again i would like to see you again in two weeks just to see how things are going and we will reevaluate at that time the dosage for your nicotine patch now we also see further need to discuss any handouts you received today for those common smoking triggers i really want you to keep an eye on and monitor your stress level not only about work but also the fact that you are experiencing are going to be be a new father and we really want to watch any stress you will be experiencing around the birth of your new child so please keep an eye on that and let

time[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Reassessment][Doctor] okay so for your other conditions that we talked about briefly your second condition of type two diabetes we'll let's go ahead and continue to

your diabetes checkup or no [Patient] i am due for one of those in the next couple of weeks[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay alright so we'll so you do you already have an appointment

need a refill on that yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay alright well let me examine you here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my match exam and i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put that into my record okay so your neck exam is fine there is no bruits your lungs are clear your heart exam is normal you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is i think you probably have an ankle sprain but i would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone and i'm sometimes worried about a fracture so i'm gon na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you [Patient] that's a great plan i need to get back to exercising so[SEP]","546":"[Conversation Start][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09\/18\/1949 . patient was called

[Patient] i'm doing okay , thank you .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed . [Patient] yeah , that would not be good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery . [Patient] yeah , that's right .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive . [Patient] yeah , i noticed that too . i think the oxyglutinine is helping as well . my urgency to use the bathroom is much better .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well that's great . [Patient] yeah , i , i'm pleased about it too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ? [Patient] yeah , i had leg cramps the other day , but i thought it might , was maybe just because i was cold as i had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep . i had cramps when i woke up in both legs right here . um i drank pickle juice and it went right away .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well do n't , do n't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it . [Patient] haha , i know , i only drink about 4 ounces or so .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay good . [Patient] um it went away so i did n't drink anymore . i find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] sure just , just keep it in moderation . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Vegetative History][Doctor] and then are you still on an iron supplement ? and are you using the bathroom okay ? [Patient] uh yes , everything is good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ? [Patient] no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] great . [Patient] um and after i stopped taking that um i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ? [Patient] uh yeah , that's right .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great . [Patient] good , that's a relief to hear .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though . [Patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march . [Patient] all righty .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today . [Patient] all righty that sounds good .[SEP]","547":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hi billy how are you what's been going on the medical assistant told me that you're having

sixty to seventy [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] that's that's that's not too bad i think when you first came in you were around like one eighty so it seems to be that that norvasc is is working for you how about your diet i know you were having a little issue eating some fast food and and cakes and cookies and have you been able to get that under control [Patient] yeah it's hard to give up the fast food altogether because it's a lot of on the go you know[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay so do you think you would be able to get that

are passed this time but i do want to get a couple of labs so we'll get a urinalysis [Patient] okay[SEP][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] alright we'll get a urine culture just to make sure everything is is cleared up i also want to give you a referral to referral referral to urology [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Doctor] because you do keep having these all the time and so maybe there's something else going wrong and so they can help get that under control [Patient] can i see doctor harris[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Doctor] of course yeah we can we can get you that road to doctor harris and [Patient] he's not like[SEP][Medication][Other Treatments][Reassessment][Doctor] he's great he's he's he he he's great i've heard he does really good work so that'll be good so for the hypertension you seem to be doing well on the two . five of norvasc so we are not gon na make any changes to that do you need any refills right now [Patient] no usually the pharmacy just sends them through when i call[SEP][Referral][Doctor] okay great so we we wo n't we gave you refills with that i do wan na give you a consult to nutrition [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Other Treatments][Doctor] just to help you with that diet [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] because i think that's a major factor of us eventually getting you off of all medications [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Discussion][Reassessment][Doctor] and then for your diabetes i'm just keep you on that on that five hundred of metformin okay i think you're doing well with that as well also but i do want you to start taking your blood sugars if you can take them before every meal [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] just to gauge where you are so you can tell how much food you should actually be be eating [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] alright [Patient] i can try that[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so how does that that sound [Patient] that sounds like a plan when should i come back and see you[SEP][Follow-up][Personal History][Doctor] so you can you can come back in three months and we'll check up again i forgot you did tell me last time that you were having some issues with insomnia [Patient] hmmm[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] how is that going for you is it still happening [Patient] i mean sometimes i stay awake just kinda worrying about things but but i've tried some meditation apps and that helps[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright and i know we talked a little bit before about practicing proper sleep hygiene you know just making sure that all of your electronics are off you know dark room [Patient] yeah[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] cool room have you been doing that [Patient] well i do like to sleep with the tv on and my phone is right by my bed because i never know if someone's gon na call me you know[SEP][Referral][Doctor] yeah i i know i'm like apple i do n't know if you have an iphone or not but i know apple has this the the sleep mode now do that disturbance so you put that on [Patient] it's a good idea[SEP]","557":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12\/27\/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ? [Patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad . [Patient] yes , that's correct .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ? [Patient] yeah , that sounds good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today . [Patient Guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense . [Patient Guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wow . okay . [Patient Guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ? [Patient Guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ? [Patient Guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel . [Patient Guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mhm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ? [Patient Guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] got you . okay . [Patient Guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] hmm . okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Chitchat][Doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ? [Patient Guest] only pepcid .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ? [Patient Guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ? [Patient Guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ? [Patient Guest] yes , that is correct . he did .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ? [Patient Guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that . [Patient Guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care . [Patient Guest] you're welcome .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ? [Patient Guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned . [Patient Guest] um , this is what she sent me , \" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . \" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ? [Patient Guest] correct . yep .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did . [Patient Guest] yes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ? [Patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ? [Patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ? [Patient] no , not that i've noticed .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um- [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today . [Patient Guest] okay . thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Other Treatments][Doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead . [Patient Guest] okay . that sounds good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and does ashley play any sports ? [Patient Guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .[SEP][Other Treatments][Doctor] how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water . [Patient Guest] okay . great . we will work on that .[SEP][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses . [Patient Guest] we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well .[SEP][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have come all the way out here . [Patient Guest] okay . that sounds great .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse . [Patient Guest] no . i do n't have any additional questions , and i'll- i'll definitely give you a- a phone call if we do . and thank you so much . this was so helpful .[SEP]","558":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] hi jaqueline how are you i heard that you injured your ankle [Patient] yeah it's not going so great[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] what what happened to your ankle [Patient] well i was doing something i did n't really want to be doing and i fell and now my ankle hurts[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay well what were you doing were you hiking or biking or what were you doing [Patient] i was in a mountain biking messenger[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] you were in a mountain biking lesson and you fell off your bike and twisted your ankle [Patient] yes[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and what ankle was bothering you [Patient] the right one[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] your right ankle okay and did it twist like did your ankle twist outward or did your ankle twist inward do you know [Patient] my ankle twisted outward[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] your ankle twisted outward and where are you having the most pain is it is it kind of like right on your outer ankle or is it more in your foot [Patient] outer ankle[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] it's in your outer ankle okay alright and do you have any numbing or tingling in your toes at all [Patient] i have some tingling i have no tingling i have some numbing going on and some numbing going on in other places[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] really like where [Patient] my heart[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright well i'm an orthopedic person so i ca n't talk to you about your numbing hearts okay now are you able to move your ankle [Patient] a little bit[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] are you able to walk on your ankle [Patient] not really[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] are you limping [Patient] yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] you're limping okay have you taken anything for the pain [Patient] i've taken tylenol[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] you took tylenol [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay did that help at all [Patient] no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] no it did n't help alright did you hear anything pop or anything like that when [Patient] i heard like an like a crack crackle so[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] you heard a crack [Patient] yeah[SEP]","559":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] hi kyle how are you today [Patient] i'm doing well i'm just anxious about my pcp told me that i had some abnormal lab work and why she wanted me to be seen by you today[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah i bet that did make you nervous i i see that she referred you for a low immunoglobulin a level is that your understanding [Patient] yeah i mean i do n't even really understand what that means but yeah that's what she told me[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah that's a mouthful [Patient] yeah[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] it it's the the one of the antibodies in your body and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections it's a little bit low i'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you i just have a few more questions okay so let's start again here [Patient] i'll do this[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] i i think i would break that [Patient] yeah i just saw that[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] if you can do that [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah so we'll we'll just [Patient] okay[SEP]","560":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12\/27\/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ?

[Patient] well no uh it's just her face[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay okay yeah that would be great to see that because i wan na see what's going on so thank you for that tell me is there any family history of seizures or like tourette's syndrome [Patient] well no history of seizures but i i i never heard of that tourette thing[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah so so toret is that it's a nervous system disorder that you know involves like repetitive movements or like unwanted sounds and it typically begins in childhood and i do n't know have you noticed anything like that with her when she was younger [Patient] really i had nobody in our family got anything like that[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay now tell me have you noticed any other symptoms how about like fever or chills [Patient] no[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay coughing headache [Patient] ma'am[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay how about any problems with karen's sleep [Patient] nope[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay okay good let's go ahead and do physical exam on karen here alright karen i'm just gon na take a look at you and and ask you to follow some commands okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright can you follow my finger with your eyes good now can you do me a favor walk across the room for me great job okay now i want you to close your eyes and reach out your arms in front of you good now keep your eyes closed can you feel me touch you here how about okay how about there [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] does that feel the same [Patient] yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright so i'm just gon na check your reflexes okay alright now on your on the neurological exam the patient is awake alert and oriented times three speech is clear and fluent gait is steady heel toe walking is normal and the cranial nerves are intact without focal neurologic findings there is no pronator drift sensation is intact reflexes are two plus and symmetric at the biceps triceps knees and ankles so this means everything looks good karen [Patient] that's great[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Doctor] good alright so i'm gon na go ahead and tell you what we're gon na do so i'm gon na tell you my assessment and plan here so dad so for the first problem i do believe that karen does have a tick eye tics are very common in children and as many as you know one in five children have a tick during their school years and tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging facial grimacing sniffling excessive throat clearing and uncontrolled vocalization i can say that essentially they're brief sudden and involuntary motor movements now we do n't have a full understanding of the cause of the tics but they typically occur around five to ten years of age but most ticks go away on their own and they disappear within a year so these are what we call transient tics and the best thing to do is ignore the tics so it does n't seem to be bothering karen and she seems to be doing well in school and activities so it may wax and wane over time but you might notice it more towards the end of the day when the child is tired so you may also you know see it if they're stressed so that's why it's important to just ignore it now when you draw attention to the tick it does make the child conscious so that can make the tic worse so we want to be careful again just to to kind of not to draw too much attention on it and do you have any questions for me [Patient] so you mean you're telling me you do n't think he had a seizure or a bit or nothing[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah i do n't think it's i do n't think so because it's it is the same part of her body that's moving every time that and she reports that it's somewhat of an there is an urge to blink her eye and some relief afterwards [Patient] so you're not recommending any kind of treatment there is no pill or cream or nothing[SEP]","562":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Therapeutic History][Doctor] all right . this is matthew rogers . date of birth 5\/24\/2007 . i would like to use the acne

History][Doctor] i'm good so i see we are here you had a recent diagnosis of stage three nonsmol cell lung cancer and so we are following up on your neo adevant chemotherapy so you can you tell me how you're doing today [Patient] yeah you know i'm i'm doing okay i have a little bit of some shortness of breath that i noticed over the weekend and you know i i'm i considered myself pretty active before this i would walk my dog around the block and now i i ca n't even walk you know down the street without being short of breath[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay yeah yeah i mean that's that's definitely understandable it says you had a four point four centimeter left upper lobe nodule in there so it's kinda big but that's understandable and we're doing the chemo to try to reduce that that that tumor that you do have so how often do you normally run with your dogs [Patient] i mean i would i would take them for i would normally take them for like mile long walks everyday and just this weekend i could only walk down to the end of the street i had to have my husband take the dog fit walk[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] man okay what kind of dog do you have [Patient] i have a dobrman[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] yeah they are pretty active that makes sense alright so have you been coughing have you had any phlegm [Patient] i've been having a dry cough no phlegm[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay have you noticed any fever [Patient] no fever[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] no fever alright what about any other symptoms like any body aches any sore throat sinus pain [Patient] well i mean now that you mentioned it like every time i swallow it hurts it does n't feel like i have a cold because it hurts down here more in my chest but every time i swallow it it's really painful[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay so when you are swallowing i know some of my patients feel this do you feel like the food is getting stuck [Patient] no the food is not getting stuck it just hurts[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay what about when you're you're taking liquids are you able to take in both hydrocort liquids [Patient] i mean i definitely feel like over the weekend i have n't been taking it as much because it hurt so much but i i am able to i am able to drink and i've been taking ensure and things like that i had a milk shake[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay that's that's that's that's good yeah we we definitely want you to to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you wo n't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though [Patient] it's very helpful you know as you can understand i'm just like devastated when i got this diagnosis and i'm just i'm just trying to figure everything out and but he is very good and my daughter is is very helpful too and i you know i think for the most part i'm very fortunate to have them[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so how how are you feeling on your chemo see you're on a combination of sysplatin and a topicide you had your last dose a few days ago any nausea any fatigue from that [Patient] i was a little nauseated and tired but i took the zofran that you prescribed and that seemed to help and you know i i got some rest it's it's it's been okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Medication][Therapeutic History][Radiology Examination][Reassessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay that's good so let me do a quick physical exam on you just gon na check your vitals here so your vitals are normal your pulse ox is okay so everything's good with that so i'm gon na feel your neck on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy no subclavicular adenopathy your heart exam regular rate and rhythm no murmur your lung exam so i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally that's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath so that could mean you have some fluid in there and that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis so i'm gon na look at your skin exam so on your skin exam on your chest i do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side and that could be due to that radiation sometimes patients do get a radiation burn and it's it'll get better with time especially once you're done with the the radiation treatment and on your extremity it there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me you did get a chest x-ray it looks like you do have mild radiation umitis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so your first diagnosis you know is is the lung cancer so we are gon na continue you on that chemo regimen on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses i think you're on forty five grade yep you're on that and then when the when the regimen's complete we'll do some more testing and hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor so that has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out so for your second diagnosis the radiation pneumonitis i'm gon na prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams one tablet a day for five days have you been on on a steroids before [Patient] no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Reassessment][Doctor] i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] alright so do you have any questions for me [Patient] no[SEP]","566":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] good afternoon , beverly . good to see you .

[Patient Guest] i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ?

[Patient Guest] uh , this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] and then he got another bottle , and he barely ate that . um , i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] so , he varies i guess .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps , or does he have pretty good energy ? [Patient Guest] mmm , it seems like he's irritable .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] irritable because he is n't feeling good ?

[Patient Guest] yes , his older sister's been sick .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] thank you . [Patient Guest] we also had a play date with my nephew , who i learned later had a sinus infection .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and what medication have you tried for him ? anything at all ? [Patient Guest] um , i've been doing the saline mist in his nose .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] good , good . that's a good choice . [Patient Guest] i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him , and we had the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i see . and , any other medications ? [Patient Guest] we did put some baby vick's on his feet last night to try and help him breathe . and , i also used the humidifier .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . that's good . [Patient Guest] okay . okay .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ? [Patient Guest] i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] is it a dandruff shampoo ? [Patient Guest] no , i do n't think so .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps . [Patient Guest] okay , sounds good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] can you take a big breath randy . [Patient Guest] where's mama ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too . [Patient Guest] yeah , it's okay buddy .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over . [Patient Guest] dino , you're doing so good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down . [Patient Guest] hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like . [Patient Guest] all right . thank you .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine . you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well . [Patient Guest] okay . okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough . [Patient Guest] mm-hmm , got it .[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough . [Patient Guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine . [Patient Guest] okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yes , zarbee's . [Patient Guest] and then you said , uh , which medicine to give him just in case ?[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] right , does that make sense ? [Patient Guest] yeah , yeah . that makes sense .[SEP]","569":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Therapeutic History][Drug History][Doctor] amanda taylor , birth date october 31st 1949 . patient is a 72 year old woman who comes for followup for hypertension . her history includes significant alcohol use disorder and mi- mild hypercholesterolemia . at last visit on april 16th her blood pressure was 130 over 90 . after presenting at 150 over 100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams by mouth once daily , and lisinopril 20 milligrams by mouth once daily . cmp and cbc were essentially unremarkable . hi miss taylor , how are you today ?

[Patient] yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ? [Patient] mm , no .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ? [Patient] yes . yes i am .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ? [Patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be . [Patient] right , mm-hmm .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Vegetative History][Doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] have you received your coronavirus vaccine ? [Patient] yes , on february 9th .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , great . all right well i'm just going to look at your ankles and feet , i'm looking for any signs of swelling . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Reassessment][Doctor] all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you . [Patient] yeah i agree with that .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges . [Patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it actually will help with both . [Patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better . [Patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse . [Patient] yeah , sure , sure .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good . [Patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have . [Patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ? [Patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Follow-up][Doctor] then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing . [Patient] all right that sounds good .[SEP][Medication][Other Treatments][Drug History][Doctor] all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose . [Patient] all right , sounds good , thank you .[SEP]","570":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hi good afternoon joseph how are you doing today [Patient] i'm doing well but my my

doing out of the ordinary when this started [Patient] no i do n't that's the thing i do n't remember an injury if it was something that i injured i think i would have just ignored it and would n't have showed up here but when it got red and warm to touch that's when i i was really concerned[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay do does even light pressure to it bother it like at night when you're laying in bed do the sheets bother [Patient] absolutely i was just gon na say when i'm in bed at night and those sheets come down on it or i roll over yeah that hurts a lot[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay have you done anything to try to get it to feel better any soaks or taking any medicine [Patient] i take you know like a two ibuprofen a day and that does n't seem to help[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let me see your your foot here and let me take your big toe through a range of motion if i push your top to bottom [Patient] yeah ouch[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] big toe joint that okay and let me move it up where as i bend it up does that hurt [Patient] it hurts but not as much as when you moved it down[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay so i'm moving it down here and it i've got about ten degrees of plantar flexion does that hurt [Patient] yeah it a little when you take it a little further[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] if i go a little bit further to twenty degrees does that hurt [Patient] that hurts more yeah[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay if i push in on your big toe and move it back and forth does that hurt [Patient] yes it does and it it's almost like those joints that when you push it back it's almost like it's grinding a little bit too[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay if i push in between your big toe and your second toe here does that hurt [Patient] a little bit but not terrible[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay what about if i push on the other side here [Patient] yeah yeah right there on the outside of it absolutely[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Radiology Examination][Doctor] okay and i'm feeling a little bit of bone spur here as well let me let me get an x-ray [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] and after we take a peek at that we'll develop a plan [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] so at this point what would i do if i'm going out of the room and then coming back [Patient] you could hit pause or hit the stop button and just restart it the next time you come in[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] okay alrighty so taking a look at your x-ray and you do have you you have a large spur there on the top of your big toe joint [Patient] oh[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] and you've lost a lot of the cartilage [Patient] oh[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] and so you you've got some arthritis in there we we call this hallux rigidus and treatment for this to start off with we we put an insert in your shoe called an orthotic and we give you a little bit of anti-inflammatory medication or like a drug called meloxicam you only have to take it once a day [Patient] okay[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it's usually pretty well tolerated have you ever had any trouble with your stomach [Patient] no never never had any problems with my stomach i love the i love the mexican's food the hotter the better so i hope i never get a problem with my stomach[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i hope you do n't either one of the things that we get concerned about with an anti-inflammatory like that is that it can irritate the stomach so if you do start to notice that you're getting heartburn or pain right there [Patient] yeah[SEP]","571":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] okay michael so i see in here that you're

the rest of their life i question their choices it's fine okay but are you when you're like while you are at school like has anybody been sick i know like with you know covid has been going around but like have you noticed anybody like that sick all the time around you [Patient] sick all the time everybody is sick these days[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] alright [Patient] so[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] but what about at home how about your siblings are any of them sick [Patient] most of them are healthy yeah most of them are healthy although you know i have a brother who smokes i have told him not to smoke he does n't listen[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] house told not to smoke at the house but you know anyway[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct [Patient] yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay [Patient] sure[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt [Patient] no[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain [Patient] no[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerular nephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment [Patient] how much are all these tests going to cost[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them [Patient] okay that's that's good to know[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today [Patient] okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] and right after that i have to go to work[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh [Patient] well yeah this new job there is no insurance and my old boss sucks so i'm hoping i'll get a new boss and you know hopefully some free food with with this ut because it's had a restaurant so we'll we'll see how that goes[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] we might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we do n't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay [Patient] got it[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] alright okay so do you have any more questions before i send my nurse in [Patient] do i need to get a shot today[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] no shots today just stopped [Patient] okay and when do i have to come back for the results[SEP][Follow-up][Doctor] i need you to come back in a week [Patient] okay can we do that over the phone by the way[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] we could if if your results are normal but

[Patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [Patient] yes , i did .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [Patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Other Socials][Doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [Patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 . [Patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] yep , right here . [Patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . [Patient] that would be great .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . [Patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .[SEP][Medication][Discussion][Doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . [Patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [Patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [Patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay , good . [Patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ? [Patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ... [Patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [Patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you . [Patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated . [Patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [Patient] okay , thank you . got it .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ? [Patient] no , not that i know of .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] all right . [Patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ? [Patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] okay . we might give you some of that . [Patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ? [Patient] yes , i also do have that problem .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .

[Patient] and , uh , i do n't know . maybe i must have toppled over into some weird position , so it started to pain since then , uh , because of a certain move .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , uh- [Patient] i went overboard , i think . yeah .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , lem me , uh , take a quick look . uh , can you move up a little bit ? yeah .

[Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] so i would , uh , suggest you continue using the pain reliever , maybe just like 600 milligram of ibuprofen three times a day and use it for a week .

[Patient] a week , okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] and then if you ... if it's still painful , you can use , uh , ice or , um , heat pad- [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] .

[Patient] yes , ma'am .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] well , it looks like you have one stone in the left kidney but it's not obstructing anything . [Patient] i knew it had to be a kidney stone . i passed what looked like two small stones last week after i scheduled this appointment . and then for the past six weeks , i've had a few episodes of bright red urine the color of , like , cherry kool-aid . and last week , i was constantly having to pee and it hurt something terrible .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] how bad was your pain on a scale of zero to 10 ? zero being no pain and 10 being worse , as you can imagine . [Patient] um , at the time , i'd say an eight .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back ? [Patient] no , after passing those stones , things have felt a lot better .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Vegetative History][Doctor] that's good to hear . now , it looks like you're only taking alavert 10 milligrams a day and have no drug allergies . is that correct ? [Patient] that's right .[SEP][Discussion][Reassessment][Doctor] all right , let's take a look at you today . let's use my default pe . well , mrs. wood , we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones . fortunately , you passed two last week and the blood has nearly subsided . you do still have one stone in the left kidney . since it's not obstructing or causing pain , i do n't recommend any surgical intervention at this time . [Patient] i'd like to know what i can do to stop getting these stones .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] as we discussed last time , the formation of kidney stones can not be attributed to a particular cause . but several factors increase the risk , such as dehydration , family history , certain foods , digestive tract disease and certain medical conditions . [Patient] yeah , i know i do n't drink near the amount of water that i should . i drink more mountain dew than anything .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] you should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day . [Patient] so , if i weight 250 pounds , i should drink ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] that would be 125 ounces of water a day and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like mountain dew . [Patient] okay . is there any food i should n't eat ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] great question . you should avoid food rich in sodium oxalate and animal protein . so that would be salty , processed food because they're high in sodium . ideally , you should consume less than 1,000 milligrams of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef , poultry , fish , and pork . [Patient] what's oxalate ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] it's an organic acid found in plants , that when digested , it binds to minerals that stones are formed from . foods like spinach , chocolate , beets , rhubarb and soy products . [Patient] well , i'll do whatever it takes to try to avoid getting these stones again .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] great . and here's a handout that you can look over . it goes over the dietary recommendations and what to avoid .

little high also weigh yourself daily and call me if you gain three pounds in two days okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] and i

problem for your hypertension i want you to continue on the cozaar one hundred milligrams daily continue on the norvasc five milligrams once daily also and i'm going to order a renal artery ultrasound

[Patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] no kidding , that's great . [Patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] really ? [Patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ? [Patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ? [Patient] probably about three or four .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ? [Patient] yes , that's correct .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ? [Patient] i do .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then . [Patient] nope .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ? [Patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ? [Patient] correct .[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ? [Patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ? [Patient] yeah , that's right .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ? [Patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ? [Patient] yeah , it does , it works great .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ? [Patient] yep , that's correct .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ? [Patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .[SEP]","587":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] alright so

[Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ?

[Patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it . [Patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ? [Patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment . [Patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point . [Patient] all right , that sounds good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh . [Patient] ahh .[SEP]","597":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] hey philip good to see you today so take a look here at my notes i see you're coming in for some right knee pain and you have a past medical history of hypertension and we will take a look at that so can you tell me what happened to your knee [Patient] yeah i was you know i was just doing some work on my property and i i accidentally slipped and fell down and i just still having some knee issues[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay well that that's not good do you [Patient] no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] what part of your knee would you say hurts [Patient] i would just say you know the it it you know it basically when i when i'm flexing my knee when i'm moving it up and down and i put pressure on it[SEP]","598":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] morning christine , nice to see you .

[Patient] yup .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . great . all right . well , let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam . so looking at you , you do n't appear in any distress . your heart is regular . your lungs sound nice and clear . you have some tenderness to the right lower quadrant to palpation of your abdomen . your lower extremities have no edema . um , all right . well , let's go ahead and look at your labs , okay ? [Patient] yup .[SEP][Reassessment][Radiology Examination][Lab Examination][Medication][Doctor] hey , dragon , show me the hemoglobin . yeah , so your hemoglobin is 8.2 , which is quite low for somebody of your height and weight , so we'll have to look into that a , a little bit further . i know that they did the endoscopy in the emergency room . hey , dragon , show me the endoscope results . good . so it looks like you had some gastritis , which is just inflammation of your stomach and they also found a slight polyp , which i know that they biopsied and the results are pending at this time . um , so , you may have had some bleeding from the gastritis . it's not usual for people to have bleeding from that . um , okay , well , hey , dragon , show me the anemia panel . okay . anyway , okay . well , vincent , i think , you know , in terms of , my impression of you is that you've had this newfound anemia and for that , i think that we should go ahead and put you on protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day to help with the gastritis . does that sound okay to you ? [Patient] it does . you're the doctor . i do n't know what it is .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so that's just , uh , what we call a proton pump inhibitor which , uh , helps decrease the amount of acid secreted within your stomach . [Patient] got it . makes sense .[SEP][Other Treatments][Medication][Drug History][Doctor] hey , hey , dragon , order protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day . and i'd like you to try to cut down on your caffeine 'cause that can also irritate your stomach . try not to take any ibuprofen and try to cut down on any alcohol intake , okay ? [Patient] yup , yup . the coffee's the hard part .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah . it always is . how about one , one , one eight-ounce cup a day ? okay ? [Patient] sure .[SEP][Follow-up][Doctor] um , and we'll go ahead and we'll see you in a couple weeks , okay ? [Patient] sure thing .[SEP]","610":"[Conversation Start][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] next patient is sophia jackson , mrnr472348 . she's a 57 year old female who is here for a surgical consult . her dermatologist referred her . she biopsied a 0.7 millimeter lesion which was located on right inferior back . pathology came back as melanoma . mrs. jackson , it's good to meet you . [Patient] likewise , wish it were under better circumstances .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah , i hear your dermatologist sent you to me 'cause she found a melanoma ? [Patient] yes , that's what the biopsy said .[SEP]","611":"[Conversation Start][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] . next patient is michelle king . date of birth : 05\/07\/1982 . please use toc template . she was admitted to district regional hospital on 06\/29\/2021 , and was discharged on 07\/02\/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to , uh , prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ? [Patient] not too bad . and yourself ?[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ? [Patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on . [Patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high . [Patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] typically , it does n't . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive . [Patient] yeah , that's what they said .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ... [Patient] hm .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] uh , they did n't do a ct scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ? [Patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in . [Patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , maybe that's all it was . [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ? [Patient] yes , i am .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] great . so here are my thoughts . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ? [Patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ? [Patient] sure , i can do that .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see . [Patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing . [Patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?[SEP]","612":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] so elizabeth is a 53 -year-old female today complaining of chest pain and she has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure so elizabeth tell me what's going on with your with your chest pain [Patient] i do n't know every time i start walking i'm just having this kind of pressure and chest pain in my chest[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay are you having it now or is it gone right now [Patient] right now it's not there[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and how long have you been having this [Patient] probably maybe three months[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and what seemed to bring it on anything exacerbated or relieve it [Patient] it mainly happens when i'm walking i like to try and walk but lately i just have n't been able to keep up with it because i'm having this pain[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright and well how would you describe this pain it's like a dull pain sharp pain stabbing pain how would you describe it [Patient] i would say it's dull it's kinda like a pressure[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and does it go anywhere or radiate any place [Patient] no[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay alright but no chest pain right now no shortness of breath no sweats or clamminess or anything like that right now [Patient] nothing right now[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay alright well certainly you know i looked at your ekg that did we did in the office when you came in the ekg i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so i'm you know we should definitely talk about the plan for this chest pain in a few minutes but right now the good news is i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so let's talk a little bit about your other conditions since you are here today how are you doing with your diabetes i know we have you on metformin and we talked about last time about you know improving your diet and exercise i'm glad you're exercising but i'm so sorry to hear about the chest pain so tell me about how is that going [Patient] yeah i mean i think my blood sugars have been a little higher because i have n't been able to be active and i'm trying with the diet you know i do love sodas so i'm really trying strength dose[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah i i am addicted to diet coke myself so i i hear you on that one and we had checked your hemoglobin a1c last time it was you know seven . which is pretty good it's not you know it could be better but it's not it's not bad and we talked about sending you to ophthalmology also for an eye exam have you seen ophthalmology in the last few months or last before i saw you [Patient] i have an appointment in two weeks it was a long waiting[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay got it and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that with your diabetes or any side effects from your medications the metformin [Patient] no[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright good and i saw also there was a record in your i was looking at your record before previously before i walked in you also had we've been checking your blood pressure but but i think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure have you noticed any findings with that or have you know have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that because we do n't have it in our system here yet but i did add it in today but we do n't have you on any medications yet for that [Patient] no i mean i do n't know doc no one told me about high blood pressure do i have high blood pressure[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well i think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the your blood pressure was elevated so they had mentioned that i noticed a trend in your blood pressure it's been running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years [Patient] okay do you think that could be causing me my my chest pain[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so [Patient] someone had told me before[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah me too but we we can we can definitely you know get you started on some monitoring devices for that and also maybe start you on some some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure and maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay [Patient] okay sounds good[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Referral][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness so what does all this mean i'll explain that in a second so basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs so you know with this chest pain i'm a little bit so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily i'm also gon na give you a prescription just a baby aspirin you can take eighty one milligrams once a day and also i'm gon na give you a prescription for nitroglycerin it's a it's a little pill you split underneath your tongue if you have this chest pain if it does n't go away after one or two pills i want you to go to the hospital call nine one one and go to the hospital but we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart okay any questions about that [Patient] so anytime i have a chest pain even if i'm just like walking i have to take that pill[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah if you if you stop walking the chest pain goes away you do n't have to take the pill but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away i would take the pill and see if it goes away if it does not [Patient] how long like how long do i wait to see if it goes away[SEP]","613":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] next patient is randy gutierrez . date of birth , 8\/10\/2020 . please use review of symptoms . all text to write . physical exam , auto text uri . hello , how are you doing today ? [Patient Guest] we're okay , thank you .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] that's good to hear . so , how many days has randy been feeling sick ? [Patient Guest] well , i would say it started around supper time last night .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] last night , okay , and what's been going on ? [Patient Guest] well , he started to get a runny nose .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , and is he stuffy too ? [Patient Guest] yeah . yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , and have you noticed , is his mucous clear right now ? [Patient Guest] it is , it is right now , yes .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and , does he also have a cough ? [Patient Guest] yes , but it's not barky .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] and does he act like he has a sore throat or is he pulling on his ears ? [Patient Guest] well , i know he's been pulling on his ears , yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] you know , he also , he's also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and , any fever you've noticed ? [Patient Guest] i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ? [Patient Guest] yes , he did . yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] and how about this morning ? did he eat his breakfast ? [Patient Guest] uh , this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] and then he got another bottle , and he barely ate that . um , i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . [Patient Guest] so , he varies i guess .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps , or does he have pretty good energy ? [Patient Guest] mmm , it seems like he's irritable .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] irritable because he is n't feeling good ? [Patient Guest] yeah . he is energetic , but it seems like he ca n't go to sleep , like , he's fighting it really hard .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay , and just for the chart , is there anyone , anybody else exposed to him who has been sick ? [Patient Guest] yes , his older sister's been sick .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] thank you . [Patient Guest] we also had a play date with my nephew , who i learned later had a sinus infection .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and what medication have you tried for him ? anything at all ? [Patient Guest] um , i've been doing the saline mist in his nose .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] good , good . that's a good choice . [Patient Guest] i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him , and we had the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i see . and , any other medications ? [Patient Guest] we did put some baby vick's on his feet last night to try and help him breathe . and , i also used the humidifier .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay . that's good . [Patient Guest] okay . okay .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ? [Patient Guest] i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] is it a dandruff shampoo ? [Patient Guest] no , i do n't think so .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps . [Patient Guest] okay , sounds good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] can you take a big breath randy . [Patient Guest] where's mama ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too . [Patient Guest] yeah , it's okay buddy .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over . [Patient Guest] dino , you're doing so good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down . [Patient Guest] hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like . [Patient Guest] all right . thank you .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine . you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well . [Patient Guest] okay . okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough . [Patient Guest] mm-hmm , got it .[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough . [Patient Guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine . [Patient Guest] okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yes , zarbee's . [Patient Guest] and then you said , uh , which medicine to give him just in case ?[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Doctor] i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] right , does that make sense ? [Patient Guest] yeah , yeah . that makes sense .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay , great . and that way you do n't have to share , um , with his sister . [Patient Guest] right , okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] and since he's about half her size , we'll do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon . [Patient Guest] okay . will this information all be in the papers ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yes . and so , if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for five days . [Patient Guest] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is , \" as needed , \" or anything like that . [Patient Guest] mm-hmm , understood , thank you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] you're welcome . [Patient Guest] and the cradle cap ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] what i would do is use something like either head & shoulder's , or selsun blue , or nizoral ad . now , do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . um , cradle cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff . so , those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing 'cause they , um , they are all dead scales , and you still have to brush them off . so , continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil , or something that will help get the scales out , and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not every day , but maybe twice a week . so , two days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then , often , within six weeks or so , you'll notice that the-the cradle cap is just , um , not coming back anymore . but , he has to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes . so , just make sure when you're rinsing his hair you avoid his eyes . [Patient Guest] okay . okay .[SEP]","614":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] all right , new patient , jordan roberts . date of birth : 3\/2\/1972 . he's a 49 year old , uh hm , with hypertension and palpitations . please copy forward his thyroid profile from march 1st , 2021 . hello mr. roberts , how are you doing today ?

[Patient] yeah . that was back in march i think , but my girlfriend and i , we talked about it , and on that day i had a few cups of coffee , and no breakfast . so , i think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] yeah . have you , uh , have you felt it again since ? [Patient] uh , no .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . uh , so tell me about the blood pressure then . [Patient] well , i've had issues with my blood pressure since i was young .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] do you have a family history of this ? [Patient] yeah . a lot of my family does have high blood pressure .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] uh , can you tell me which medications you're taking ? [Patient] my new med is , uh , a combo med , something 40-25 .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . um . yes , i see that in your chart . the benicar hct . it has hydrochlorothiazide in it . [Patient] yeah , that's it . my water pill i call it .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . are you still taking the amlodipine , 10 milligrams daily ? [Patient] uh , yes i am .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] that's- that's a good start on a regimen . are you checking your blood pressure at home , and if yes , what numbers are you seeing ? [Patient] um , every day .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] awesome . [Patient] yeah . every morning , i take it when i get up , and it's been running at about , uh , 146 to 155 lately .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] so you're not down in the 120s yet ? [Patient] no , not yet . well , we're trying to get there though .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . uh , how are you doing with your salt intake ? [Patient] i'm trying to back off of it . i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure . [Patient] sounds good .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] are you doing any exercise ? [Patient] i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great . [Patient] good to hear .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts . [Patient] nope . nowhere .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ? [Patient] uh , no .[SEP][Discussion][Reassessment][Doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone . [Patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try . [Patient] all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room . [Patient] all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay . [Patient] all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon . [Patient] i'll definitely let you know if that happens .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better . um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged . um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure . [Patient] i understand .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","615":"[Conversation Start][Greetings][Doctor] and why is she here ? annual exam . okay . all right . hi , sarah . how are you ?

[Patient] i am taking it . i think it's just a lot has been weighing on me lately .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . um , and do you feel like you need an increase in your dose , or do you ... what are you thinking ? do you think that you just need to deal with some stress or you wan na try a , a different , uh , medication or ... [Patient] i think the , the medication has helped me in the past , and maybe just increasing the dose might help me through this patch .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . all right . and , and what else has been going on with you ? i know that you've had this chronic back pain that we've been dealing with . how's that , how's that going ? [Patient] uh , i've been managing it . it's still , um , here nor there . just , just keeps , um , it really bothers me when i sit for long periods of time at , at my desk at work . so i have ... it helps when i get up and move , but it gets really stiff and it hurts when i sit down for long periods of time .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay , and do you get any numbing or tingling down your legs or any pain down leg versus the other ?

[Patient] yeah , i am . it bothers me when i'm on my feet for too long and sitting too long , just the extremes of each end .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and i know that you've had a coronary artery bypass grafting at the young age of 27 , so how's that going ? [Patient] yeah , i had con- i had a congenital ... you know , i had a congenital artery when i was a baby , so , um , they had to do a cabg on me , um , fairly young in life , but i've been ... my heart's been doing , doing well , and arteries have been looking good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Lab Examination][Radiology Examination][Referral][Reassessment][Doctor] okay . all right , well , let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam . um , so looking at you , you do n't appear in any distress . um , your neck , there's no thyroid enlargement . uh , your heart i hear a three out of six , systolic ejection murmur , uh , that's stable . your lungs otherwise sound clear . your abdomen is soft , and you do have some pain to palpation of your lumbar spine . uh , and you've had decreased flexion of your back . uh , your lower extremity strength is good , and there's no edema . so let's go ahead and look at some of your results . hey , dragon , show me the ecg . okay , so that looks basically unchanged from last year , which is really good . hey , dragon , show me the lumbar spine x-ray . hey , dragon , show me the back x-ray . great . so this looks good . that's also stable from last year . okay . so let's go ahead and , you know , my , my plan for you at this time , you know , from a chronic back pain standpoint , if you need , um , you know , some more physical therapy , and i can refer you to physical therapy to help with those symptoms that are kind of lingering . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , and we can always give you some pain medication if you , if you get some pain periodically with activity . how do you feel about that ? do you need some pain medication ? [Patient] no , i think physical therapy is the right way to , way to start out on this .[SEP][Medication][Referral][Doctor] okay . hey , dragon , order physical therapy referral . and then in terms of your depression , we talked about increasing your prozac , so we'll increase it from 20 milligrams to 40 milligrams . it's just one tablet once a day . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] um , and i'll send those to your pharmacy . does that sound okay ? [Patient] that sounds great .[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] hey , dragon , order prozac , 40 milligrams , once a day . and then in terms of your ... the heart bypass that you've had ... let's go ahead and just order another echocardiogram for you , and i wan na continue you on the aspirin for now , okay ?

[Patient] yes , i am .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] hi . my name is dr. edwards . nice to meet you . [Patient] nice to meet you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] welcome to the gi specialty clinic . [Patient] thank you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] did you have any problems finding us ? [Patient] no , i've been here with my sister once before .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good . so how can i help you today ? uh , the referral i have is for abdominal pain and diarrhea . [Patient] right . so i've had ... i've been having this pain right here in my stomach , like right around here .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] so in the area of your mid abdomen , just below the belly button ? [Patient] correct . i've had the pain on and off for about two years . i finally went to the er and a ... a few months ago and they did a ct scan .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] i saw that . [Patient] yeah . they said they did n't really see anything on the scan .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] yes , i agree . it looked normal . [Patient] the problem is i'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] is the pain there all the time ? [Patient] it's a nagging feeling and it just depends . sometimes it bothers me , sometimes it does n't .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] has this been the case over the past two years as well ? [Patient] more recently in the past couple months , at least with the constipation and diarrhea .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] and before that , how are your bowel movements ? [Patient] they were normal .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] uh , okay . so any blood in your stool ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] do you feel like you have more constipation or diarrhea ? [Patient] probably more constipation .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , so when you're constipated , do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard ? [Patient] i usually do n't go , but when i do , it's hard .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] and how often do you have a bowel movement when you are constipated ? [Patient] about three to four times a week . it's like when i need to go to the bathroom , if i can massage it , it feels like it's moving some and i can eventually go .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and when you have a bowel movement , does the pain change ? [Patient] yeah , it gets a little better .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] and are you eating and drinking okay ? any nausea or vomiting , heartburn or indigestion ? [Patient] none of that .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . so tell me about the diarrhea , how often do you get it ? [Patient] it kinda just depends on what i eat . i think i have a very sensitive stomach . if i eat pasta with a creamy sauce , i'm probably gon na have diarrhea .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and it does n't happen for multiple days in a row or is it just one time ? [Patient] it's usually just one time and then it's over .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] and how's your weight been ? any fluctuation ? [Patient] nice and pretty stable , although i could stand to lose about 25 pounds .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ? [Patient] not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even thought i've never been diagnosed with it .[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi cancer or liver disease ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ? [Patient] i've never had any surgery .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all those are still intact ? [Patient] yup .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ? [Patient] no . i thought that happen when you turn 50 .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] well , that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy , like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants . [Patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain . [Patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ? [Patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ? [Patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ? [Patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ? [Patient] i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ? [Patient] hardly ever . maybe once a month .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] and do you consume alcohol ? [Patient] uh , yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays .[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay . and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ? [Patient] nope .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice . [Patient] what would cause that ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted . [Patient] that's good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly . [Patient] what's that ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon . [Patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged . [Patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] correct . [Patient] so what does that mean ?[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged . [Patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ?[SEP][Medication][Acute Assessment][Doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that . [Patient] so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ?[SEP][Discussion][Drug History][Doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease . [Patient] so what do i need to do ?[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs . [Patient] okay . and then what ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too . [Patient] which medications ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Therapeutic History][Doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ? [Patient] about 18 months .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives . [Patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol . [Patient] okay . i'll call him this afternoon .[SEP]","617":"[Conversation Start][Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] all right . today i am seeing jose james . uh , date of birth 9\/29\/1957 . mr . james is a new patient who's having pain in his left shoulder and elbow . he fell five months ago going up a stairs , and the pain has been present since . hi mr . james , i'm doctor isabella . how are you doing ?

[Patient] sure . so i've been having constant pain in my left shoulder and left elbow for a while , about five months or so . hurts all the time . pretty bad at times .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm . that does not sound like fun . it sounds like you injured it going up the stairs ? [Patient] yes , that's correct . it was icy , and i have to walk up a flight of stairs to my house . i stepped and my feet just went out . fell on my left side . seems like my shoulder and wrist took the brunt . it's been hurting since .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah , that does seem like a likely cause of your symptoms . anything seem to make the pain worse ? [Patient] well , i've always hit the gym and lifted weights . i've been trying to keep with my routine of two days a week , but it's been hard . the pain is worse when i lift , and i have n't been able to lift more than 15 or 20 pounds which is very frustrating .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] mm-hmm . i can imagine it is when you're so accustomed to your routine . [Patient] exactly . i really enjoy my exercise , but over the past one to two weeks , i've stopped hitting the gym because the pain just was n't worth it honestly . i do keep up with my walking , though . my wife and i walk about 30 minutes almost every day . we have done this since i retired from my office job last year .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i do not blame you , mr . james . does anything seem to help the pain that you've tried ? [Patient] not too much . i have iced a bit , but i have not taken anything for the pain . stopping exercise and some ice has helped a bit , but it still hurts enough for me to come to see you .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah , okay . how about any numbness or tingling ? have you felt that at any point ? [Patient] no , doc . just pain . no tingling or numbless , numbness , thankfully .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] understood . understood . all right . well , let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on . [Patient] sounds good . thank you .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . use my general physical exam template . mr . james , i'm going to gently press around your shoulder and elbow here to see where your pain might be stemming from . just let me know when it hurts . [Patient] okay . it hurts when you press there on my elbow and here on my shoulder .[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay . left shoulder and elbow , tender sa space , no warmth , erythema or deformity . positive hawkins-kennedy and neer's test . normal proximal and distar , distal upper extremity strength . intact median radial ulnar sensation and abduction to 90 degrees . normal empty tan , can test . okay , mr . james , w-what i think you are dealing with is impingement syndrome of your left shoulder . i do n't think there's an additional injury or issue with your wrist , but because everything is connected , you're experiencing pain in your wrist because of your shoulder . we do see this type of issue when someone has a fall , so it's good you came to see us , you came in to see us so we could help . [Patient] so what are the possible treatments ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Referral][Doctor] well , we have a few options you can try . first option would be to start with physical therapy . i would recommend two sessions per week as well as any other exercises they give you to do at home . we can start there and if that does n't improve your pain , then we could try a cortisone injection . [Patient] i like the idea of starting with the physical therapy and have a next step if it does n't help . i am not opposed to a shot but would like to try the therapy first .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] all right . great . i'll get a referral order , and they will call you within the next day or two to get you scheduled .
