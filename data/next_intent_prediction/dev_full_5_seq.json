{"src":{"0":"[Acute Symptoms][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . and , um , any shortness of breath ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . all right . um , so let's just talk a little bit about your high cholesterol . how are you doing with the diet ? [Patient] i've been pretty good for the most part . uh , we did a little bit of travel over the last week or so , so the diet was n't great . but , for the most part it's been good .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] okay , i , i know we have you on the , on the crestor 20 milligrams a day . you're doing okay with that , so tolerating it ? no muscle aches , anything like that ? [Patient] no muscle aches .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . and i know you had the , uh , bypass grafting last year . you're doing okay ? [Patient] it's been great .[SEP][Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] no chest pain ? [Patient] other than the congestion , no chest pain .[SEP]","1":"[Personal History][Doctor] and any surgeries in the past ? [Patient] i did have my appendix taken out when i was 18 .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . let's do your exam . uh , so , it's this finger right here . and does it hurt here on your , on this joint up here ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . and how'bout right there ? no ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] right here ? [Patient] that hurts .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . uh , can you bend your finger for me ? [Patient] yeah .[SEP]","2":"[Radiology Examination][Doctor] okay , i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month , and then we'll chat about it when i come in . all righty , mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . now , i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms , and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan . [Patient] so what does that mean ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved so that's all good for me . so really there's , there's nothing to worry about . [Patient] all right so i'll come back in three months ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yep , that's right . [Patient] i do have a question for you though .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , of course . [Patient] do you think i will be able to drive again ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] ah man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range . and that , that definitely could be you . you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that then , ya know , i think it could be possible , um , and i'd be happy to recommend it . now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation . so you could kind of do that preemptively , and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go . [Patient] okay . i kinda figured that anyway but i just thought i'd ask . i do n't like to burden anyone when i just need to run to the store but i also know that i need to be safe .[SEP]","3":"[Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , great . um , well , let me go ahead . i wan na do a quick physical exam . hey , dragon . show me the vital signs . so , your vital signs here in the office look really good . so , you're doing a great job managing your , your blood pressure . your heart rate's nice and low . i'm gon na go ahead and take a listen to your heart and lungs . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] and i'll let you know what i find . okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay . good . all right . so , on physical examination , i , i do n't hear any carotid bruits in your neck , which is really good . you know , your heart exam , i do hear a slight 2\/6 systolic ejection murmur , which i've heard in the past , so that's stable . uh , your lungs are nice and clear , and you do have , you know , 1+ pitting edema bilaterally in your lower extremities . [Patient] okay .so , what does that mean ?[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] you know , i , i think , you know , you're doing a ... it sounds like a doing a good job watching your diet . you could ... you just are retaining a little bit of fluid , maybe just from standing all day . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay ? let's take a look at some of your results . okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP]","4":"[Other Socials][Doctor] yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ? [Patient] correct .[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use . [Patient] yeah i do know that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med . [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] that we had too much , yeah . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","5":"[Conversation Start][SEP][Greetings][Doctor] hi abigail how are you today [Patient] hello hi nice to meet you i'm i'm doing okay[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] good i'm doctor sanchez and i'm gon na go ahead and take a look i saw with your notes that you've been having some knee pain yes that's that's true you know it's been going on for a while i like to run i do jogs i sign up for the 5k tack you know sometimes the marathon and i have n't been doing longer distances because [Patient] when i'm running i my right knee here it just starts to ache and it's it's just to the point where i need your opinion[SEP]","6":"[Vegetative History][Doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?

[Patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . [Patient] okay . i did n't realize that .[SEP]","7":"[Conversation Start][SEP][Greetings][Doctor] hi , anna . how are you ?

of motion there is a negative lachman sign the patient does on cardiovascular exam the patient does have a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse okay well let's just i wan na talk a little bit about i had the nurse do an x-ray on you and i looked at the results of your knee x-ray and it does n't show any acute fracture or bony abnormality which is not surprising based on your injury so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so i think you do have a a lateral a lateral collateral ligament strain based on your exam findings and this this type of injury essentially can be healed by itself you know i do n't think we're gon na need to refer you to surgery or anything like that i want you to go ahead and i'm gon na prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i do wan na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those muscles and areas around that injury then that will make your knee stronger it help prevent future injuries are you able to ice it at all during the day now you said you working you work in sales so you said you're home [Patient] yeah i actually i'm at home so i can ice it and i have been icing it[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and so does that help at all [Patient] it's it it makes it feel better in the morning when i first go to my desk and at the end of the day before bed you know i take ibuprofen so i do n't have swelling overnight but honestly i have a pretty decent threshold for pain so it's not good it's not changing it by much[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or better [Patient] i think i think pretty much for the last two weeks they've remained about the same the the only time i feel like they get worse is when i exert myself doing up and down like gardening in the yard or moving pots and stuff outside that's the only time i felt like it got any worse but nothing to the point where it stayed worse[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Referral][Doctor] okay alright well let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy if you're still having pain then we might have to consider an mri [Patient] okay[SEP]","14":"[Vegetative History][Doctor] yeah the for sure you got ta go venti on that you really have to coax them into it though they wo n't even give you it's it's like you need a license to get a venti on that that nitro it's so strong so that's my achilles heel i tell you but okay so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain uh you you you you've been drinking more coffee and maybe that's related as you're thinking [Patient] yeah i think so because i started last week and towards the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad so i've been controlling myself this week and you know i i probably just had one cup[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay yeah okay and so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it [Patient] it's on both the sides of my upper abdomen[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] hmmm okay [Patient] so i it also increases when i work out like if i wan na jog or like

which is really good so i think you're doing a great job we had talked about you know cutting off the sweets and sugars and stuff like that and exercising so it sounds like you're you're you're doing a pretty good job with that have you seen the ophthalmologist recently for your eye exam for your diabetes checkup or no [Patient] i am due for one of those in the next couple of weeks[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay alright so we'll so you do you already have an appointment or do you need to make an appointment for that [Patient] i have an

over i'm sorry one twenty over seventy you're taking norvasc any issues with that any do you need any refills or anything [Patient] i need a refill on that yes[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay alright well let me examine you here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my match exam and i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put that into my record okay so your neck exam is fine there is no bruits your lungs are clear your heart exam is normal you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is i think you probably have an ankle sprain but i would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone and i'm sometimes worried about a fracture so i'm gon na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you [Patient] that's a great plan i need to get back to exercising so[SEP]","18":"[Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] yeah , sure , no problem . and we do n't have to make any decisions today , just , you know , wanted to go over a couple of these things . um , but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement , or it's called an savr . but really , because of your age and medical history , um , unfortunately , that would n't be a good option for you . [Patient] i see . okay . well , i guess we'll see , um , what you see from , from the , um , test .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , agreed . okay . and , um , so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we're not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril . so just continue taking those as you are currently . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] and then , it also looks like you're taking about 20 milligrams of simvastatin for your lipids . and i will pr- , um , defer to your pcp . however , given you are having leg pain in both your legs , and given your age and no history of coronary artery d- , artery disease , it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin . [Patient] really ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] yeah , um , possibly . he would have to evaluate you , but it is certainly something to discuss with him . so i will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations and then you guys can talk about the statin . [Patient] okay , that sounds great . thank you .[SEP][Medication][Reassessment][Doctor] you're welcome . and then , um , lastly , your hyperthyroidism , uh , i see you're taking levothyroxine . and again , no change here and you can just keep taking that as you have them .

[Patient] yeah , so carotid . yeah-[SEP][Personal History][Physical Examination][Doctor] . yeah , no , uh , your , uh , neck surgery .all right . well let's , uh , examine you here for a second .so it's your , uh , this elbow right here ? [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] and is it hurt- ... tender right around that area ? [Patient] yes , it is .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . can you flex it or can you bend it ? [Patient] it hurts when i do that , yeah .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . and go ahead and straighten out as much as you can . [Patient] that's about it .[SEP]","37":"[Acute Symptoms][Doctor] yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this [Patient] i did not no[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today [Patient] some exercises ice and mobic[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal [Patient] yes it hurts[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Referral][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me [Patient] when can i play basketball again[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball [Patient] i just played the wife with fun[SEP]","38":"[Reassessment][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Medication][Doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound [Patient] that's fine[SEP][Reassessment][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Medication][Doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound [Patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable [Patient] okay that'd be good[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay anything else [Patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] well you know where to find me okay [Patient] alright[SEP]","39":"[Acute Symptoms][Doctor] . and maybe a little weakness in your right leg . um , any other symptoms ? i know we went through a lot .

[Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . so , here in the office , you know , your vital signs look great . they look completely normal , which , which is really good . [Patient] good .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay ? so , i'm just gon na check you out , and i'm gon na let you know what i find , okay ? [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] lean up . okay . all right . so , on your physical exam , everything seems fine . [Patient] good .[SEP]","40":"[Conversation Start][SEP][Greetings][Doctor] hey hi bobby how are you doing [Patient] i'm doing good how are you[SEP]","41":"[Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . so , about four days ago ? [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . um , and what have you taken for the pain ? [Patient] uh , i took some tylenol . i took some ibuprofen .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] mm-hmm . [Patient] i tried ice . i tried heat , but nothing really worked .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and , h- how are you feeling now ? are you still in the same amount of pain ? [Patient] uh , by monday morning , it loosened up a little bit , but it's still pretty sore .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . any other symptoms like leg weakness , pain in one leg , numbing or tingling ? [Patient] uh , i actually felt , um ... i had a struggle in my right foot like dropped foot . i had some struggling with my right leg . i felt that for a while , and it got a little bit better this morning but not much .[SEP]","42":"[Physical Examination][Doctor] all right . any other pain down here in your calves ? [Patient] no .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] no , okay . so on exam you do have some tenderness over the medial portion of your knee over the medial meniscus area . uh , there is no , uh , there is a little bit of tenderness when i flex your , uh , when i , uh , uh , do some valgus stressing on your , on your leg . um , you have normal sensation . so let's take a look at your x-rays . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] okay . hey dragon , show me the x-rays . so looking at the x-ray , um , of your left knee , uh , it appears to be there's no fractures there right now . i do n't see any , uh , there's a little bit of , uh , fluid , uh , but there is no , uh , there's no , um , fracture or there's no dislocation . everything else seems to be lined up properly , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Follow-up][Other Treatments][Acute Assessment][Doctor] so in summary after my exam , uh , looking at your knee , uh , on the x-ray and your exam , you have some tenderness over the medial meniscus , so i think you have probably an acute medial meniscus sprain right now or strain . uh , at this point , my recommendation would be to put you in a knee brace , uh , and we'll go ahead and have you use some crutches temporarily for the next couple days . we'll have you come back in about a week and see how you're doing , and if it's not better , we'll get an mri at that time . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] i'm going to recommend we give you some motrin , 800 milligrams . uh , you can take it about every six hours , uh , with food . uh , and we'll give you about a two week supply . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","43":"[Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that [Patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics [Patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now [Patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that [Patient] yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled[SEP]","44":"[Personal History][Doctor] gotcha what do you do outside of outside of work is biking kinda your thing [Patient] no that was his thing and i think that's why we fell i i should n't trust him but most of the time i go on walks with my dog[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay have you broke up with him already or [Patient] no i did n't know that knee injury was a reason to but now that you've told me maybe we should talk about that[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] we'll talk about that later too [Patient] okay[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] alright so let's take a let's take a peek at your knee here [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] you gon na stick it through the screen or how you're gon na do this alright [Patient] okay[SEP]","45":"[Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] alright and alright no but no fevers with this so since you're here your oxygen level looks pretty good in the clinic it's about ninety four percent on pulse your pulse oxygenation so that's good are you short of breath so when you walk or you or you exert yourself you're short of breath you said right okay and have you and how how is your blood sugar been doing since this has been going on i know you're on metformin how's your diabetes been doing [Patient] not so good you know it kinda going up and down i wear this dexcom[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and [Patient] and morning when i get up they are around one fifty[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright so it's been running a little bit high i know we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time and it was about seven . seven . i think and we had talked about you know improving your diet and improving some exercise but is this blood sugar been high and low or high and normal when you're especially in the last three weeks or has it been going on for longer than that [Patient] i would say about a month[SEP]","46":"[Physical Examination][Doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all [Patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Medication][Doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so do you have any questions about that [Patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just[SEP][Reassessment][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Medication][Doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that

[Patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . i see .

[Patient] uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like .[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ?

[Patient] my grandfather had pancreatic cancer .[SEP]","82":"[Personal History][Doctor] okay got it alright well i'll i'll examine you in a second but before we do that let's talk about some of the other conditions that we're kinda following you for i'm looking at your problem list now and you've got a history of diabetes and you're on metformin five hundred milligram twice a day and your how are you doing with your blood sugars and your and your diet and exercise [Patient] yeah i i check my sugar two or three times a week most of the time it's in that one twenty to one forty range[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that [Patient] yeah she still makes cookies and i still eat them but you know we are trying to trying to do better trying to stay away from more of those carbs and focus on you know less carby less sweet stuff[SEP][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under balance so i'll order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check that again today and and you know just reemphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important and then we'll have those results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay [Patient] okay[SEP]","83":"[Discussion][Medication][Doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] alright [Patient] can i get pain pills too[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] can you [Patient] for pain[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] can you get what now [Patient] pain pills[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have [Patient] i'd say it was n't effective[SEP]","84":"[Conversation Start][SEP][Greetings][Doctor] hi , james , how are you ? [Patient] hi , good to see you .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] it's good to see you too . so i know the nurse told you about dax , i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you . [Patient] sure .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Personal History][Doctor] james is a 57 year old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease and lupus , who presents today with joint pain . so james , what's what's going on ? [Patient] yeah . i've been putting a , a few more miles on the bike each day and , uh , my knees have been killing me , just more so in the last three or four days or so .[SEP]","85":"[Personal History][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay , great , we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been , any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ? [Patient] no , i've been feelin' great .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good . well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind . [Patient] sure .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ? [Patient] okay , that's fine .[SEP][Physical Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation . there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam . okay , you can sit up . um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about . uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further . [Patient] okay , i should n't worry too much then ?[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP]","86":"[Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay okay just a couple questions for you you did say that you have the pain at night in that and you have to you get that numbness into the hand is it in all the fingers [Patient] yeah it seems to happen to all my fingers but i notice it more in my thumb and pointer finger[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay okay and anything into that little into your fifth finger your little finger any numbness there at times no [Patient] sometimes yeah it seems like it's numb too[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay what about your right hand any problems with that hand [Patient] no i do n't seem to have any problems with my right hand so far it's just mostly my left[SEP][Drug History][Doctor] okay okay good and just a couple you know do you how do you have many or do you drink often do you have you know many any alcohol consumption [Patient] i drink usually a a beer or two on fridays and saturdays on the weekends[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay and do you have any evidence of any anybody ever said that you had some rheumatoid arthritis in your hand or wrist anything like that [Patient] no nobody say anything like that so i mean[SEP]","87":"[Conversation Start][SEP][Greetings][Doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 . hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ?

[Patient] no , i do n't .[SEP]","104":"[Discussion][Personal History][Medication][Reassessment][Doctor] hm , gotcha . okay . so let's talk about what you have going on . from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several-year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux . and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole , 40 milligrams twice daily . you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ? [Patient] yes .[SEP][Other Treatments][Reassessment][Doctor] and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated bev- beverages , citrus , and tomato-based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet . so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd , even though you're taking the ppi . [Patient] okay , yeah , i could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] great . so stress is another trigger that we need to address . high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms . [Patient] yeah , stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so working on that may help with your gerd . additionally , we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole . if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium . [Patient] that's fine with me . i'm definitely open to trying whatever .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] perfect . i will send a prescription for nexium 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file . i'll also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd , or upper endoscopy , to look for potential causes of the gerd . we'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth , down your throat , through your stomach , and end in the small intestines . we'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything . [Patient] okay . can i schedule that today ?[SEP]","105":"[Vegetative History][Doctor] okay . great . all right . so i know that you did a review of systems sheet with the nurse when you checked in . you know , i know that you were talking about some nasal congestion . do you have any other symptoms , chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , anything like that ?

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . so here in the office , you know , your blood pressure looks really good , as does your heart rate . so you are doing a good job managing your blood pressure . so i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . so on physical examination , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits in your neck . on your heart exam i do notice a slight 2\/6 systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past , so i think that's stable . your lungs in- are nice and clear , and you have some trace lower extremity edema bilaterally , so all that means is , you know , i agree , you know , maybe we should watch your diet a little bit better , okay ? but i wan na take a look at some of your results , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Radiology Examination][Reassessment][Doctor] all right . hey , dragon , show me the ekg . and the nurses did an ekg before you came in , and that looks perfectly fine , okay ? so i wan na just go ahead and talk a little about your assessment and my plan for you . so for your first problem , your depression , i think you're doing a really good job with your strategies . i do n't think ... it does n't sound to me like i need to start you on any medication at this time , unless you feel differently .

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that . [Patient] yeah , okay .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated .

Examination][Doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [Patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [Patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [Patient] that sounds great[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] alright do you have any other question [Patient] i do if anything happens in between[SEP]","277":"[Medication][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Reassessment][Doctor] now i did review the results of your echocardiogram which shows a preserved ef of fifty five percent abnormal diastolic filling and also mild to moderate mitral regurgitation so what all that means let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan so for your first problem of your you know congestive heart failure it sounds like this was caused by you know dietary indiscretion in an uncontrolled hypertension so what i wan na do is i want you to continue on bumex two milligrams one daily that's that water pill that you're talking about and then i want you to continue to watch your diet and also avoid salty foods i know you love your pizza and chicken wings but we are gon na have to cut back on those okay kevin [Patient] alright[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] alright now i want you to weigh yourself though everyday and then call me if you gain like three pounds in two days okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Referral][Doctor] okay now i do want you to see a nutritionist too and give you some education about what foods you can eat [Patient] alright sounds good[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] alright now for your second problem of hypertension i do want you to continue on that cozaar a hundred milligrams daily and then also continue on that norvasc five milligrams once daily and i'm gon na go ahead and order a renal artery ultrasound just to be sure that we are n't missing anything we wan na make sure there's no other causes like secondary causes that that's gon na cause some problems with your with your kidney okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] alright now for your third problem your kidney disease i do want to get some more labs some more blood work to make sure that you tolerate this regimen [Patient] alright that sounds good[SEP]","278":"[Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked [Patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days[SEP][Therapeutic History][Personal History][Doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing [Patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all [Patient] no just the swelling and the pain[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain [Patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and [Patient] putting a cold pack on it[SEP]","279":"[Acute Symptoms][Doctor] no it did n't help alright did you hear anything pop or anything like that when [Patient] i heard like an like a crack crackle so[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] you heard a crack [Patient] yeah[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay alright how long have you been mountain biking [Patient] for like three years[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] three years wow [Patient] or so[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] what where is your favorite place to go mountain biking [Patient] i do n't remember[SEP]","280":"[Physical Examination][Doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal [Patient] yes it hurts[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Radiology Examination][Referral][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me [Patient] when can i play basketball again[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball [Patient] i just played the wife with fun[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment [Patient] yeah they do[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay i you know i'm i'm just thinking you know i need to get some new shoes for some of it my activities i love the i

know and i can get you the hook up[SEP]","281":"[Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening [Patient] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Drug History][Doctor] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems [Patient] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having [Patient] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a

[Patient] uh , yes .[SEP][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off . [Patient] i see .[SEP][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ? [Patient] i think that sounds good to me .[SEP]","316":"[Other Socials][Doctor] wow that sounds kinda stressful like what are you moving for [Patient] well i'm stressed because what i'm moving because you know i i do n't like the west goes so i i decided to move but you know it's just stressful[SEP][Other Socials][Doctor] okay so are you thinking of driving [Patient] i i think so i think i'm i think i'm gon na end up driving but that's still a a long trip[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] yeah absolutely i can see how that would that would increase your stress but like with that have you lost any weight because of your symptoms [Patient] no i wish unfortunately i've gained some weight[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and do you have any other symptoms like abdominal pain nausea vomiting diarrhea [Patient] sometime my belly hurts up here[SEP]","317":"[Acute Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey joshua good to see you today so take a look at your chart here brenda and i see that you're coming in you you have i think you have a kidney stone so can you tell me what's going on how are you feeling and you're my my patient [Patient] and i'm your patient yeah[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay so is it is it a constant pain or does it come and go for you [Patient] it comes and goes it depends on how much i've been drinking and you know what sort of activities i've been doing but it's still there[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] alright so have you noticed any pain when you've been urinating [Patient] not really[SEP]","318":"[Conversation Start][SEP][Greetings][Doctor] hi , susan , how are you ?

[Patient] no other symptoms .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . all right . well , let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam . hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . so your vital signs here in the office look really good . you do n't have a fever . your blood pressure's nice and controlled . so that ... that's good . i'm just gon na check out your back and your heart and your lungs , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , so on physical examination , you know , your heart sounds great . there's ... it's a regular rate and rhythm . your lungs are nice and clear . on your back exam , you do have some pain to palpation of the right lumbar spine , uh , in the paraspinal muscles along with decreased flexion and extension of the back , and you have a positive straight leg on the right . or positive straight leg raise on the right , uh , but your strength is good bilaterally in your lower extremities . so that means that i think that you've injured your back . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] uh , but , you know , i think it's something that we can , we can fix , okay ? [Patient] okay , you do n't think there's anything wrong with the ... where i had the surgery before .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i do n't think so . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","320":"[Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] alright and alright no but no fevers with this so since you're here your oxygen level looks pretty good in the clinic it's about ninety four percent on pulse your pulse oxygenation so that's good are you short of breath so when you walk or you or you exert yourself you're short of breath you said right okay and have you and how how is your blood sugar been doing since this has been going on i know you're on metformin how's your diabetes been doing [Patient] not so good you know it kinda going up and down i wear this dexcom[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay and [Patient] and morning when i get up they are around one fifty[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay alright so it's been running a little bit high i know we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time and it was about seven . seven . i think and we had talked about you know improving your diet and improving some exercise but is this blood sugar been high and low or high and normal when you're especially in the last three weeks or has it been going on for longer than that [Patient] i would say about a month[SEP][Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay alright and how is your blood pressure been at home since you've been taking since these episodes that you've been sick are you taking norvasc [Patient] yes i am but i keep them on some days because my blood pressure has been running somewhat on the low side[SEP]","321":"[Physical Examination][Doctor] okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ? [Patient] ow , .[SEP][Discussion][Acute Assessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that . [Patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .[SEP][Discussion][Other Treatments][Doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you . [Patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Radiology Examination][Doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine . [Patient] so the good one is good ?[SEP]","322":"[Discussion][Doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started . [Patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] does that make sense ? [Patient] yes , it does .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study . [Patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?[SEP]","323":"[Physical Examination][Discussion][Reassessment][Doctor] okay . um , uh , hey , dragon ? show me the vital signs . okay , good news here is your blood pressure's good . everything , um , there is fine . so , um , so , my assessment is , is , um , your first problem is diabetes . it's a little out of control . we'd like that hemoglobin a1c to be under seven , um , at least . you know , preferably , under six . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] so , um , uh , i'm not gon na change your medication . i think this is diet related , so i want you to try to cut down on the snacking and additional sweets , okay ? [Patient] yeah .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] and , i want you to check your blood sugars in the morning . i want you to call them in in about two weeks so we know what your first , um , fasting blood sugar was in the morning , and then , we'll come back and see you in about two months and see if everything has straightened out . if it has n't , then we'll talk about adding another medication , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Reassessment][Doctor] your second problem is your hypertension . that seems to be relatively stable . i want you to stay on your current medication . you're on li- lisinopril 10 mg once a day . just stay right on that medication . no changes at this point . seems to be doing well , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] good . anything else i can do for you today ? [Patient] no . that's it .[SEP]","324":"[Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .

[Patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Reassessment][Diagnostic Testing][Medication][Doctor] hey , dragon ? show me the blood sugar . hey , dragon ? show me the blood glucose . hey , dragon ? show me the hemoglobin a1c . okay , so i see here that both your blood sugar and your hemoglobin a1c are elevated . so your blood sugars have probably been running high for probably a few months . okay ? um , let's go ahead and look at some of your other results . hey , dragon ? show me the diabetes labs . yeah . okay . yeah , so , um , my impression of you at this time , um , for your high blood sugars , that you do have this diagnosis of diabetes . now , we're not sure if it's type i or type ii . even patients in , you know , in their mid-twenties can develop type i diabetes , so we're gon na go off and , we're gon na go ahead and , and send some labs to work that up . hey , dragon ? order a complete metabolic panel . and i'd like to start you on metformin , 500 milligrams , twice a day . that will help keep your blood sugars down . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Medication][Doctor] hey , dragon ? order metformin , 500 milligrams , twice a day . and then if some of the autoimmune labs that come back show that you have an autoimmune disorder , meaning that you would have type i diabetes , then we would have to go ahead and put you on insulin . but i'm gon na hold off until we have those results , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Other Treatments][Doctor] but in the meantime , i really want you to avoid , uh , foods high in sugar . um , and the , the nurse will come in and she'll give you a glucometer and teach you how to do blood sugar testing . okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Reassessment][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] and then , from an atrial fibrillation standpoint , your heart , even though you're in atrial fibrillation right now , is in a good rate . and we'll just continue you on your metoprolol , 25 milligrams , twice a day . do you need a refill on that ? [Patient] yes , i do .[SEP]","326":"[Chitchat][Doctor] great . so here are my thoughts .

[Patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues . [Patient] mm-hmm .[SEP][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Referral][Doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ?

to sweep the nuts no one no one likes them[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Radiology Examination][Diagnostic Testing][Reassessment][Doctor] no one likes them okay well let's i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your blood pressure here in the office your blood pressure looks good it's about one twenty seven over sixty which is pretty good on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention there is no carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally and on your musculoskeletal exam your right radial artery cardiac cath site is clean dry and intact there is no hematoma and there is a palpable radial pulse now what does that mean betty so all of that means is that you know you have a little bit of a heart murmur after having the heart attack but i looked on the echocardiogram and it showed that you know you do have mild mitral regurgitation which is just you know a little floppy valve which is is fine we'll just keep an eye on that and then everything else for the most part looks good so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of your inferior myocardial myocardial infarction i wan na go ahead and continue with your aspirin continue on your brilinta you're gon na stay on the brilinta for at least one year and aspirin you're gon na take lifelong until i tell you to okay i wan na go ahead and have you continue on the crestor forty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and put in another echocardiogram for about six months okay do you have any questions about that [Patient] yeah do you think i can no that sounds good i have one other more question though[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Doctor] yeah so at this point you're you know you're out like two weeks and your and your cath site is looks good so you can go ahead and and resume swimming now with that being said i would want you to just do a few laps here and there i do want to enroll you into cardiac rehab that's gon na give you a bit more confidence to go back to exercising and they also give a lot of dietary education and counseling in cardiac rehab does that sounds like something that you can do [Patient] yeah i think i have to[SEP][Follow-up][Medication][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay i agree alright i also want you to go ahead and continue with your toprol fifty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and order a some liver function studies and a lipid panel to follow up with the next time we meet and i want to see you again in probably six weeks okay [Patient] okay[SEP]","355":"[Personal History][Doctor] okay your blood sugars are running below [Patient] it's it's probably with with with the metformin it seems to be you know one twenty[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] good your blood sugars are running in the one twenties that's really good okay alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good i do think you're doing a good job with taking your lisinopril your blood pressure's about one twenty two over seventy right now which is right where we want it your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty seven again which is right where we want it and i do n't appreciate any fever today you you have a normal temperature at ninety eight . four which is really good so i'm just gon na be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally on your right knee exam i do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance over your right patella now does it hurt when i press [Patient] it's a little bit sore[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all [Patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Medication][Doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so do you have any questions about that [Patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just[SEP]","356":"[Discussion][Doctor] most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first . for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve [Patient] okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this [Patient] sure[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Medication][Doctor] it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you [Patient] okay sounds good let's do it[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain [Patient] yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not[SEP][Follow-up][Doctor] i think one month would be a great time to follow up [Patient] okay sounds good so if you want to send that prescription over to my pharmacy that would be fine and then why do n't i come back in about a month and we'll go from there[SEP]","357":"[Personal History][Doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ? [Patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on . [Patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high . [Patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] typically , it does n't . [Patient] okay .[SEP]","358":"[Personal History][Doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [Patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [Patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [Patient] yeah[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [Patient] probably about a month ago[SEP]","359":"[Personal History][Doctor] okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go [Patient] well when i you know after i found out i had a disk a kidney stone it came a couple times but it did n't last as long no i've been i've been straining my urine they told me to pee in this little cup[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] mm-hmm [Patient] and i've been straining my urine and you know i do n't see anything in there[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] okay have you noticed any blood in your urine i know you've been draining probably take a good look at it has it been darker than usual [Patient] no not really not really darker[SEP][Family History][Doctor] okay so have you had kidney stones before and then you said your father had them but [Patient] i've never had a kidney stone my dad had them a lot but i've never had one[SEP]","360":"[Personal History][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . all right . and then , your depression , you said it's ... how's that going ? i know we have you on the , on the prozac 20mg a day . are you taking that ? are you having a lot of side effects from that ? [Patient] i was taking it regularly , but i've kind of weened myself off of it . i thought i felt a little bit better , but i think , uh , i , i kinda go through battles with depression every so often .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . all right . are you interested in resuming the medication , or would you like to try a different one ? [Patient] i , maybe adjusting what i'm currently taking , maybe l- less of a dose so i do n't feel the side effects as much , but i , i'm willing to try something different .[SEP][Physical Examination][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . all right . okay , well , let's , let's go ahead and we'll do a quick physical exam . so , looking at you , you're in , in no apparent distress . i'm feeling your neck . there's no cervical lymphadenopathy . your thyroid seems not enlarged . and , listening to your lungs , you do have some bilateral expiratory wheezing that's very faint , and your heart is a regular rate and rhythm . your abdomen is soft , and uh , your lower extremities have no edema . so , let's go ahead and look at some of your results . hey , dragon , show me the pfts . okay , so your , your pfts , that , those are your breathing studies , and those look quite good , so i know that you're wheezing right now , but , um , you know , i think that we can add , add , um , a regimen to that to help , to help you with your , um , exacerbations during the , the summer months , okay ? [Patient] okay .[SEP][Medication][Lab Examination][Doctor] and then , let's look at your ... hey , dragon ? show me the hemoglobin a1c . okay , so your a1c , you're right , you know , over the past couple months is , you know , your blood sugar's probably been running a little high , so , you know , i know that you're gon na get back on your diet regimen , but , um , for right now , let's go ahead and we'll increase your metformin , okay ?

Assessment][Other Treatments][Doctor] same thing okay so you do have a bilateral positive tinel's sign so so here's here's where i'm at i think your your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping the heavy labor and you you know your your clinical exam and and history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome i do want to order so where are we gon na go from here i would like to order a a study it's called an emg where it it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers we will follow up with that but as far as your treatment so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification now i know you are a landscaper is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time [Patient] i suppose i could try to pass it off to some of my other employes and delegate[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Follow-up][Other Treatments][Medication][Doctor] okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you [Patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do [Patient] mostly like yard work and maintenance flower beds not really designing just up keep[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] okay yeah i'm looking for a landscape designer i need somebody to put in some elaborate walkways back through the backyard so yeah we can do stuff like that i mean

there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of [Patient] oof[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions [Patient] no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery[SEP]","367":"[Chitchat][Doctor] yeah i know i i i will say i think jason tatum and jaylen brown paid played phenomenally so i do think that they help with the cell fix over the edge so but that's all we'll talk about that what's that [Patient] i said yeah too bad they did[SEP][Physical Examination][Medication][Other Treatments][Acute Assessment][Doctor] yeah alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you okay so you know looking at

calling out my physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so on your neck exam i appreciate some jugular venous distention up to about nine centimeters there are no carotid bruits on your lung exam i do appreciate bibasilar crackles with occasional rhonchi that clears when you cough on your heart exam i do appreciate a three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate one to two plus pitting edema bilaterally so frank what does that mean all that means is that you have findings on you that suggest that you're retaining fluid now we'll have to talk a little bit about how we're going to address that okay so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you okay so for the for your first problem of your shortness of breath i do believe you're having a an acute heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and increase your lasix from forty milligrams a

[Patient] yeah , that sounds good .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today . [Patient Guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense .

[Patient] uh , mainly just sore . sometimes they throb , but overall , they feel weaker too , especially when i'm using them . the tingling happens some more , but when they hurt , you know , it goes away and then the tingling's just dull .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] what kind of activities ? [Patient] well , really , i guess , just more so at night , and then it just kind of comes and goes throughout the day .[SEP][Acute Symptoms][Doctor] okay . and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ? [Patient] uh , like , like feeling something ? no , not that i can think of really . in general , they might be less sensitive than they should be , but i can still feel . they gave me some nerve pain medicine , but i have n't been taking it like i should be .[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] okay . looks like your medical history is notable for chronic kidney disease , gout , hypertension , anxiety , gerd , and diabetes . [Patient] well , i had pre-diabetes , but i got in under control changing my diet .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Drug History][Doctor] okay . good . and are you still on the carvedilol 25 milligrams two times a day for hypertension and lexapro 10 milligrams a day for anxiety ? looks like your allergic to sulfa drugs as well . is that correct ? [Patient] yeah , i'm still taking those and sulfa just causes me to break out in a rash .[SEP]","374":"[Conversation Start][SEP]","375":"[Discussion][Medication][Doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin . [Patient] all right .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad . [Patient] okay . got it .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ? [Patient] okay , thank you for explaining .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] so i will say , \" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . \" [Patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash. [Patient] okay .[SEP]","376":"[Discussion][Medication][Doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . [Patient] okay . i did n't realize that .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? [Patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ? [Patient] twice a day .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ? [Patient] no , that's fine .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?

[Patient] okay .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream . [Patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .

musculoskeletal low back strain i'm going to order a low back x-ray so we'll order that and get that done as an outpatient i do n't expect to see anything significant but it's gon na tell me how those joint spaces look and if you know if we're dealing with any disk issue but that will be the start of it and i'm also gon na order some physical therapy two for two reasons to help with a little bit with the pain but also strengthen some of the muscles there in the back so those are the two things that we are gon na do now i want you to take take four hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that occasionally with some tylenol when the pain gets more severe up to about three times a day i'm gon na also give you a prescription for some flexeril that's a muscle relaxant and i want you to take one of those once a day every evening but be careful if you're doing any strenuous or hazardous activities such as driving after you take those now for your diabetes my impression is that your diabetes is is under control i noticed that we do n't have n't had a a1c for almost five months so i'm also gon na order an a1c so we can find out where we are with that continue with your diet and exercise we know that's really important and then continue with your metformin i'm not gon na make any changes today but we'll go ahead and look at that once i get that results of that a1c do you have

[Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Other Treatments][Doctor] so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision . [Patient] okay , that is fine with me , i ca n't see back there anyways .[SEP][Discussion][Follow-up][Doctor] yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it , as it heals . um , but since we're , we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems . however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly so she can monitor you . uh , your dermatologist will check that this one does n't come back , but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious . uh , unfortunately , since you've had one melanoma , you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else . [Patient] yeah , she did say she wants to see me back .[SEP][Medication][Doctor] good , and i'm sure she's already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight .

[Patient] lovely .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Medication][Doctor] we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better . [Patient] all right .[SEP]","520":"[Physical Examination][Doctor] all right , we're going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination . let's look at the right hand first . can you feel this ?

[Patient] yeah , same on that side too .[SEP][Physical Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] tinel sign positive at both wrists and both elbows . rest of exam is normal . all right , so what i am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or , potentially , this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome . however , your symptom presentation suggests car- bilateral carpal syndrome , as the nerve in your wrists are aggravated by your past trauma . this is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me .

of weeks you know your ankle sprain seems to be not the worst but it's kinda you know medium grade ankle sprain so as i would say about two to three weeks you should be back to normal you will see some of that bruising go away [Patient] yeah okay can i get a doctor's note[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] no because you need to go back to work because you work on the computer not running so [Patient]

[Patient] yeah , there were a couple days there i took an extra one , just because there was a little extra pain in my feet . and i do have a desk job , so when i have a day off where i'm moving around a lot they do tend to hurt a bit more .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . how many times did you do that ? [Patient] um , it was n't often , maybe once a week .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . so it sounds like we're still on track for discontinuing the prednisone . we'll do that today and you can let me know how it goes on your next visit . and how about the methotrexate , do you think that helped with your joint pain ? [Patient] yeah , definitely . because i went to get my covid shots , um , but from the letter i got about it , it said that it could interfere with the vaccine , you know , reduce the efficacy . so i did n't take it on the week that i got the first shot .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay . and what happened ? [Patient] i felt absolutely horrible until i took it again a week later .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] i'm sorry to hear that . and- and what did you do about the second dose ?

[Patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Reassessment][Doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well . [Patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 . [Patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .[SEP]","571":"[Personal History][Doctor] okay . all right . and how are you doing with your reflux ?

[Patient] yes .[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] so that's , you're doing well with that ? [Patient] yep .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . all right . so let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam . so , listening to you , um , look , or looking at you , you appear in no distress . your thyroid is a little enlarged , but non-tender . there's no carotid bruits , your heart is in irregular rate and rhythm , and your lungs are clear . your abdomen is nice and soft , and you have no edema in your lower extremities . let's go ahead and look at some of your test results . [Patient] okay .[SEP][Reassessment][Diagnostic Testing][Medication][Doctor] hey , dragon ? show me the blood sugar . hey , dragon ? show me the blood glucose . hey , dragon ? show me the hemoglobin a1c . okay , so i see here that both your blood sugar and your hemoglobin a1c are elevated . so your blood sugars have probably been running high for probably a few months . okay ? um , let's go ahead and look at some of your other results . hey , dragon ? show me the diabetes labs . yeah . okay . yeah , so , um , my impression of you at this time , um , for your high blood sugars , that you do have this diagnosis of diabetes . now , we're not sure if it's type i or type ii . even patients in , you know , in their mid-twenties can develop type i diabetes , so we're gon na go off and , we're gon na go ahead and , and send some labs to work that up . hey , dragon ? order a complete metabolic panel . and i'd like to start you on metformin , 500 milligrams , twice a day . that will help keep your blood sugars down .

[Patient] yes .[SEP]","573":"[Vegetative History][Doctor] okay sometimes alright that's fine i i just i'm not seeing one here today so that's okay alright so with that being said i do wan na ask have you been experiencing any fatigue are you tired [Patient] well since the accident yes[SEP][Radiology Examination][Doctor] okay alright just making sure okay so this is what this is my assessment and plan this is what we are gon na do i want to be able to like we had you do an x-ray before you came in here and looking at it i'm not noticing any fracture that's a really good sign considering how many car accidents we've been in lately [Patient] it hurts it hurts[SEP][Radiology Examination][Acute Assessment][Doctor] absolutely no i we're gon na address the pain so for my first so looking at your imaging results though i'm not seeing a fracture that's a great sign so for your first diagnosis i'm gon na say that you have what is called a neck sprain that [Patient] thinking are are you saying i'm thinking[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] no not by any means i am saying [Patient] pain i have a lot of pain[SEP][Acute Assessment][Doctor] yes and your pain can be explained by multiple things but thankfully it's not a broken neck is that okay [Patient] yes[SEP]","574":"[Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today . [Patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ? [Patient] yeah , i have both .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like . [Patient] okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Discussion][Diagnostic Testing][Referral][Other Treatments][Doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield . [Patient] okay , that sounds good .[SEP]","575":"[Personal History][Doctor] okay and that's when you get the pain more [Patient] maybe located in the center but it goes across to the little back and i on the left side[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] i also heard you say you know if you twist suddenly that makes it worse is that correct [Patient] it makes it worse it makes it worse i mean yeah[SEP][Personal History][Doctor] now you know i was looking at your records and i know you have that history of diabetes and i have n't seen you a while for a follow-up for that how you've been feeling [Patient] i mean been okay i mean i take my meds[SEP][Therapeutic History][Doctor] okay so you're on [Patient] mm-hmm[SEP]","576":"[Physical Examination][Doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants . [Patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working . [Patient] okay , good .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain . [Patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ? [Patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .[SEP][Lab Examination][Doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ? [Patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .[SEP]","577":"[Physical Examination][Doctor] yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel [Patient] just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end[SEP][Physical Examination][Discussion][Medication][Other Treatments][Diagnostic Testing][Acute Assessment][Doctor] okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam fifty milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan [Patient] it it does now well i need to limit my work activities i i typically sit behind a desk but it's not been very comfortable sitting here lately[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Doctor] yeah definitely so yeah so you you can limit the activities for sure in terms of your work activities i know if you sit too long sometimes it can be painful because you do need to move that leg a little bit so it does n't lock up so i i would like for you to you know do do some slight activities not enough to stress your legs but definitely move move them a little bit every now and then so it does n't lock up on you okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] alright i do want you to i know you are i know you actually jog often so i want you to just slow that down for a bit no jogging for a while until we get you know results of your mri till we figure out what we what we are gon na be doing okay [Patient] okay[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] alright and how's your dog you has it been jogging with you before this incident [Patient] how's just how's my dog or how is my job[SEP]","578":"[Conversation Start][SEP][Personal History][Greetings][Doctor] hey mason good to see you today so let's see you here in my

Symptoms][Greetings][Doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that [Patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it[SEP]","599":"[Vegetative History][Doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs [Patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well[SEP][Chitchat][Doctor] that's okay [Patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day[SEP][Vegetative History][Doctor] absolutely [Patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now

out of five for abduction of legs bilaterally and the remainder of muscle strength for your lower extremities are five out of five so that's good let me take a look at your knee now on your knee exam there is no overlying erythema that's redness or ecchymosis and that's bruising or any warmth of the skin appreciated there is no effusion let me go ahead and feel around here does that hurt right here how does that feel [Patient] it does[SEP][Physical Examination][Doctor] sorry so there is tenderness to palpation of the bilateral retinacular retinaculum and there is positive patellar grind

definitely having some knee pain with squatting and i'm just gon na maneuver your leg just a little bit here real quick okay so lachman anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray tests are all negative bilaterally so that's good there okay now your neuro exam patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical alright so now i did review the results of your x-ray and both of your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan so for your problem of bilateral knee pain based on what you told me your exam and reviewing your mri your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a very common condition that we see that causes knee pain especially in active young people so this condition has to do with the way your kneecap which is your patella how that moves along the groove of your thigh your thigh bone which is the femur now for the pain you may continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatory as needed to help with the pain but i'm also going to recommend physical therapy where where they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you may have so do you have any questions for me about that [Patient] will i be able to run anytime soon[SEP][Discussion][Doctor] well that is a goal of treatment and to get you back in running again now you will have to take an take it easy from running for now but we will continue to assess your

Assessment][Doctor] well that's good so let's go ahead and do a physical exam on you real quick here okay and so i'm looking at your vital signs it looks like your blood pressure i we mentioned that today is pretty high your heart rate looks good it's with it's within normal limits here and then your oxygenation is fine so you did mention you did n't have any shortness of breath so that's good so let me just feel around your neck real quick here i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention on your neck exam i no carotid bruits so that's good let me go ahead and listen to your lungs and your heart here real quick alright so on your auscultation of your lungs they're clear bilaterally on your heart exam though i i do sense a two out of six systolic ejection murmur now that was also there last year so it has n't changed any so we'll just keep monitoring that one and then let me take a look at your extremities here real quick theresa so let me look at your hands you got a little bit of slight edema bilaterally on your upper extremities but let me look at your legs here okay so you have a one plus pitting edema noted here on your legs bilaterally so that means you're retaining a lot of that salt that you're eating unfortunately okay so so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan here so definitely what you're experiencing is some uncontrolled hypertension now most of the time you know it's multifactorial right it's your diet it could be the medication regimen if you're not following that and then it might be that we are gon na need to change the medication around and also change your diet but i would like to start with going ahead and i want to continue your current medication regimen today i do wan na really encourage that you do take that everyday maybe set a reminder like on your you know do you use your iphone a lot for your reminders and things maybe we can go ahead and do that get a reminder make sure that you take that everyday but with that i would like to go ahead and also monitor your blood pressure let's do it three times a week it can be much when we do it everyday but maybe three times a week do you have a blood pressure monitor at home [Patient] no[SEP][Discussion][Referral][Medication][Other Treatments][Doctor] okay so i can recommend some really good ones nowadays that you can use at home and they're not that expensive and at least it'll give you some you know idea of what your blood pressure is running at and then i want you to come back like in a month because i wan na go ahead and see how your blood pressure is doing now that you know you're you you're taking your blood pressure medication everyday the other thing is i do wan na go ahead and have a nutritionist come and talk to you about you may maybe some dietary changes i'd like for you to start a \u2013 diet it's really to to help you know a lot of reduce a lot of that sodium intake when you're when you're when you're taking in your food so a nutritionist is gon na be able to help you figure out some foods that you know that you may like that you can actually use as an alternative besides the mcdonald's although you can have that once in a blue moon but you know not not too often okay [Patient] okay sounds good[SEP][Discussion][Medication][Reassessment][Doctor] great and then for your diabetes i wan na go ahead and let's go ahead and increase your your metformin to fifteen hundred milligrams i think all for that too i want you to go ahead and continue taking your blood sugars to make sure as as you normally would to
