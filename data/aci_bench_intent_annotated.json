that means that you have some findings on your belly exam that concern me about your gall bladder , okay ? so , we'll have to look into that and then , um , your right knee looks a little swollen , but you know , we know you have some arthritis there , okay ?

i know that you've had this chronic back pain that we've been dealing with . how's that , how's that going ? patient: uh , i've been managing it . it's still , um , here nor there . just , just keeps , um , it really bothers me when i sit for long periods of time at , at my desk at work . so i have ... it helps when i get up and move , but it gets really stiff and it hurts when i sit down for long periods of time .","198":"doctor: okay , and do you get any numbing or tingling down your legs or any pain down leg versus the other ?

patient: yeah . no problem in , uh , rehab and recovery .","304":"doctor: okay . and no chest pain while you were , you know , doing exercises in pt for your knee ? patient: no . that's why last week's episode was so surprising .","305":"doctor: okay . all right . and in terms of your high blood pressure , do you know when you had the chest pain if your blood pressure was very high ? did they say anything in the emergency room ? patient: um , they were a little concerned about it , but , uh , they kept me there for a few hours and it seemed to regulate after effect . so , it , it did n't seem to be a problem when i , when i went home .","306":"doctor: okay . and , and i see here that it was about 180 over 95 when you went into the emergency room . has it been running that high ?

the top off the snow cone . um , so i'll be gentle but i want to examine your arm . patient: all right .","472":"doctor: all right . are you able to straighten your arm ? patient: yeah , i can just straighten the elbow as long as i do n't move up here .","473":"doctor: as long as you do n't move your shoulder . patient: yeah .","474":"doctor: go ahead and bend . okay . so your exam is generally normal , meaning that the rest of your body is normal patient: okay.","475":"doctor: but you've got some swelling and erythema- patient: yeah .","476":"doctor: . on that right shoulder . you've got uh , tenderness over your right shoulder . you've got normal pulses , and everything else is normal . any numbness or tingling in that right arm ? patient: no .","477":"doctor: okay . um , so what we're going to have to do- the good thing about um , these kinds of fractures is generally , they will heal up without surgery . um , but we have to put you in a sling that weighs your arm down and pulls it down . so we're going to put you in a long arm cast and a sling , and then we're gon na check you in two weeks to see if those bones have realigned and if they have n't , then we're gon na have to talk about doing surgery at that time . patient: okay .","478":"doctor: i'm going to prescribe you some pain medicine . we'll do lortab 500- lortab 5 milligram . um , you can take one to two tablets every uh , six hours as needed for pain . i'll give you 20 of those . patient: all right .","479":"doctor: and um , do you have any allergies to medicines ?

patient: this was just yesterday .","488":"doctor: all right . and have you tried anything for it ? i mean ... patient: i put ice on it . and i've been taking ibuprofen , but it still hurts at lot .","489":"doctor: okay , what makes it better or worse ? patient: the ice , when i have it on , is better .","490":"doctor: all right . uh , let's review your past medical history . uh ... looks like you've got a history of anaphylaxis , is that correct ? patient: yes . yes , i do . yeah .","491":"doctor: do you take any medications for it ? patient: um , ep- ... just an epipen .","492":"doctor: just epipen for anaphylaxis when you need it . um , and what surgeries have you had before ? patient: yeah , so carotid . yeah-","493":"doctor: . yeah , no , uh , your , uh , neck surgery .all right . well let's , uh , examine you here for a second .so it's your , uh , this elbow right here ? patient: yeah .","494":"doctor: and is it hurt- ... tender right around that area ? patient: yes , it is .","495":"doctor: okay . can you flex it or can you bend it ? patient: it hurts when i do that , yeah .","496":"doctor: all right . and go ahead and straighten out as much as you can . patient: that's about it .","497":"doctor: all right . patient: yeah .","498":"doctor: so there's some swelling there . and how about , uh , can you move your fingers okay ? does that hurt ? patient: no , that's fine .","499":"doctor: how about right over here ? patient: uh , no that's fine . yeah .","500":"doctor: okay . so on exam you've got some tenderness over your lateral epicondyle . uh , you have some swelling there and some redness . uh , you have some pain with flexion , extension of your elbow as well . uh , and you have some pain on the dorsal aspect of your- of your forearm as well . okay ? so let's look at your x-rays . hey dragon , show me the x-rays . all right . your x-ray of your elbow-it looks like , i mean , the bones are lined up properly . there's no fracture- . it , uh , there's a little bit of swelling there on the lateral elbow but i do n't see any fracture , so that's good . so , looking at the x-ray and looking at your exam , uh , my diagnosis here would be lateral epicondylitis , and this is basically inflammation of this area where this tendon in- inserts . and probably that happened when you were moving those boxes . so we'll try some motrin , uh , about 800 milligrams every six hours . uh , i'll give you a sling for comfort , just so you can use it if- if it's causing a lot of pain . patient: hmm .","501":"doctor: and it should get better , uh , in about , you know , in a couple of days it should be improved . and if it does n't get better , give us a call and we'll see you some time next week . okay ? so we'll give you a sling , we'll give you the motrin , i'll give you about , uh , 30 , uh , uh , 30 , uh , uh , medications for that . uh , do you have any questions ? patient: no , no . thank you .","502":"doctor: hey dragon , order the medications and the procedures . all right , why do n't you come with me and we'll get you signed out ? patient: okay , sounds good .","503":"doctor: hey dragon , finalize the report .","504":"doctor: hi , vincent . how are you ? patient: i'm good . how about you ?","505":"doctor: i'm good . so le- are you ready to get started ? patient: i am .","506":"doctor: okay . vincent is a 56-year-old male here with abnormal lab findings . so , i've heard you were in the er , vincent , and they found that you had a low hemoglobin . patient: yup .","507":"doctor: were you having some dizziness and some lightheadedness ? patient: i was very lightheaded . i- i do n't know . very lightheaded .","508":"doctor: okay . and have you noticed bleeding from anywhere ? patient: i have not . i have n't hurt myself in quite a while . maybe a slight nick from a knife while chopping some onions , but nothing more than that .","509":"doctor: but no blood in your stools or- patient: no .","510":"doctor: . anything like that ? patient: no .","511":"doctor: okay . and any type of weight loss or decreased appetite or night sweats ? coughs ? patient: uh , s- slightly decreased appetite , but i wish i had some weight loss .","512":"doctor: um , okay . and how about any abdominal pain ? fever , chills ? patient: uh , none of that .","513":"doctor: okay . all right . um , any nausea or vomiting ? patient: not really . yeah . maybe a bit of nausea .","514":"doctor: okay . all right . um , well , how are you doing in terms of your knee replacement . i know you had that done last year . that's going okay ? patient: mm , it seems okay . yeah .","515":"doctor: okay . you're walking around without a problem ? patient: yup , yup . just not good enough to run yet , but everything else works just fine .","516":"doctor: all right .um , and i know a few years ago , you had , had that scare with the possible lung cancer , but then they did the biopsy and , and you've been fine . patient: yup , yup . all good .","517":"doctor: turned out to be benign . patient: yup .","518":"doctor: okay . great . all right . well , let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam . so looking at you , you do n't appear in any distress . your heart is regular . your lungs sound nice and clear . you have some tenderness to the right lower quadrant to palpation of your abdomen . your lower extremities have no edema . um , all right . well , let's go ahead and look at your labs , okay ? patient: yup .","519":"doctor: hey , dragon , show me the hemoglobin . yeah , so your hemoglobin is 8.2 , which is quite low for somebody of your height and weight , so we'll have to look into that a , a little bit further . i know that they did the endoscopy in the emergency room . hey , dragon , show me the endoscope results . good . so it looks like you had some gastritis , which is just inflammation of your stomach and they also found a slight polyp , which i know that they biopsied and the results are pending at this time . um , so , you may have had some bleeding from the gastritis . it's not usual for people to have bleeding from that . um , okay , well , hey , dragon , show me the anemia panel . okay . anyway , okay . well , vincent , i think , you know , in terms of , my impression of you is that you've had this newfound anemia and for that , i think that we should go ahead and put you on protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day to help with the gastritis . does that sound okay to you ? patient: it does . you're the doctor . i do n't know what it is .","520":"doctor: so that's just , uh , what we call a proton pump inhibitor which , uh , helps decrease the amount of acid secreted within your stomach . patient: got it . makes sense .","521":"doctor: hey , hey , dragon , order protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day . and i'd like you to try to cut down on your caffeine 'cause that can also irritate your stomach . try not to take any ibuprofen and try to cut down on any alcohol intake , okay ? patient: yup , yup . the coffee's the hard part .","522":"doctor: yeah . it always is . how about one , one , one eight-ounce cup a day ? okay ? patient: sure .","523":"doctor: um , and we'll go ahead and we'll see you in a couple weeks , okay ? patient: sure thing .","524":"doctor: i'm going through , uh , i'll also order another , uh , cbc on you . hey , dragon , order a complete blood count . all right . the nurse will be in soon . it's , you know , settle all that . i'll see you soon . patient: see you .","525":"doctor: hey , dragon , finalize the note .","526":"doctor: next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 . hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ? patient: i'm good , thanks . how are you ?","527":"doctor: i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . patient: yes , i did .","528":"doctor: anything new since your last visit ? patient: no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .","529":"doctor: okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ? patient: i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .","530":"doctor: okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 . patient: okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?","531":"doctor: yep , right here . patient: wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .","532":"doctor: yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself . patient: that would be great .","533":"doctor: so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days . patient: okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .","534":"doctor: maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well . patient: okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?","535":"doctor: maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range . patient: okay .","536":"doctor: i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . patient: you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .","537":"doctor: have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? patient: i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .","538":"doctor: okay , good . patient: and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?","539":"doctor: um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ? patient: i'm not sure what it is , either .","540":"doctor: okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ... patient: okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .","541":"doctor: so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . patient: okay .","542":"doctor: chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . patient: it wo n't , okay , thank you .","543":"doctor: it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you . patient: okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .","544":"doctor: yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated . patient: okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .","545":"doctor: yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . patient: okay , thank you . got it .","546":"doctor: all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ? patient: no , not that i know of .","547":"doctor: okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ? patient: yes .","548":"doctor: all right . patient: um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .","549":"doctor: and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ? patient: no , i've never tried anything for it .","550":"doctor: okay . we might give you some of that . patient: okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .","551":"doctor: okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ? patient: yes , i also do have that problem .","552":"doctor: all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that . patient: okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .","553":"doctor: great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart . patient: okay .","554":"doctor: all right , deep breath . all right , again . patient: okay .","555":"doctor: all right , sounds good . patient: great .","556":"doctor: let me take a look at your feet and ankles . patient: okay .","557":"doctor: all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . patient: okay , i will do that .","558":"doctor: now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future . patient: okay , that's okay .","559":"doctor: all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not . patient: yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .","560":"doctor: okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range . patient: okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .","561":"doctor: okay , great . let's see them . patient: okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .","562":"doctor: yeah , your alt was about 128 . patient: okay , and , and back in october was 254 .","563":"doctor: yeah , this is much better . patient: okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .","564":"doctor: okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . patient: okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?","565":"doctor: um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . patient: okay .","566":"doctor: this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . patient: okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .","567":"doctor: yeah , that sounds like a plan . patient: okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?","568":"doctor: so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started . patient: okay , and what's involved with that ?","569":"doctor: so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . patient: okay .","570":"doctor: so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . patient: okay .","571":"doctor: does that make sense ? patient: yes , it does .","572":"doctor: so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study . patient: okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?","573":"doctor: um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you . patient: i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .","574":"doctor: if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify . patient: okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .","575":"doctor: correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that . patient: okay .","576":"doctor: but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up . patient: and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .","577":"doctor: of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ?

patient: um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .","593":"doctor: okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ? patient: yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .","594":"doctor: mm-hmm . patient: and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .","595":"doctor: yeah , i see that . patient: so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand .","596":"doctor: what do you do for a living ? patient: uh , i'm an x-ray tech .","597":"doctor: well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ? patient: nope .","598":"doctor: uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ?

patient: yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .","601":"doctor: all right , how about here ? patient: um , there , it's not .","602":"doctor: okay , not as bad ? patient: yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .","603":"doctor: gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can . patient: my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there .","604":"doctor: okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ? patient: ow , .","605":"doctor: okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that . patient: well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .","606":"doctor: well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you . patient: okay . i thought it would straighten it out .","607":"doctor: no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two . patient: okay .","608":"doctor: uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine . patient: so the good one is good ?","609":"doctor: yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good . patient: okay , good .","610":"doctor: yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley . patient: okay , all right .","611":"doctor: so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone . patient: i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy .","612":"doctor: did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger . patient: all right , we'll give it a try .","613":"doctor: good . so , you do the shot , and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better . and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better . patient: perfect .","614":"doctor: all right , so take advantage of that . you've got ta start moving the finger . you're not going to tear anything or break a bone , uh , because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you've got a stiff , sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part , and then you have to do all the stiff part . patient: the lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out , but it even hurt after i left . the whole thing just swelled up .","615":"doctor: hmm . okay , so it was injured , and you had scar tissue . and then , you had post-traumatic inflammation . and so , this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like , , my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable , to where you can make some gains . and we actually might need to repeat this as well . patient: will i be able to drive ? i drove myself here today , so ...","616":"doctor: yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive . patient: okay , good .","617":"doctor: so for mr . gutierrez , just put that he has a post-traumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of his right index finger , and the plan is steroid injection today , do a trigger injection , but i'm using a cc of betamethasone . so , mr . gutierrez , do you have , um , therapy scheduled or set up ? patient: uh , not at the moment .","618":"doctor: all right , well , i mean , you know that you need to move that finger , and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so i want you to move that finger , finger , but i think it would be , uh , beneficial for you to have an accountability , um , so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody . patient: um , okay . that's kinda why i'm here , for you to tell me what needs to be done , you know ?","619":"doctor: yeah , so i'll write you out , um , an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks , um , and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions . patient: all right , sounds like a plan .","620":"doctor: all right , well , i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure , and we'll , and i'll be back shortly . patient: thanks , doc .","621":"doctor: right trigger finger injection template . attempted to inject one cc of celestone with f- , a half a cc of lidocaine . however , the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle , with contortions of the hand , and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick . needle was withdrawn . the patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath . we attempted a second time for a similar injection using the same technique with one cc of celestone and half a cc of lidocaine . a small parma- , uh , palmar vein bled a scant amount , which was cleaned up and band-aid applied . reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger . recommended icing in it this evening , and taking ibuprofen .","622":"doctor: next patient is paul edwards , date of birth is january 15th 1962 . so he's a 59 year old hiv positive gentleman here for hypogonadism . patient was last seen on november 24th 2020 . his notable things are number one , he is on 1 milliliter every 10 days , uh , his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he's on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily so he takes all his pills just from me . um , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia which is ... which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500 . hey , how are you today ?

it's the only change .","637":"doctor: i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve . patient: yeah .","638":"doctor: but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it . patient: i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .","639":"doctor: yeah , that's an unbelievable difference . patient: 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .","640":"doctor: absolutely . patient: my red blood cell count has increased .","641":"doctor: yeah , i saw that . it's fine though . patient: stable .","642":"doctor: your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think . patient: yeah . , is it ?","643":"doctor: yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good . patient: nice , that's good news .","644":"doctor: so it just needs to be checked every year or so . patient: so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?","645":"doctor: yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so . patient: okay .","646":"doctor: i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me . patient: okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .","647":"doctor: well , your levels are high . patient: are they right now ?","648":"doctor: well , i mean they were last time . patient: yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .","649":"doctor: i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ? patient: i figure i'm on my eighth day today .","650":"doctor: all right . patient: i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .","651":"doctor: that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on . patient: okay .","652":"doctor: you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well . patient: yeah , i'm feeling good .","653":"doctor: i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ?

does that show up ?","700":"doctor: um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march . patient: all righty .","701":"doctor: so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today . patient: all righty that sounds good .","702":"doctor: i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good . patient: okay great . that all sounds awesome .","703":"doctor: all right let's take a quick listen . use my general physical exam template . and take a couple of deep breaths for me . your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things . patient: all righty .","704":"doctor: so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine . patient: yeah , that'll be okay .","705":"doctor: great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand . patient: yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me .","706":"doctor: perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june . patient: okay , i'll put that down .","707":"doctor: you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today . patient: yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .","708":"doctor: lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ? patient: yeah , i have both .","709":"doctor: okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like . patient: okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?","710":"doctor: um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery . patient: okay , good .","711":"doctor: so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield . patient: okay , that sounds good .","712":"doctor: i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon . patient: okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great .","713":"doctor: so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go . patient: great , thank you .","714":"doctor: you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ? patient: sounds good .","715":"doctor: all right , assessment and plan . chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate . uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer . uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .","716":"doctor: dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03\/04\/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ? patient: good morning .","717":"doctor: it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller . patient: it's nice to meet you as well .","718":"doctor: so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ? patient: that's correct .","719":"doctor: okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ? patient: well , right now the hand is .","720":"doctor: mm-hmm . patient: and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .","721":"doctor: okay , that's good . patient: so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .","722":"doctor: okay , i see . patient: and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .","723":"doctor: mm-hmm , okay . patient: um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .","724":"doctor: okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though . patient: um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .","725":"doctor: probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ? patient: uh , no .","726":"doctor: okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ? patient: no .","727":"doctor: and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ? patient: um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .","728":"doctor: okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ? patient: well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .","729":"doctor: okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ? patient: uh , yes .","730":"doctor: okay . like , in terms of gripping things ? patient: yeah .","731":"doctor: really ? patient: yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .","732":"doctor: gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ? patient: uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .","733":"doctor: okay . is it neuropathy ? patient: uh , yep .","734":"doctor: gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look . patient: okay .","735":"doctor: all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ? patient: no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .","736":"doctor: okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ? patient: yeah , just a little strain .","737":"doctor: okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this . patient: okay .","738":"doctor: and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ? patient: uh , yes .","739":"doctor: okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off . patient: i see .","740":"doctor: so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ? patient: i think that sounds good to me .","741":"doctor: okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list . patient: uh , no , i do n't .","742":"doctor: okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ? patient: um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .","743":"doctor: okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ? patient: sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .","744":"doctor: okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again . patient: yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .","745":"doctor: okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ? patient: well , my hand is still bothering me .","746":"doctor: okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural . patient: okay . sounds good .","747":"doctor: all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards . patient: all right . is the mri today ?","748":"doctor: um , you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute , and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can . patient: all right .","749":"doctor: all right . well , it was nice meeting you , my friend . patient: you as well . thank you .","750":"doctor: physical exam , elderly white gentleman presents in a wheelchair . no apparent distress . per the template , down through neuro- neurologic . one plus bilateral biceps . triceps brachioradialis . reflexes bilateral all negative . follow up and take out the lower extremities . gait not assessed today . strength and sensation is per the template . uh , upper and lower extremities . musculoskeletal , he is non-tender over his cervical spine . he does have mildly restricted cervical exte- extension . right and left lateral rotation which is symmetric , which gives him mild lateral neck pain but no radi- radicular pain . spurling's maneuver is benign . paragraph , diagnostics . cervical x-ray 6421 . cervical x-ray reveals significant disc degeneration at c56 , and to a lower extent c45 and c34 . significant lower lumbar facet arthropathy c67 and c7-t1 is difficult to visualize in the current x-rays . paragraph , impression . number one , left upper extremity neuropathy suspicious for cervical radicularopathy . possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy . number two , neck pain in the setting of arthritis disc degeneration . paragraph , plan . i suspect that this is a flare of cervical radicularopathy . i'm going to set him up for a cervical mri , and we'll tentatively plan for a left c7-t1 epidural afterwards , although the exact location will be pending the mri results . he'll continue his home exercise program as well as twice a day gabapentin . we'll follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief . he denies any blood thinners .","751":"doctor: eugene walker , n- date of birth 4\/14\/1960 . he's a 61-year-old male who presents today , uh , for a routine follow-up with chronic medical conditions . of note , the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on 1\/22\/2013 . regarding his blood work from 4\/10\/2021 , the patient's alkaline phosphatate- phosphatase , excuse me , was elevated to 156 . his lipid panel showed elevated total cholesterol of 247 , hdl of 66 , ldl of 166 , and triglycerides at 74 . the patient's tsh was normal at 2.68 . his cbc was unremarkable . his most recent vitamin d level was at the high end of normal at 94 . good morning , mr. walker . how are you doing ?

but what about the other thing ?","818":"doctor: the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged . patient: but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?","819":"doctor: correct . patient: so what does that mean ?","820":"doctor: well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement . patient: okay .","821":"doctor: so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged . patient: could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ?","822":"doctor: no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that . patient: so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ?","823":"doctor: well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease . patient: so what do i need to do ?","824":"doctor: well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs . patient: okay . and then what ?","825":"doctor: we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too . patient: which medications ?","826":"doctor: crestor , how long have you been taking that ? patient: about 18 months .","827":"doctor: okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives . patient: should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ?","828":"doctor: i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol . patient: okay . i'll call him this afternoon .","829":"doctor: great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that . patient: okay . when do you think i'll be able to get the ultrasound done ?","830":"doctor: hopefully , within the next two weeks . you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up . patient: okay . and then what happens ?","831":"doctor: when i get the results from the test , i will contact you . and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps . patient: and when should i see you again ?","832":"doctor: uh , let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver . patient: okay . is there anything else i can do to help with these issues ?","833":"doctor: definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation . and be mindful of eating foods that you were sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea . patient: okay . and i'll talk to my primary care about my crestor .","834":"doctor: excellent . and do you have any other questions for me ? patient: i do n't think so .","835":"doctor: great . so remember when you check out the front desk , schedule follow-up appointment with me for four weeks and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn . patient: okay . sounds good .","836":"doctor: and expect a call from radiology scheduling about setting up your ultrasound . patient: all right . thanks , dr. edwards .","837":"doctor: thank you , mr. allen .","838":"doctor: next patient is sophia jackson , mrnr472348 . she's a 57 year old female who is here for a surgical consult . her dermatologist referred her . she biopsied a 0.7 millimeter lesion which was located on right inferior back . pathology came back as melanoma . mrs. jackson , it's good to meet you . patient: likewise , wish it were under better circumstances .","839":"doctor: yeah , i hear your dermatologist sent you to me 'cause she found a melanoma ? patient: yes , that's what the biopsy said .","840":"doctor: okay and when did you first notice the spot ? patient: my mom noticed it when i was visiting her last month .","841":"doctor: i see . and so you went to the dermatologist on april 10th to get it checked out , right ? patient: yes , i wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family .","842":"doctor: well i'm really glad you took it seriously and got it checked . who in your family has had skin cancer , and do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell ? patient: my mom and her sister , i think they both had melanoma .","843":"doctor: okay . do you have any other types of cancer in the family , like breast or ovarian ? patient: my grandfather had pancreatic cancer .","844":"doctor: okay , and was that your mom or dad's father ? patient: mother's .","845":"doctor: okay . and , um , have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ? patient: no , this was the first time i've been to a dermatologist . um , but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year at my physical and has n't said , um , he's concerned about any of 'em before .","846":"doctor: good- good . uh , let's go over your medical history from your chart . i have that you're not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you're allergic to augmentin , is that right ? patient: yes , that's correct .","847":"doctor: okay , and for social history can you tell me what you do for work ? patient: i own an auto repair shop .","848":"doctor: okay and have you ever been a smoker ? patient: yeah , i still smoke from time to time . i started that awful habit in my teens and it's hard to break , but i'm trying .","849":"doctor: i'm glad you're trying to quit . uh , what about your surgical history , have you had any surgeries ? patient: i had gall bladder and appendix .","850":"doctor: okay , great , we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been , any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ? patient: no , i've been feelin' great .","851":"doctor: good . well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind . patient: sure .","852":"doctor: okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ? patient: okay , that's fine .","853":"doctor: all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation . there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam . okay , you can sit up . um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about . uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further . patient: okay , i should n't worry too much then ?","854":"doctor: no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything . patient: okay , good .","855":"doctor: so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision . patient: okay , that is fine with me , i ca n't see back there anyways .","856":"doctor: yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it , as it heals . um , but since we're , we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems . however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly so she can monitor you . uh , your dermatologist will check that this one does n't come back , but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious . uh , unfortunately , since you've had one melanoma , you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else . patient: yeah , she did say she wants to see me back .","857":"doctor: good , and i'm sure she's already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight . patient: yeah , she definitely went over that , um , several times with me .","858":"doctor: good . other than that , i think that's all for me . um , we'll get you set up for the ultrasound , the procedure . do you have any questions for me ? patient: um , no i ca n't think of any at this time .","859":"doctor: okay , my nurse will be in to get you scheduled , so sit tight . it was very good to meet you . patient: thank you , nice to meet you as well .","860":"doctor: please add the following pathology r- , to results . a pathology , shave of right inferior back , malignant melanoma , invasive , superficial spreading . histology , superficial spreading . clark level 4 , breslow thickness 0.7 millimeters , radial growth phase present , vertical growth phase not identified . mitotic features , less than one millimeter squared . ulceration not identified , progression not identified , lymphatic invasion not identified , perineural invasion not identified , microscopic satellitosis not identified . infiltrating , uh , lymphocytes , breast . um , melanocytic nevus not identified . predominant cytology epithelioid , peripheral margin positive , deep margin , uh , negative , stage 1 . also note that i reviewed the dermatologist's photo of the lesion which showed an asymmetric black and brown nevus with central a melanotic component and irregular border . for assessment and plan , the patient presents today with newly diagnosed melanoma . biopsy revealed an intermediate thickness melanoma . on examination today , there is right inguinal lymph node with slightly atypical consistency . i recommended an ultrasound to rule out metastatic disease . if the ultrasound is normal , the patient is a candidate for wide local excision with a one to two centimeter margin . primary closure should be possible , but skin graft closure may be needed . the relationship between tumor histology and prognosis and treatment was carefully reviewed . the need for follow-up , according to the national comprehensive cancer network guidelines , was reviewed . we also reviewed the principles of sun avoidance , skin self-examination , and the abcdes of mole surveillance . after discussing the procedure , risk and expected outcomes , and possible complications , questions were answered and the patient expressed understanding and did choose to proceed .","861":"doctor: donna torres , date of birth , 08\/01\/1980 . hi donna ! how are you ? patient: i'm good . how about you ?","862":"doctor: i'm doing well , thank you . and so , i saw that dr. brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ? patient: no , that's new .","863":"doctor: okay . how is it working for you ? patient: my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , \" i can not do this . \" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what .","864":"doctor: mm . okay . patient: and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work .","865":"doctor: well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too . patient: i did .","866":"doctor: and that was before we started the progesterone . patient: yes .","867":"doctor: so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also . patient: yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .","868":"doctor: hmm , okay . patient: and it seemed like it was for no reason .","869":"doctor: but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time . patient: yes .","870":"doctor: all right . so not really a link there , all right . patient: yeah , i do n't know .","871":"doctor: yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too . patient: i figured maybe that's what it was .","872":"doctor: and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also . patient: yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .","873":"doctor: yeah , i can absolutely see that . patient: yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .","874":"doctor: well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ? patient: no .","875":"doctor: have you lost weight ? patient: no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , \" what is going on ? \"","876":"doctor: all right . patient: and now i am feeling better .","877":"doctor: okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner . patient: well , the past six months i have lost some weight .","878":"doctor: okay , good . um , anything else going on ? patient: no .","879":"doctor: all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative\/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ? patient: not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .","880":"doctor: all right , well , let's just repeat it then . patient: yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .","881":"doctor: okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check . patient: okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .","882":"doctor: have you had the vaccine ? patient: yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .","883":"doctor: okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do . patient: yeah , i agree .","884":"doctor: all right . well , let's complete your exam . patient: all right .","885":"doctor: so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps . patient: yeah , but they're not as big as they were .","886":"doctor: mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ? patient: it does , where your left hand just was .","887":"doctor: okay , right here ? patient: yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .","888":"doctor: yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away . patient: yeah .","889":"doctor: all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ? patient: yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .","890":"doctor: okay , great . all right , looks good . patient: good .","891":"doctor: you can go ahead and sit up . patient: thank you .","892":"doctor: all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now . patient: okay . and what could that mean ?","893":"doctor: well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign . patient: and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .","894":"doctor: well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed . patient: yeah .","895":"doctor: so those are all good things . patient: okay .","896":"doctor: because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change . patient: we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .","897":"doctor: yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them . patient: yeah , i agree there .","898":"doctor: um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it . patient: okay . i'll do whatever you think i should .","899":"doctor: all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule . patient: okay , i think that sounds great .","900":"doctor: all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ? patient: no , i think i'm all set .","901":"doctor: all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else . patient: all right , thank you . you have a good day too .","902":"doctor: all right .","903":"doctor: sophia brown . date of birth , 3\/17\/1946 . this is a new patient visit . she's here to establish care for a history of dcis . we'll go over the history with the patient . hello , ms. brown . patient: hi . yes , that's me .","904":"doctor: wonderful . i'm doctor stewart . it's lovely to meet you . patient: you as well .","905":"doctor: so , you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lumpectomy last year . is that right ? patient: yes . on january 20th , 2020 .","906":"doctor: okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ? patient: no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .","907":"doctor: perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ? patient: sounds good .","908":"doctor: great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ? patient: it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .","909":"doctor: i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters . patient: yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .","910":"doctor: yep , definitely . based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ . patient: yes . unfortunately .","911":"doctor: i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great ! patient: yeah , i was definitely very relieved .","912":"doctor: and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal . patient: yes .","913":"doctor: okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ? patient: yes . fingers crossed .","914":"doctor: definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you . patient: okay , sounds good .","915":"doctor: i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ? patient: i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .","916":"doctor: okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ? patient: gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .","917":"doctor: okay . do you have children ? patient: i do . i have five .","918":"doctor: ah , big family then . that's nice . patient: yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .","919":"doctor: i bet . sounds like fun . patient: it is .","920":"doctor: did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ? patient: really , i did not .","921":"doctor: okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ? patient: my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .","922":"doctor: okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those . patient: okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .","923":"doctor: okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ? patient: that's correct .","924":"doctor: okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ? patient: yes , and that's all .","925":"doctor: okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er\/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ? patient: i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .","926":"doctor: okay . and how about family history ? patient: my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .","927":"doctor: all right . any family history of breast cancer ? patient: none .","928":"doctor: did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ? patient: i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .","929":"doctor: wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ? patient: no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .","930":"doctor: excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ? patient: nope , just penicillin .","931":"doctor: okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you . okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes . in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero . do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ? patient: i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .","932":"doctor: okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you . patient: okay , sounds good .","933":"doctor: as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er\/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy . so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you . patient: okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?","934":"doctor: in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me . patient: okay , i can do that .","935":"doctor: wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ? patient: i do n't think so .","936":"doctor: okay , great . my nurse will be in shortly to discharge you . take care ! patient: you as well .","937":"doctor: good morning ms. reyes ! patient: good morning .","938":"doctor: how are you doing ma'am ? patient: i'm doing well doctor , how are you ?","939":"doctor: i am fine thank you . so you've been having some problems with your right hip ? patient: yeah .","940":"doctor: okay , and where are you hurting ? can you show me ? patient: right in the groin area .","941":"doctor: okay , and this has been going on since february 2020 ? patient: yeah .","942":"doctor: okay . and is it worse with movement ? patient: well when it catches and i almost fall , yeah .","943":"doctor: okay . so it kinda grabs you ? patient: yeah .","944":"doctor: okay , and this all started when you were walking ? patient: well , walking around the infusion room .","945":"doctor: okay , so now it hurts whenever you move ? patient: it hurts when i pivot .","946":"doctor: okay . so if you pivot then it hurts , got it . um ... patient: anything can sometimes do it . sometimes it wo n't though , and sometimes it'll do it several times in a row .","947":"doctor: several times in a row , okay . patient: and sometimes i fall .","948":"doctor: okay . and you rate the pain to range from two through seven out of 10 ? patient: yeah , that's correct .","949":"doctor: okay . and are you experiencing fever or chills ? patient: no .","950":"doctor: okay . and any tingling or numbness ? patient: no .","951":"doctor: and have you had any problems with your bowel or bladder ? patient: no .","952":"doctor: okay . and if you stay still , do you feel better ? patient: yes , but i do n't want to stay still .","953":"doctor: i understand , no problem . and for past medical history , do you have anything going on ? patient: i've had a lot of surgeries . i've had pcl , i had infertility , a gall bladder

weather was perfect this weekend so i'm glad you at least got outside sorry to hear you got hurt okay so your right knee did you did you feel it like pop or or snap or anything when you hurt it patient: yeah i felt a little pop and then it swelled up really big afterward","992":"doctor: okay did you try anything for the pain patient: i took some ibuprofen and i put some ice on

patient: it hurts quite a bit to stand but i am able to put weight on it","995":"doctor: okay alright and what part of the knee is it inside outside middle patient: kind of that inside part of my kneecap","996":"doctor: okay alright and okay so as long as you're here and then your primary care physician i'm looking through your chart and it looks like we're treating your diabetes so how you've been doing with your your diet overall are you are you keeping your sugars low patient: it's going okay i i forget to check quite a bit though","997":"doctor: yeah i understand how has your diet been lately patient: it's been pretty good","998":"doctor: okay okay good good you know it's hard to stay away from the sugary foods sometimes i i enjoy ice cream regularly okay so let's do physical exam as long as you are here so i'm just gon na listen to your heart your heart sounds normal no murmurs or gallops listen to your lungs quick if you can take a deep breath lungs are clear that's good news let's take a look at that knee right knee looks like it definitely has some swelling i'm gon na do some maneuvers here does it hurt when i push you on the inside of the knee patient: yeah that hurts","999":"doctor: okay how about the outside patient: a little bit but not as much","1000":"doctor: okay so some pain on palpation on the inside little bit of pain on the outside of the knee if i bend the knee back does that hurt patient: yeah","1001":"doctor: how about when i extend it patient: yeah that hurts","1002":"doctor: okay so little bit of limited range of motion as well as pain on both flexion and extension on the knee i'm gon na push on this a little bit looks like your mcmurray's test is negative just checking for a meniscus tear okay so let's talk a little bit about your plan what i am concerned about for your knee is it sounds like you have a torn or injured mcl i it's that inside tendon in your knee so i'm concerned about that since you're having trouble with weightbearing and you heard that pop so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na put you in a straight leg brace and i'll prescribe some mobic you can start taking that as a a pain reliever and to try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice your knee once an hour for about fifteen minutes but i'm also gon na send you out for an mri because we wan na make sure this is what happens see if there's any other damage to the knee does that sound good patient: yeah that sounds great thank you","1003":"doctor: yeah and then for your diabetes as long as you're here it sounds like you're managing that pretty well but i do wan na get a recheck on your hemoglobin a1c and then i'm also i'm going to get a refill on the metformin that you have been taking five hundred milligrams so you can keep taking that as well so do you have any other questions for me patient: no that's it thanks","1004":"doctor: alright well thank you hope that you feel better","1005":"doctor: hey alan i good to see you today so i looked here my appointment notes and i see that you're coming in you had some shoulder pain left shoulder pain for the last three weeks so how you doing is it is it gotten any better patient: yeah yeah i've been having a lot of pain of my shoulder for the last three weeks now and it's not getting better","1006":"doctor: okay do you remember what you were doing when the pain first started patient: so i i was thinking that i i ca n't recall like falling on it injuring it getting hit","1007":"doctor: okay so do you remember hitting it or anything like that patient: no nothing at all","1008":"doctor: okay alright did you fall do you remember doing that patient: no","1009":"doctor: okay hmmm so like a little mystery so have you had pain in that shoulder before patient: i mean i'm very active so i can get pains in my shoulders but it's nothing that sometime some tylenol can help","1010":"doctor: okay and are you able to move the arm or is it kinda just stuck patient: i'm having a lot of pain like i can move it but you know when i try to reach for something lifting anything and even like i do n't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain","1011":"doctor: alright so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder patient: it actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder it does n't go down anywhere","1012":"doctor: okay and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go patient: it's pretty much all the time anytime i put any pressure on it like when i'm trying to sleep it hurts even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well","1013":"doctor: okay so i know you mentioned tylenol patient: so this time i have n't taken anything for it","1014":"doctor: okay did you try icing it at all patient: i iced it initially but i have n't iced it at all recently","1015":"doctor: alright and so with your shoulder have you experienced any numbness in your arm or in your fingers patient: no numbness or tingling","1016":"doctor: okay good so i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam and take a look at your your shoulder so i reviewed your your vitals everything looks good with that so touch here in your shoulder so your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion so pressure here so that there is tenderness of the greater patient: okay","1017":"doctor: tuberosity of the humerus let's see there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro patient: yeah","1018":"doctor: acromioclavicular joints patient: yeah","1019":"doctor: yeah and looks like you have good hand grip let me see so on the neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is is intact to light touch patient: yes thank you","1020":"doctor: yep so you did get a we get we had to get a x-ray of your shoulder before you came in and so it's normal so that's really good so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you you do have that left shoulder pain so your symptoms are most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured tendon you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na order an mri of your left shoulder  and so we're gon na begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on have you done physical therapy before patient: i have n't","1021":"doctor: okay so what i'm gon na do i'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder and that should definitely help with the pain during that time you can also continue to take tylenol i do n't think i need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you so if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which should provide some relief but i think right now we can just go with the the pt and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury so do you have any questions about the plan patient: so like i said i'm really active do you think that this pain will ever go away","1022":"doctor: yeah so many patients are very successful with rehab and so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time once we build up those muscles around that shoulder you know things things the pain alleviates itself and and and you will be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights all all the active things people do these days patient: okay alright thank you","1023":"doctor: well hello christina so how are you doing i was notified you were in the hospital for some heart failure what happened patient: well i'm doing better now but i just started having problems that my ankles were swelling and could n't get them to go down even when i went to bed and could n't breathe very good had to get propped up in bed so i could breathe at night and so i just really got to feeling bad i called my friend diane and she said i probably ought to call nine one one since i was having a hard time talking and so i called nine one one and they sent out an ambulance and they took me into the er on the it was quite an experience","1024":"doctor: i'm sure you do n't yeah i see that your blood pressure was high also it was two hundred over ninety have you been patient: yeah i guess is that really high","1025":"doctor: yeah that's patient: i feel really bad","1026":"doctor: yeah that's pretty high are you taking your medications or you missing some doses patient: i do n't know i might miss one now but i try to take them all time","1027":"doctor: yeah yeah you really need to take them very consistently now you also said you were watching your diet did you did you have some slips with that you said your ankles were swelling patient: no i yeah i do i like to i like to eat","1028":"doctor: are you eating a lot of salty foods and pizza or patient: i like potato chips","1029":"doctor: well

name salt and vinitive because brand wo n't taste real good but the the brand names really tastes good","1030":"doctor: goodness well you know you we need to probably stop eating those now patient: yeah well i hate to hate to give those up but i guess i might have to","1031":"doctor: well since you've been in the hospital and and they've helped you out with some with all that how are you feeling now patient: well i'm i'm doing better","1032":"doctor: mm-hmm and they patient: i do n't do n't have quite as much shortness of breath i think maybe getting up and walking a little more is helping","1033":"doctor: and they gave you a water pill and is that is that helping is that making you pee a lot patient: yeah yeah i have almost incontinence so","1034":"doctor: goodness patient: yes that's not very pleasant at all","1035":"doctor: and so they added another blood pressure medication also how are you doing with that are you feeling a little bit better patient: yeah i think so","1036":"doctor: well a a pill box or maybe setting an alarm on your phone might really help patient: okay i'll i'll give that a try anything that will help","1037":"doctor: yeah okay well that's good to hear so now have you bought a blood pressure cuff to have at home now patient: yes i already had one but i very failed if i ever used it","1038":"doctor: okay and you might even just keep a log of what your blood pressures are and when it's up think about you know what you've eaten if you've done something different because that may help you to figure out what you need to cut back on or how you might need to change your your eating habits a little bit so patient: okay okay","1039":"doctor: have you been short of breath or any problems sleeping since you've been home patient: no i've been sleeping like a log","1040":"doctor: okay good alright have you had any chest pain patient: no no chest pain","1041":"doctor: okay alright well let's do a quick physical exam here so your vital signs your blood pressure looks pretty good today at one twenty eight over seventy two your temperature is ninety eight . seven and your heart rate is seventy two your respirations are eighteen your oxygen saturation looks pretty good at at ninety six percent okay now on your neck exam there is no jugular venous distention on your heart exam i appreciate a two over six systolic ejection murmur which i've heard before and so it's stable and your lungs are clear bilaterally and your lower extremities show just trace edema now now we since we did the echocardiogram i reviewed those results and it does show a preserved ef of fifty five percent abnormal diastolic filling and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem for your congestive heart failure it sounds like this was caused by dietary indiscretion and some uncontrolled hypertension so i want you to continue on your bumex two milligrams once daily continue to watch your diet and avoid salty foods might try keeping that log we talked about with your blood pressures and what you've eaten if if your blood pressure seems a little high also weigh yourself daily and call me if you gain three pounds in two days okay patient: okay","1042":"doctor: and i also want you to see a nutritionist to give you some education about what foods you can eat okay now for your second problem for i know this sounds like this is just for you and so for your second problem for your hypertension i want you to continue on the cozaar one hundred milligrams daily continue on the norvasc five milligrams once daily also and i'm going to order a renal artery ultrasound just to be sure we're not missing anything and then like maybe you know some renal artery stenosis or something and so so for your third problem for your kidney disease i wan na get some more labs to make sure you tolerate this the new medications and then i'll see you again in three months do you have any questions patient: no i do n't think so not today","1043":"doctor: alright it's good to see you and i hope we'll just keep getting you feeling better patient:

work patient: landscaping landscaping","1048":"doctor: landscaping okay so a lot of raking a lot of digging so a lot of repetitive type movements patient: yeah it's pretty heavy labor but it's yeah the same thing day in and day out","1049":"doctor: okay okay just a couple questions for you you did say that you have the pain at night in that and you have to you get that numbness into the hand is it in all the fingers patient: yeah it seems to happen to all my fingers but i notice it more in my thumb and pointer finger","1050":"doctor: okay okay and anything into that little into your fifth finger your little finger any numbness there at times no patient: sometimes yeah it seems like it's numb too","1051":"doctor: okay what about your right hand any problems with that hand patient: no i do n't seem to have any problems with my right hand so far it's just mostly my left","1052":"doctor: okay okay good and just a couple you know do you how do you have many or do you drink often do you have you know many any alcohol consumption patient: i drink usually a a beer or two on fridays and saturdays on the weekends","1053":"doctor: okay and do you have any evidence of any anybody ever said that you had some rheumatoid arthritis in your hand or wrist anything like that patient: no nobody say anything like that so i mean","1054":"doctor: okay okay good so let me go ahead and do a physical exam here real quick and you know i'm gon na quickly just listen to your heart and lungs okay that's good i'd like you to squeeze i'm gon na hold your hands here and i'd like you to squeeze both hands patient: okay","1055":"doctor: you seem a little bit weaker on that left hand is that what you've noticed patient: yeah i i i experienced some weakness in my left hand","1056":"doctor: okay do you you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or patient: yeah i drop things mostly because i have a hard time feeling it","1057":"doctor: okay okay good and so you you do have a a grip strength is less on the left and i just wan na touch your fingers here on the on the right side you can feel me touching all the fingers on the right patient: yeah i can i can say you touch me but it feels a little more weird on the thumb side than my pointer finger side","1058":"doctor: okay okay and i wan na turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over and i'm gon na go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back here does that do anything when i do that patient: i still i feel a little jolt or a zing in my finger tips","1059":"doctor: okay and then when i do that on the left side patient: yeah same thing","1060":"doctor: same thing okay so you do have a bilateral positive tinel's sign so so here's here's where i'm at i think your your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping the heavy labor and you you know your your clinical exam and and history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome i do want to order so where are we gon na go from here i would like to order a a study it's called an emg where it it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers we will follow up with that but as far as your treatment so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification now i know you are a landscaper is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time patient: i suppose i could try to pass it off to some of my other employes and delegate","1061":"doctor: okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you patient: yeah it sounds like a good first start","1062":"doctor: okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do patient: mostly like yard work and maintenance flower beds not really designing just up keep","1063":"doctor: okay yeah i'm looking for a landscape designer i need somebody to put in some elaborate walkways back through the backyard so yeah we can do stuff like that i mean if you have an idea what you want i think that's easy patient: okay you know if you're looking for like some backyard elasis rehab remodel that's i mean i suppose we could do we have n't done things like that in a while because we're busy enough with just the up key but it's something to explore","1064":"doctor: okay yeah i may have to keep that in mind because i do wan na do some of that so let's listen i'm gon na get my my nurse in here to discharge you do you have any other questions for me before we end this patient: no i think it's all clear i appreciate it","1065":"doctor: okay take care and i'll look forward to see you in two weeks patient: very good appreciate your

your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow patient: you do a stick needle in my elbow","1102":"doctor: mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow patient: so it's kinda like dry needling then","1103":"doctor: what is it patient: is it is that that thing where like you take the blood out of like say my my thigh","1104":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: and then you literally inject it into my tendon","1105":"doctor: yeah that's exactly what it is patient: interesting cool","1106":"doctor: we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so

here my my notes here is you here he had positive lab work for hep c so how're you doing today patient: i'm doing okay but i'm a little bit anxious about having hep c i've really surprised because i've been feeling fine they had done it as you know a screen as just part of my physical so i'm really surprised that that came back positive","1113":"doctor: okay so in the past have any doctors ever told you that you had hep c patient: no never that's why i'm i'm so surprised","1114":"doctor: okay so just you know i need to ask do you have a history of iv drug use or you know have known any hep c partners patient: i mean i used to party a lot and even did use iv drugs but i have been clean for over fifteen years now","1115":"doctor: okay that that's good i mean i'm i'm happy that you were able to to kick that habit i know a lot of my patients that i see you know they're still dealing with with those dements so i'm i'm i'm happy that you're able to do that so hopefully we can get you better okay patient: thank you","1116":"doctor: so what about alcohol use is that something that you used to do a lot patient: i did i did i mean i i still have a beer here and there everyday but not as much as i used to","1117":"doctor: okay and have you ever smoked before patient: i do smoke i smoke about one to two cigarettes per day i've cut down a lot but i'm just having a hard time kicking those less too","1118":"doctor: yeah yeah and that that's something i've got to work on too because hep c along with smoking you know both of those are n't are n't good so hopefully we can help you out you know if your pcp has n't prescribe something for you already and possibly we can we can do that for you as well patient: okay","1119":"doctor: so do you have any other medical conditions patient: no i'm actually other than that i just had my physical and i'm not taking any medications no i'm i'm pretty good otherwise","1120":"doctor: okay and what conditions would you say run in your family patient: i have high blood pressure diabetes and depression","1121":"doctor: okay alright so let me go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good and on general appearance you appear to be in no distress no jaundice on the skin on your heart exam you have a nice regular rhythm rate regular rate and rhythm with a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur is appreciated on your lung exam your lungs are clear without wheezes rales or rhonchi on your abdominal exam bowel sounds are present your abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly yes let me i will change that one splenomegaly and on your muscle exam there is no gait disturbance or edema so i did we i was able to review your your results of your recent lab work and your hcv antibody test was positive so your your liver panel we did one of those and it showed an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so that's pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you do have hepatitis c so your initial labs were consistent with that hep c diagnosis and so you know i do n't know if you read much about hep c but hepatitis c is a viral infection that does affect your liver and you've most likely had it for several years now it it it most patients do n't see symptoms until years later so the next step that i would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work so that includes checking your hep c rna and your hcv genotype and i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and we will do that by ordering an ultrasound elasto elastography with this information we will we we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment right so how does that sound patient: i hmmm so i do have a wife and kids so should i be worried about them","1122":"doctor: okay yeah so we can start with the same screening that you had for august first so we'll just let's do that hep c antibody test and i'll actually help you set up those appointments with your your family doctor and then we can just see you back in three weeks and based on the results you know we will take action as needed okay patient: okay that sounds good","1123":"doctor: alright patient: alright","1124":"doctor: my nurse will be in with those those orders patient: alright thank you","1125":"doctor: alright thanks patient: bye","1126":"doctor: hi virginia how are you today what brings you in patient: i'm doing alright i started seeing this new pcp last year and you know she has been doing a lot of changes to my medication and making sure everything is up to date and she my noticed that my blood pressure has been quite high so she added to medications but and but i you know i've been taking them i've been really good and i i before i was n't but now i am and we're still having a hard time controlling my blood pressure so she thought it would be a good idea for me to see you especially since she noted some on my last blood work she said something about my kidneys","1127":"doctor: okay yeah so okay let's before i dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling patient: i would say you know most of the days i feel fine i'm still busy at work i definitely can tell though when my blood pressure is high","1128":"doctor: okay you measure it at home you you you measure your blood pressure at home patient: yeah i she wanted me to get a blood pressure cuff so i did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week","1129":"doctor: yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home patient: yeah she i have a a electronic one an electronic arm one","1130":"doctor: okay okay yeah that's good that's good and have you ever tried do you go to cvs at all patient: yeah i i do but i've noticed like since the pandemic i do n't see the blood pressures anymore","1131":"doctor: okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so patient: did they","1132":"doctor: you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally patient: alright do you want the honest answer","1133":"doctor: well yeah that would be better patient: so i really you know with everything going on i really been trying to get better but i mean during football season it's really difficult i really love watching my games so have a lot of pizza wings subs like i said i've been trying to cut down especially on days where there is no games but it probably could be better","1134":"doctor: okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches patient: really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis","1135":"doctor: okay what about chest pain patient: no chest pain","1136":"doctor: shortness of breath patient: no shortness of breath","1137":"doctor: even with exertion patient: even with exertion","1138":"doctor: okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed patient: not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no","1139":"doctor: okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure patient: both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease","1140":"doctor: okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on patient: yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on","1141":"doctor: okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve patient: yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday","1142":"doctor: okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for patient: i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends","1143":"doctor: okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me patient: no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control","1144":"doctor: yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan patient: that sounds good thank you","1145":"doctor: okay take care i'll talk to you later patient: okay alright bye","1146":"doctor: carolyn is a 34 -year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type two who is here today with a headache so hi there carolyn it's nice to see you again listen i'm sorry you're having headaches well let's talk about it but i would like to record this conversation with this app that's gon

hot and sometimes i just feel a little bit dizzy when i get these headaches but i've taken tylenol and advil and it's not really going away it just keeps coming back","1148":"doctor: okay and alright and so this started about a week ago has it been fairly constant since it started or does it come and go does it come and go or what patient: it comes and goes i it it's relieved when i take my tylenol or advil but then it comes right back","1149":"doctor: hmmm okay and do you notice any any timing difference you know is it is it worse in the morning worse in the evening is there anything else that makes it better or worse patient: it's definitely worse in the evening","1150":"doctor: okay and do you feel any sort of tightness in the back of your neck or in your shoulders or you know you said it's in the back of your head primarily any discomfort anywhere else patient: yes no just in the back of my head","1151":"doctor: okay and did the headache start all of a sudden carolyn or has it been gradual or what patient: i've been under a lot of stress lately so maybe about when some stress started occurring","1152":"doctor: okay okay and alright and have you noticed any fever along with the headache patient: no no fever","1153":"doctor: okay and any visual changes you know wavy lines in your vision spots in your vision or anything like that patient: no","1154":"doctor: okay and have you had headaches like this before patient: i have","1155":"doctor: okay so this is n't the worst headache you've ever had what did you say patient: no it's not","1156":"doctor: okay alright and so okay fair enough now how's your diabetes been been been doing lately have you what have your blood sugars been running in the low one hundreds or two hundreds or what patient: i have n't been checking my blood sugars","1157":"doctor: really okay well we will get you back on that and and we can talk about that but how about your metformin are you still taking the five hundred milligrams once a day no actually it looks like we increased your metformin to five hundred milligrams twice a day last visit are you still taking that patient: yes","1158":"doctor: okay great and okay you're still watching your diet and getting some exercise patient: i have not been eating well because i've been stressed over the last week but i have n't been exercising for maybe the past week but generally i've been doing better","1159":"doctor: okay the headache has has maybe made you feel uncomfortable and prevented your your exercise would you say or what patient: yes it has","1160":"doctor: okay okay so you probably have n't been out golfing i remember you're a big golfer so not not lately uh so you know being patient: not lately","1161":"doctor: being down being down here in florida we got ta get get some golf in so hey did you see the masters by the way a few weeks ago was n't that i do n't know did you happen to catch it patient: i did","1162":"doctor: yeah that was crazy what a what a finish what an amazing what an amazing tournament right what do you think yeah yeah that's great well we'll we'll get you feeling better and get you back out there and now are you still working a lot on the computer ac or patient: i am","1163":"doctor: carolyn okay yeah you're still working a lot on the computer for work okay are you taking breaks every hour or so you know get up stand around walk stand walk around that can be helpful patient: no i really do n't get the opportunity to","1164":"doctor: hmmm okay understood alright well listen let's go ahead and examine you okay so so on your physical exam your physical exam is pretty normal unremarkable for the most part and you know few things a few exceptions so first of all on your heent exam your eye exam your extraocular motions are intact without pain you have a funduscopic exam that shows no papilledema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back of your eye and on your neck exam you do have some posterior mild posterior paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well and otherwise on your exam let's see your heart exam on your heart exam you have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam so it just means i hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and i'm not too worried about that we'll watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable and so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan so carolyn for your first problem of the headache i do think that you have a tension type headache and i think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders and you know working at the computer i think is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that tylenol for the pain i'm also gon na give you a mild muscle relaxant i'll write you for flexeril five milligrams three times a day and you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms i want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worsen or you develop a fever but i do n't think that this is a a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that i think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus let's continue you on the metformin five hundred milligrams i am going to order a hemoglobin a1c and also a cbc and a chem-12 to check some of your blood tests blood chemistries and so forth and we will continue you on the metformin i do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful so when you come back in a month i want you to bring those numbers with you we can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine that's really gon na help you keep those blood sugars under control as well okay so how does that sound for a plan any other questions for me patient: well would it so only call if if it gets worse or not any better","1165":"doctor: yeah that that just right but also let's set up an appointment in four weeks and i wan na see you back in four weeks if it's not if the headache is not better within the next few days with this flexeril then you can give us a call and and get back in later this week or early next but definitely if things get worse give us a call sooner and you know i meant to ask you on i wanted to ask if you had a history of any any trauma meaning have you hit your head or you have n't fallen hit your head or anything like that have you patient: no no i think it's just stress","1166":"doctor: okay alright understood okay great well then i'll see you back in a month if not before okay you take care of yourself nice seeing you patient: thank you","1167":"doctor: hi teresa what's going on i heard that i heard that you're having a sore throat you're not feeling well patient: yeah my throat has been hurting me for like four four days now and i think i had a fever last night because i was really sweaty but i did n't take my temperature because i was already in bed","1168":"doctor: okay alright so four days ago you started feeling badly okay now were you having chills patient: yeah last night i was chills and i had lot of sweating and it's really hard to swallow","1169":"doctor: it's really hard to swallow okay now do you have pain every time you swallow or is it just periodically patient: every time i swallow i'm even having trouble eating i can drink okay the like really cold water feels good","1170":"doctor: okay that's what i was gon na ask you okay so you're able to drink water and are you able to drink any other fluids have you been able to drink any you know i do n't know juices or milk shakes or anything like that patient: well besides my wine at night i really just drink water all day","1171":"doctor: okay well i like to drink wine too what's your favorite type of wine patient: peanut grooves yes","1172":"doctor: it's a good one i like that too i am also a pino navar fan so there you go alright well let's now do you feel sick to your stomach at all patient: no i have a little bit of a stuffy nose not too bad it's really just my throat but i think my tonsils are swollen too","1173":"doctor: and your tonsils are swollen too now has anyone else sick in your household patient: i do have little kids that go to school so they've always got you know those little runny noses or cough but nobody is really complaining of anything","1174":"doctor: okay alright now have you had strep throat in the past patient: when i was a kid i had strep throat but i have n't had anything like that as an adult","1175":"doctor: okay alright and what do you do for work patient: i i work as a cashier in a supermarket","1176":"doctor: okay alright and did you get your covid vaccine patient: yep i did get my covid vaccine but it really made me feel sick so i'm hoping i do n't have to get another one later this year","1177":"doctor: okay did so you just got the two vaccines you did n't get the booster patient: no i did n't get the booster because i really have n't had time to feel that sick again it really knocked me down for like two days and with the little kids it's really hard","1178":"doctor: okay alright well i saw that they did a rapid covid test when you came in here and that was negative so that's good so you do n't have covid which is which is good now let's talk a little bit about your hypertension and hypertension since i have you here did you ever buy that blood pressure cuff that i asked you to buy patient: yes i did i blood the blood pressure cuff and my blood pressure is like all over the place sometimes it could be like one twenty for the top number sometimes it could be one forty for the top number i i do n't really remember the bottom number though","1179":"doctor: okay that's okay are you taking the lisinopril i think we have you on twenty milligrams a day patient: yep i take it every morning with my multivitamin and my vitamin d","1180":"doctor: okay alright and are you watching your salt intake patient: i really like my chips with my wine","1181":"doctor: is n't that the best we we could get along really well outside of here alright and then tell me a little bit about your diabetes now are you are you watching your blood sugars are you taking them at home patient: sometimes i take that all that often again that could be all over the place sometimes i get if i take it first thing in the morning it'll be like eighty or ninety but at night sometimes it could be one forty","1182":"doctor: okay alright and i are you still taking the metformin we have you on a thousand milligrams twice a day patient: uh uh yes i do take it i take it with my breakfast and with my dinner","1183":"doctor: okay alright great alright now are you are you a meds fan or a yankie's fan or god for a bit of filly's fan patient: nope","1184":"doctor: do n't like sports just the wine patient: no","1185":"doctor: okay alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam now i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking here first at your vital signs your vital signs look pretty good you do have a low-grade fever of about a hundred . four right now but otherwise your blood pressure is pretty good it's about one thirty two over eighty and your heart rate is eighty four now that looks pretty good so i'm just gon na go ahead and examine you so on your facial exam i'm gon na just press on your face here does this hurt patient: no not no it does n't bother me","1186":"doctor: okay on facial examination the patient has no pain to palpation of the frontal or maxillary sinuses on nasal examination there is edema and erythema of the nasal turbinates bilaterally with associated clear discharge open up your mouth and say patient: ah","1187":"doctor: on throat examination there is bilateral erythema and edema of the peritonsillar space with exudates present bilaterally the uvula is midline on your neck exam i do appreciate some cervical lymphadenopathy on the right hand side on your lung exam your lungs you have some coarse rhonchi at the bases that clear with cough and on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur or or rub so what does all of that mean teresa so all of that means is that yes you're showing signs of what we call an upper respiratory infection and i'm concerned that you might have some strep in the back of your throat based on the findings so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you okay so for your first problem of your sore throat i'm gon na go ahead and have the medical assistant come in and swab you for a rapid strep test and if that's positive i wan na go ahead and place you on or prescribe amoxicillin five hundred milligrams three times a day for ten days and i'm gon na give you some lidocaine swish and swallow so that will help with some of the pain and you can take some ibuprofen as needed which will also help with the pain and some of that fever okay i do want you to go ahead and continue to to hydrate as much as possible what kind of questions do you have about that patient: no that sounds good i just wanted to be sure i was okay because of the little kids","1188":"doctor: sure now for your next problem of your hypertension i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel on you and i think i do wan na increase i do wan na increase the lisinopril to forty milligrams once a day just to get your blood pressure under better control and we'll see how you do on the forty milligrams once a day for your third problem of your diabetes let's go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and just to make sure that we do n't have to make any adjustments to your metformin how does that sound patient: sounds good","1189":"doctor: any questions patient: nope that's everything","1190":"doctor: okay bye good to see you i'll be in touch","1191":"doctor: good morning carolyn how are you patient: i'm doing alright other than this ankle pain i've been having","1192":"doctor: so i see here that you hurt your right ankle can you tell me what happened patient: yeah so yesterday i was going to take out the trash and it was quite icy i thought i was doing okay job and i just slipped and and fell and i'm pretty sure i heard a pop","1193":"doctor: okay and you said this happened yesterday correct patient: yeah","1194":"doctor: okay and have you been able to walk on it at all patient: no i was so initially when i first fell i was unable to walk at on it at all i had a friend that was visiting and so she heard me fall so she helped me inside now today i have been able to put a little bit more weight on it but i'm still limping","1195":"doctor: okay and then what have you been doing for your foot or ankle pain since that happened patient: so i like iced it last night and kept it elevated and i also took some ibuprofen last night and this morning before coming in today","1196":"doctor: okay and can you rate your pain for me patient: i would say right now it's like a four out of ten","1197":"doctor: okay and does the ibuprofen help with that pain patient: it does it does help with the pain","1198":"doctor: okay and when you take your ibuprofen what can you what's your pain level then patient: so this so what did i just say four","1199":"doctor: yes ma'am patient: four out of ten so four out of ten is with ibuprofen","1200":"doctor: it's with ibuprofen okay what's your pain level without then patient: i would say probably a six","1201":"doctor: okay alright that that sounds good have you ever injured that foot and ankle before patient: you know i've had a lot of injuries to my ankle but i've never hurt this ankle before i just realized an error","1202":"doctor: okay you know and i see here that you have a history of playing sports looks like you played soccer in college and then played a little bit of a inner marrow soccer now patient: yeah","1203":"doctor: i'm i'm guessing you probably have n't been able to do that since you hurt your ankle patient: no i have not been","1204":"doctor: so did you hear about the new major league soccer stadium and team that's coming to town they opened in the this year actually they built the stadium have you been down there yet patient: no i have to get there","1205":"doctor: yeah we are all excited it's going to be a good time well have you experienced any numbness or tingling in that right foot patient: no","1206":"doctor: okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam your vitals look good and everything there looks okay now i'm gon na do a focused exam on your right ankle i do appreciate some ecchymosis or bruising over the lateral malleolus malleolus associated with some edema or swelling of that area you are positive for tenderness to palpation of the anterior lateral soft tissue and now i do n't appreciate any laxity on anterior drawer and inversion stress there is no bony tenderness on palpation to that foot or ankle area now on neurovascular exam of your right foot you have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch and all of that is consistent with what's present on your left side as well so i did review the results of your of your x-ray the x-ray of your right ankle showed no fracture which is a good thing so now let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for the first problem of right ankle pain your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain or i'm sorry right ankle sprain of your lateral ligament complex more specifically your anterior talofibular ligament now this ligament's on the outside of your ankle ankle which got stretched when you fell the best treatment at this time for your sprain is to keep your leg elevated when you're seated and let's continue to ice okay you're gon na be given an air cast which is gon na help stabilize that ankle and i'm also going to prescribe some crutches because i want you to stay off that leg and start walking on it stay off your leg for now and then in a couple of days start walking on it as tolerated do you have any questions or concerns for me patient: so how long do you think it'll take to heal","1207":"doctor: so your symptoms should significantly improve over a few weeks but i'd like to follow up with you and see how you're doing let's say i'll see you again in fourteen days now i do want you to go ahead and continue to take nsaids or ibuprofen as needed to help with any pain and that's also gon na help reduce that inflammation and swelling okay patient: okay","1208":"doctor: alright i will see you again in two weeks carolyn patient: great thank you","1209":"doctor: you're welcome","1210":"doctor: how are you doing patient: i'm doing i'm good i'm i'm doing really good i'm here i'm just ready to quit smoking and but i've been having quite a hard time with it","1211":"doctor: well i'm glad that you're taking the first steps to quit smoking would you tell me a little bit more about your history of smoking patient: yeah so i've been smoking for some time now i started in high school and was just you know just experimenting and smoking here and there with friends or at parties and then it just started getting more regular and regular and i do n't even know how i'm 44 now and i'm smoking everyday so yes now i'm up to a pack and a half a day","1212":"doctor: okay do you use any other type of tobacco products patient: no smoking is enough","1213":"doctor: okay and i understand that so when you wake up in the morning how soon after waking up do you smoke your first cigarette patient: i would say probably within an hour of waking up i'll have my first cigarette","1214":"doctor: okay so i'm really excited that you wan na quit and i know that you probably heard this multiple times before but this really is one of the best things that you can do to help your health especially since you have the history of gout and type two diabetes this is really gon na be a great step in you having better long term health outcomes patient: yeah i know and you know i'm really motivated now because i am about to be a father any day now and i just really wan na be there for my daughter growing up","1215":"doctor: hey that's great and that's great to hear congratulations i'm so excited to hear about the new baby patient: yeah","1216":"doctor: i i have a daughter myself have have you

congratulations again i'm very excited for you and your and and your wife that that's this is great patient: thank you","1218":"doctor: so you mentioned you tried to quit before can you tell me a little bit about the methods that you used or or what you tried patient: yeah actually i just went cold turkey one day i woke up and i said you know i've had enough and i know that smoking is not good for me so i woke up and stopped and i actually did really well and i was able to quit smoking for almost a year and then things just started getting really stressful at work they started laying people off and i'm happy i still have a job but that also meant that i was responsible for more things so things just got stressful and i and just started picking it up again","1219":"doctor: well you are absolutely correct you know stress can often be a trigger for things like smoking and drinking have you thought what you would do this time when you encountered the stressful situations patient: yeah i i did n't think about that a lot actually and one thing is i have started learning and trying to do more meditation and then i also just recently joined the gym so i'm really looking forward to working out again","1220":"doctor: okay well that's great to hear that you're getting back in the gym that will be good for your long term health too you know helping to maintain that type two diabetes you know those are really great strategies talking about gym for stress relief and and you know we have other products as well that you can use for an additional aid to help you stop smoking have you given any thought to using some type of smoking cessation aid at this time or or what do you think about that patient: you know i've had you know because i've been trying to do cold turkey and it's not working and some of my friends actually have mentioned using a patch and they they've had some success with that so i think i would i would probably wan na start with that","1221":"doctor: okay alright that that sounds good it's good that you've you've picked out one of those aids and have you thought of a quit date i mean we we really wan na talk about when you're gon na say this is the day patient: yeah you know next monday is actually my birthday so i think that's a good day","1222":"doctor: that's a fantastic day and happy birthday coming up on monday patient: thank you","1223":"doctor: so let's talk a little bit about your exam here okay i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam and i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good including your oxygen saturation blood pressure for today was one twenty eight over eighty eight heart rate was sixty eight respirations were sixteen and your pulse ox was ninety eight percent on room air so those were all really good now on your heart exam you do have a nice regular and your your rate is of regular rate and rhythm or i'm sorry your heart exam for your heart exam notice that your heart is regular in rate and rhythm i do however still appreciate that two over six systolic murmur that we talked about in the past now that's okay we'll just continue to monitor that now for your lung exam i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your lungs your lungs are clear and equal bilateral with no expiratory wheezes and no rales or rhonchi are appreciated on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy when i listen i do n't hear any extra noises so i do n't hear any hearing any carotid bruit which is a good thing now for my impression and plan let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem of nicotine dependence first of all i just want to apply you on making this first step to stop smoking and i want you to know with absolute one hundred percent certainty that i'm gon na be with you every step of the way i think it's fantastic that you're very welcome i i i think it's fantastic you've chosen next monday as a quit date and on that day i'm gon na start you with a twenty one milligram nicotine patch and the goal will be to decrease that over time okay now we will work together to decrease that so there is no necessarily hard dates in mind okay be sure to change the patch location each day and that's going to help reduce or avoid that skin irritation that can occur if you use the same location over and over again i would like to see you again in two weeks just to see how things are going and we will reevaluate at that time the dosage for your nicotine patch now we also see further need to discuss any handouts you received today for those common smoking triggers i really want you to keep an eye on and monitor your stress level not only about work but also the fact that you are experiencing are going to be be a new father and we really want to watch any stress you will be experiencing around the birth of your new child so please keep an eye on that and let me know how that goes now for now until we meet in two weeks go ahead and keep up your exercise routine i think that's a great plan and just try to monitor your stress and and maybe think about some things like meditation or adding in some yoga and that type of thing to help further work with your your stress levels so do you have any questions for me patient: no not at this time","1224":"doctor: okay so for your other conditions that we talked about briefly your second condition of type two diabetes we'll let's go ahead and continue to maintain that with diet and exercise and we'll just monitor your type two diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c for your next blood draw since i'll see you in two weeks go ahead and have that done and we will talk about that when you come back in now for your third problem of your history of gout let's go ahead and continue you on your allopurinol and just you know continue to watch those foods that will exacerbate your uric acid levels any other questions about those patient: no i think that's it thanks so much","1225":"doctor: alright sounds good i'll see you in two weeks congratulations on the baby and and we're excited about next monday that's your quit date patient: alrighty thank you","1226":"doctor: you're welcome i'll see you in two weeks thanks bye-bye patient: alright bye","1227":"doctor: good morning julie how are you doing this morning patient: i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you because of this this knee pain that i've been having for about six months now","1228":"doctor: okay and do you remember what caused the pain initially patient: honestly i do n't i ca n't think of anytime if i fell or like i i've really been trying to think and i ca n't really think of any specific event","1229":"doctor: okay now it it says here that it's in both knees is that correct patient: yes both my knees","1230":"doctor: okay it kinda try let's let's try describing the pain for me please patient: yeah it's kind of feels like it's like right behind my kneecaps","1231":"doctor: a deep achy pain okay what kind of activities makes the pain feel worse patient: let's see so anytime so if i'm sitting at my desk and i get up i have a lot of pain so anytime from like standing up from sitting for a while or even going up and down the stairs","1232":"doctor: okay so you work from home patient: i do","1233":"doctor: okay okay so there is a lot of desk setting at home is your office upstairs or is it i mean do you have to go up or downstairs to get to it patient: no well first thing in the morning but otherwise it's downstairs","1234":"doctor: okay okay how do you like working from home patient: you know it has it's plus and minuses","1235":"doctor: and the parking i'm sure the parking is patient: and the parking is great","1236":"doctor: yeah i you know if i could do telehealth visits all day long i would be totally happy with that yeah and just set it home and do those so you mentioned is there anything that makes that pain feel better patient: usually after like if i feel that pain and then i just it does get better","1237":"doctor: okay now you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past what have what are they and did they work at all patient: yeah i've done some ibuprofen or aleve sometimes some tylenol and that does help","1238":"doctor: okay but you're never really pain free is that what i hear you saying patient: not really unless i'm like really just resting which i hate to do but otherwise any type of movement especially from sitting it causes pain","1239":"doctor: okay so are you active other than going up and down the steps to your office patient: very i'm a big runner i love to run i run about five to six miles a day but with this knee with with these knee pain that i've been having it's i barely can even do half a mile","1240":"doctor: yeah you know what that's that's i am a biker and i know that once you get that into your you know you have loved doing that activity it's so frustrating when you ca n't it's almost like a it's almost like a dry it almost becomes a drug when you get up patient: exactly","1241":"doctor: okay so have you noticed any redness or swelling in your knees patient: no","1242":"doctor: okay and have you ever injured your knees before patient: you know despite how active i am i you know i've never","1243":"doctor: okay great so let's go ahead and do a i just wan na take a look here i reviewed your vitals and overall they look good your blood pressure is one twenty over seventy your your heart rate is sixty and your respiratory rate is fourteen those are all phenomenal numbers as i listened to your heart it is at a regular and a slower rate but i do n't hear any extra sounds so there is no murmurs as we go through that now on musculoskeletal exam you have a normal gait i watched you you know kinda walk in here this morning your strength i just wan na check it when i go ahead and i want you to move your leg okay your muscle strength is is good you do have a three out of five for abduction of your legs bilaterally and that's you know kinda bringing your legs in the remainder of your muscle strength for your lower extremities is a five out of five now let me focus specifically on your knee examination i do n't see any redness or ecchymosis or warmth of the skin and those are big words you know i do n't see any bruising or or that redness there is no effusion that's just like a fluid underneath the knee i do n't appreciate that any at all you do seem to have some tenderness when i palpate and you do have a positive patellar grind test when you stood up i could feel that as we went through there you did say you had that knee pain with squatting but your lachman your anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray test are all negative bilaterally neurologically and your your your lower extremities your patella and your achilles reflex are symmetrical and that's good so i did review the x-rays of both your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so based on what you told me and reviewing the mri that you had done before you came in your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a really common condition that we see that causes knee knee pain especially in really active young people that's probably why i do n't get it when i'm riding my bike forever and ever now this condition has to do with the way your kneecap moves across along the groove of your thigh bone your femur so for pain i want you to continue to take the ibuprofen or any other anti-inflammatories you know aleve or any of those as you need it to help with the pain now i am going to recommend physical therapy well they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises this is probably one of the best things that you can do and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you might have do you have any questions for me patient: so will i be able to run again","1244":"doctor: absolutely my goal is to get you out there and maybe we can cross pads on the the bike trail some day you are gon na have to take it a little bit easy for now but we are gon na get you back and once we do that i think you will be really pleased is there anything else patient: no i think that's it","1245":"doctor: okay have a great day patient: okay you too","1246":"doctor: thank you patient: bye","1247":"doctor: hi abigail how are you today patient: hello hi nice to meet you i'm i'm doing okay","1248":"doctor: good i'm doctor sanchez and i'm gon na go ahead and take a look i saw with your notes that you've been having some knee pain yes that's that's true you know it's been going on for a while i like to run i do jogs i sign up for the 5k tack you know sometimes the marathon and i have n't been doing longer distances because patient: when i'm running i my right knee here it just starts to ache and it's it's just to the point where i need your opinion","1249":"doctor: okay okay what have you done for it so far what makes it better what makes it worse patient: well it used to be that when i run it ache and then i put ice on it and then it would be okay so i do ice and ibuprofen","1250":"doctor: okay okay and did you see anybody for this before coming into the office here patient: yeah i doctor wood is my primary care provider and i talked to him about it actually over the years and this last visit he said he referred me to you","1251":"doctor: okay okay good so ice and rest makes it feel better running and and activity makes it hurt a little bit more is that correct patient: yeah that's right","1252":"doctor: okay do you have any family history of arthritis or any of those type of immune diseases patient: i'm trying to think no i do n't think so no","1253":"doctor: okay and do you get is it is this primarily worse in the morning or does it is it just there all the time when it comes on patient: it actually is worse towards the end of the day","1254":"doctor: okay so let's go ahead and i want to do a quick examination here your blood pressure and was one twenty over sixty that's phenomenal your heart rate was fifty eight and you can tell that you're a runner with that that level of a heart rate and your respirations were fourteen so all of that looked very good there was no fever when you came in when i'm gon na just quickly listen to your heart and lungs okay those those sound good but let me get let's focus here on your lower extremities i'm i'm gon na look at your your left knee first when i move your left knee do you get any type of pain or is it just feel like normal and it's always your pain's always isolated to the right patient: that feels that feels normal","1255":"doctor: okay okay so let me i just want you to back up here in the stretcher a little bit more and i'm just gon na do some movement of your knee any okay so i want you to push your leg out against my hand does that hurt patient: no","1256":"doctor: okay and if you pull back does that hurt a little bit patient: no","1257":"doctor: okay and i'm gon na move it around so when i look at the knee there is no redness there's no swelling i can appreciate a a small amount of effusion and that means that there's a little bit of fluid under the knee or in that knee's joint space and there is there is several reasons that could be now when i push on your knee does it hurt more on the inside or does it hurt more on the outside here patient: the the right knee here hurts on the outside","1258":"doctor: okay okay and you've got a good pedal pulse so you know you can feel that and when i touch your feet you do n't have any numbness or tingling or anything like that patient: no uh uh","1259":"doctor: okay well so what i want to tell you is that i think you have a knee sprain from overuse and we see that sometimes in runners now unfortunately you're gon na have to take some a little bit of time off of of active running but i do n't think it will be that long until we can get you up and running again now i reviewed the x-rays that we did when you first came into the office here this morning and the joint spaces of that right knee are are well maintained i do n't see any evidence of any fracture and when compared to the left knee everything looks good so i do n't even see any signs of any arthritis that i would've been suspecting i would like you to stay on two tylenol five hundred milligrams and two ibuprofen two hundred milligram tablets and i want you to take that three times a day and that's gon na help with both the pain and the inflammation i'm also gon na order some physical therapy for your your right knee and that physical therapy will help strengthen the lower extremities and make it give you a little bit of a balance and some they'll be able to recommend good running exercises for you i do wan na follow up with you in two weeks and see if we're getting better so let's no running for two weeks and if we're we're improving then we'll move on and probably start adding some additional activity does that sound like a plan patient: yeah that does i i was curious so i will lay off the running for now can i you know lift weights and do like my squats and and those type of exercises at the gym","1260":"doctor: yeah absolutely and and those are good exercises but i'd like you to get that first physical therapy appointment in and they'll be able to talk with you on what the best exercises are for you to do patient: okay got it","1261":"doctor: any questions patient: hmmm no i do n't think so","1262":"doctor: okay thank you abigail and i'd like i said stop out at the desk and we'll make an appointment for two weeks patient: okay thanks doctor","1263":"doctor: thank you","1264":"doctor: okay so we are recording okay so okay so i understand you've so you've got a past medical history of type two diabetes and you're coming in and for evaluation of a newly diagnosed ovarian cancer so how are you doing today patient: i do n't hear the question but i'm assuming that you when you say batcher so when i start talking about my dog and my three cats and all that those sort of things are not going to be included in the in the note","1265":"doctor: right i want you you can talk about those things yes patient: okay","1266":"doctor: okay so with your newly diagnosed ovarian cancer so how are you feeling today how are you doing patient: i'm doing pretty good depressed","1267":"doctor: little depressed i can understand it's a lot to take on is n't it patient: yes","1268":"doctor: okay okay so lem me ask you some questions so what kind of symptoms were you having that prompted you your doctor to do the tests patient: i was having severe pain and bleeding","1269":"doctor: okay now do you have other symptoms such as weight loss constipation vomiting or issues with urination patient: no vomiting but constipation and weight loss","1270":"doctor: okay yeah that's understandable so do you have any children or have you ever been pregnant patient: i'm sorry i did n't hear that part","1271":"doctor: do you have any children or have you ever been pregnant patient: no to either one of those","1272":"doctor: okay so and do you know at what age you got your period and when you started menopause patient: thirteen for my period and twenty eighth for menopause","1273":"doctor: okay do you take any oral hormone replacement therapy patient: no","1274":"doctor: okay any history of endometriosis patient: any history of what","1275":"doctor: endometriosis patient: no","1276":"doctor: okay how about any family history of any gynecological cancers patient: i was adopted","1277":"doctor: okay okay so i'm just gon na do a quick exam of your abdomen and then perform a vaginal exam okay patient: okay","1278":"doctor: alright okay so i do feel the mass on the where to go here okay patient: i did n't know you're gon na play a doctor today","1279":"doctor: i did okay okay so i do feel the mass on the left side but everything else looks good and on abdominal exam there is slight tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant no rebounding or guarding on vaginal exam there are no external lesions on the labia the vaginal vault is within normal limits the cervix is pink without lesions and on bimanual exam i appreciate a left adnexal mass and there is no masses on the right okay so now i reviewed the results of your abdominal ct which show a three centimeter left ovarian mass with an associated local localized lymph node involvement there is no evidence of gross peritoneal or metastatic disease so lem me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for the first problem so i do think this is most likely ovarian cancer looking at your ct scan it looks like stage three a disease based on the lymph node involvement i want to start by sending off some blood tests like a ca-125 and hcg and afp and ldh these are just tests that help me to determine what type of tumor i'm dealing with and then i want you to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if you have a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer so this stage of ovarian cancer is treated by performing surgery followed by adjunct chemotherapy so this means we'll start chemotherapy after you've recovered from surgery okay so for the surgery i would perform a hysterectomy remove both ovaries and perform a lymph node dissection to remove the involved and involve lymph nodes as well as any other ones i see and i'll also send a sample of any tissue if there anything that looks suspicious at all and we'll be able to tell exactly what stage this is based on the pathology reports i then recommend chemotherapy with cisplatin and taxol and based on how the surgery goes i may want you to receive intraperitoneal intraperitoneal chemo which is done inserting a small tube into your belly for the chemo to go directly into your peritoneum now i know that was a lot sick in do you have any questions or patient: am i gon na die","1280":"doctor: well that's a good question so based on what i see at this time i will we believe you have a favorable diagnosis prognosis and you're also still young and healthy which makes your prognosis even better and we do need to see a final pathology report to give you a definitive answer though okay patient: alright alright","1281":"doctor: hi billy how are you what's been going on the medical assistant told me that you're having some difficulty urinating patient: yeah yeah i i did n't really wan na come in to talk about it's kinda weird but i think probably over the last six months i'm just not peeing right it just does n't seem to be normal","1282":"doctor: okay so let's talk a little bit about that now is your is your stream is your urination stream weak patient: yeah i'd probably say so","1283":"doctor: okay and do you feel like you're emptying your bladder fully or do you feel like you still have some urine left in there when you when you finish patient: most of the times i'm okay but sometimes if i stand there long enough i i can kinda go a little bit more so it's taking a while actually to just go to the bathroom","1284":"doctor: okay and are you waking up at night to go to the bathroom does it impact your sleep patient: yeah i try to empty my bladder now right before i go to bed and and not drink anything but i'm still probably getting up three or four times a night to go to the bed","1285":"doctor: okay so you're getting up about three or four times a night and and how long has this been going on you said for about six months patient: yeah six months to like this and it's probably been a little bit worse over the last six months and maybe it's been longer i just did n't want to bring it up","1286":"doctor: okay so you think it's been going on longer okay alright now how about have you had any burning when you urinate at all patient: no it i do n't think it burns","1287":"doctor: no burning when you urinate okay and and any other any other issues any problems with your bowels any constipation issues patient: hmmm no i i i had diarrhea last week but i think i ate something bad","1288":"doctor: okay and ever have you ever had any issues where you had what we call urinary retention where you could n't pee and you needed to have like a catheter inserted patient: my gosh no","1289":"doctor: alright and have you ever seen a urologist i do n't think so you've been my patient for a while i do n't remember ever sending you but have you ever seen one patient: i do n't think so","1290":"doctor: okay now tell me how are you doing with your with your heart when was the last time you saw doctor moore the cardiologist i know that you had the the stent placed in your right coronary artery about what was that twenty eighteen patient: yeah sounds about right i think i just saw him in november he said everything was okay","1291":"doctor: he said everything was okay alright and so you have n't had any chest pain or shortness of breath you're still walking around doing your activities of daily living are you exercising patient: kind of","1292":"doctor: kind of okay now from what i remember i remember you being a big college football fan are you as excited as i am that georgia beat alabama in the national championships patient: yeah yeah i'm super excited","1293":"doctor: you do n't really seem that excited patient: get the problem fixed because i have to be able to sit there and watch the whole game","1294":"doctor: yeah i i really do n't like nick saving i'm so i'm super happy that that the dogs pulled it out patient: i do n't know if we can do friends anymore","1295":"doctor: are you in alabama fan patient: maybe i'm actually originally not from georgia so","1296":"doctor: okay alright well i mean i i'm i'm a long horns fan but anyway well i digress let's talk a little bit about your diabetes how are how are you doing with your sugars are you watching your diet patient: i'm trying to yeah i think they are okay","1297":"doctor: okay and are you still taking the metformin patient: yep","1298":"doctor: you are okay alright now i wan na go ahead and just move on to a quick physical exam okay i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay alright i do have to do a rectal exam i apologize i'm just gon na be calling it out what what i what i appreciate okay so on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur hurt at the left base on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your abdominal exam your abdomen is nontender and nondistended i do n't appreciate any masses or any rebound or guarding on your prostate exam i do appreciate an enlarged prostate i do n't appreciate any masses on physical exam so what what does that mean billy so that ultimately means that you know everything looks good you know you have that little heart murmur which i believe you you've had in the past but we're gon na go ahead and look into that you know your prostate seems a little bit enlarged to me on physical exam so let's talk about how we can go about and and remedy that okay so for your first problem of this you know difficulty urinating i wan na go ahead and just order some routine labs i wan na get a a psa that kind of that ultimately kinda looks for prostate cancer issues which i do n't think you have because we did n't really appreciate that on physical exam i wan na go ahead and we can try to start you on what we call flomax zero point four milligrams once a day you should take it at night because it can cause people to get a little bit dizzy if they take it in the morning so i would take it at night and i wan na go ahead and refer you to a urologist just to look into this more so we can go ahead and and get this problem solved for you okay i'm also gon na go ahead and just order some routine blood tests just to make sure that we are not missing anything do you have any questions about that and i wan na go ahead and order a urinalysis and a urine culture patient: yeah so sounds good have you seen that commercial for that super batter prostate stuff does that work","1299":"doctor: well i think the data it's it's i'm not really sure if it works or not i'm not that familiar with it let's just go ahead and stick with flomax and that's why we are gon na refer you to the urologist so that they can go ahead and talk to you about you know the most current treatment options for you okay patient: alright","1300":"doctor: alright for your second problem of your coronary artery disease i wan na go ahead and order an echocardiogram just to follow up on that heart murmur that you had and i wan na go ahead and continue you on the lipitor forty milligrams a day and the aspirin and the metoprolol and i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel any questions about that patient: nope","1301":"doctor: okay and then for your third problem of your diabetes it sounds like you're doing really well let's go ahead and continue you on the metformin a thousand milligrams twice a day we will go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c to see if we need to make any adjustments to that and i'm gon na see you again in about three to four weeks okay i want you to call me or message me in the patient portal if you have any concerns patient: alright when is the urologist gon na call me","1302":"doctor: i'm gon na reach out i'm gon na reach out to them now and see if they can get you in this week patient: sounds good","1303":"doctor: okay alright well great it was good to see you bye i could just hit it and i can just talk and then i'm just","1304":"doctor: alright brittany so i see that you are experiencing some right foot pain could you tell me what happened patient: yeah well i was playing tennis and i was trying to you know volley the ball","1305":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: it was like a double game and i was trying to volley the ball and i got in front of another player and actually ended up falling on top of my foot","1306":"doctor: alright patient: and then yeah it kinda hurt i quickly then twisted my myself around her because i was trying to catch myself but then i started to feel some pain in my foot","1307":"doctor: mm-hmm okay have you ever injured that foot before patient: yeah no sorry i injured my other foot before not

what have you been doing for the pain since then patient: i wrapped it after a the game they had some ace wraps in their clubhouse and so i wrapped it up and then i iced it last night and i just kept it up on a pillow and then i took some ibuprofen","1311":"doctor: okay could you one more time when did this injury happen patient: this happened about couple days ago","1312":"doctor: okay so did you say whether does the ibuprofen help at all patient: yeah it helps a little bit but then you know it it you know after a while it wears out","1313":"doctor: okay and then have you experienced any numb numbness or tingling patient: no no numbness","1314":"doctor: okay alright any loss in sensation patient: no i mean i i can still feel like i can still feel my foot","1315":"doctor: okay alright that's good to hear so you were playing tennis is that what you normally do to work out patient: i do i'm trying to learn but i can not afford tennis less lessons so me and my friends just hit the balls back and forth i do sleep","1316":"doctor: i love it absolutely yeah my dad one time took me to play racquet ball and i learned the very bruisy way that that was n't for me yeah patient: that scares me","1317":"doctor: it's it they they move pretty fast i'm not gon na lie alright so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my my physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings but if you have any questions go ahead stop me let me know but i will be explaining along the way okay patient: okay","1318":"doctor: alright so i've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great you know your blood pressure i see is one twenty five over seventy that's almost textbook respiratory rate we are seeing you at a smooth eighteen excuse me your temperature you're running normal ninety seven . one you're you're satting at a hundred percent so and then your pulse so that's interesting like you're you're going at like about sixty beats a minute so i think they're i think we're doing pretty well i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop we have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam i do appreciate a little bit of stridor that's really interesting but i do n't hear any wheezes or rales so that's great for your i know this sounds weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt patient: no uh uh","1319":"doctor: okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions patient: yeah do i have to do the surgery","1320":"doctor: so i'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot if you do n't it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flat-footed you can also develop arthritis in that foot so yes i i i highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with patient: i just hate that word surgery doc","1321":"doctor: so it's actually patient: have to be in the hospital","1322":"doctor: no no no no no it's actually a day surgery and you'll be able to go home the same day and then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week you'll be in a cast and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do so the procedure itself is not very long you will and so like since you will be able to go home that's great but you wo n't be able to drive especially since you're saying are you left handed or right handed patient: i'm right handed","1323":"doctor: yeah so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with so no you're gon na you're gon na need somebody to take you home but what patient: i mean","1324":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: i really wan na keep on playing my tennis with my friends but","1325":"doctor: yeah so unfortunately yes it does mean that you're out for the rest of the season but hopefully we can get you a great get you to a set up well for next season and in the meantime i think i'm gon na recommend after surgery that we get you to physical therapy i think that that's gon na be a really great way to like kinda strengthen the muscles and make sure that you're at peak performance before we put you back out there patient: i suppose so","1326":"doctor: alright patient: thank you","1327":"doctor: no problem so i do wan na let you know that there are some risks associated with any kind of surgical procedure i'm gon na bring you some paperwork and that my ma is gon na go over with you such as like risks of bleeding loss of sensation nerve damage all those things will be discussed with you and if you have any questions leading up to and even after your procedure go ahead and ask them and we'll be more than happy to help with that okay patient: okay","1328":"doctor: alright patient: good","1329":"doctor: thank you patient: thank you","1330":"doctor: hey linda good to see you today so looking here in my notes looks like you you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on patient: and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago","1331":"doctor: okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go patient: it's constant","1332":"doctor: alright are you able to urinate patient: i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood","1333":"doctor: okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes patient: i've had it for probably this might be my third time","1334":"doctor: third time alright patient: yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time","1335":"doctor: okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever patient: no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous","1336":"doctor: okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain patient: yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working","1337":"doctor: okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved patient: yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah","1338":"doctor: right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day patient: yeah","1339":"doctor: so we are getting close there patient: okay","1340":"doctor: yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff patient: i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff","1341":"doctor: so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running patient: like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty","1342":"doctor: okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the the one eighties which was really high patient: right","1343":"doctor: so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that patient: trying my best but doc i really like my french fries","1344":"doctor: we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help patient: yeah some help could be helpful","1345":"doctor: okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright. so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday patient: i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds","1346":"doctor: okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday patient: i do","1347":"doctor: that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain patient: no chest pain","1348":"doctor: no chest pain are you having any belly pain patient: the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain","1349":"doctor: no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt patient: yes","1350":"doctor: okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful patient: yes","1351":"doctor: alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound patient: that sounds good and i i just i just want this pain to go away so thank you","1352":"doctor: okay no problem","1353":"doctor: hey mason good to see you today so let's see you here in my notes for evaluation of kidney stones your your pcp said you had some kidney stones so you got a referral over so can you tell me a little bit about that you know what happened when did you first notice them patient: yeah it was about you know about a week ago and i was working down in the the barn with the horses and you know i was moving some hay but i developed this real sudden onset of pain in my right back and i thought it initially it was from throwing hay but it i broke out into a sweat i got real nauseated and that's when i went and saw my doctor and he ordered a cat scan and said that i had a kidney stone but you know that's i i've never had that before my father's had them in the past but yeah so that's that's how that all happened","1354":"doctor: okay so you said you had the pain on the right hand side does it move anywhere or radiate patient: well when i had it it would it radiated almost down to my groin","1355":"doctor: okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go patient: well when i you know after i found out i had a disk a kidney stone it came a couple times but it did n't last as long no i've been i've been straining my urine they told me to pee in this little cup","1356":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: and i've been straining my urine and you know i do n't see anything in there","1357":"doctor: okay have you noticed any blood in your urine i know you've been draining probably take a good look at it has it been darker than usual patient: no not really not really darker","1358":"doctor: okay so have you had kidney stones before and then you said your father had them but patient: i've never had a kidney stone my dad had them a lot but i've never had one","1359":"doctor: okay alright so let me do a quick exam of you your vital signs look good i do n't see any fever or your blood pressure and heart rate are fine so let me do a quick physical exam let me press here on your belly so on your examination of your abdomen there is no tenderness to to pain to palpation of the abdomen there is no rebound or guarding there is cva there is tenderness on the right side so that means patient: i have a stroke","1360":"doctor: can you repeat that patient: i did i have a stroke","1361":"doctor: no no no no no so that means like everything is normal right but i feel like you you you have some tenderness and inflammation over your kidney so that has to be expected because you do have a kidney stone so i did review the results of your ct and it does show a stone that's measuring point five centimeters located in the proximal right ureter and that's that duct that classes from your your kidney to down to your bladder there is no evidence of hydronephrosis that would mean that the stone is obstruct obstructing the ureter causing swelling in the kidney so there is there is no evidence of that so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone so right now i'm gon na recommend that we we have you push fluids just to help facilitate you urinating and passing the stone i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours for pain and you can continue to take tylenol between that for any breakthrough pain and you already have a strainer so that's good continue to use that and we can see continue that until the stone hasses and i'm also gon na order a bmp and your urinalysis and urine culture just to make sure that everything else is okay with you and based on urinalysis we can see if we need to prescribe you antibiotics see if you have any type of infection i do want to see you back in about one to two weeks and hopefully by that time you you passed the stone but if not we can discuss further treatment lithotripsy it's like a shock wave kinda breaks up that stone it's not it's not that invasive procedure but we can just we can discuss that if it has n't passed in that one to two weeks that sound good patient: that sounds perfect dear too","1362":"doctor: alright patient: thank you document","1363":"doctor: so i will see you in a week or so and hopefully you've passed that stone and i'll send my nurse in with that prescription patient: okay thank you","1364":"doctor: thanks","1365":"doctor: hi jeremy how are you patient: i'm really good thank you how are you","1366":"doctor: i'm okay the the medical assistant told me that you had this ulcer on your foot that's been there for a couple of weeks patient: yes","1367":"doctor: going away patient: yeah it's been there gosh it's like six or so weeks right now and it's and it's on my right foot and it's just yeah it's just not going away i'm not sure if it maybe even gotten a little worse from when i first noticed it","1368":"doctor: okay and how long did you say it's going on for patient: probably about","1369":"doctor: six eight weeks maybe patient: okay and do you have any pain in your foot no no no pain at all okay now i know that you're a diabetic and you are on some insulin have your sugars been running okay yeah they have been running","1370":"doctor: your sugars are running higher than normal okay do you recall what your last hemoglobin a1c was was it above nine patient: yes it it it definitely was higher than nine","1371":"doctor: okay alright now what do you think caused this ulcer were you wearing some tight fitting shoes or did you have some trauma to your foot or patient: yeah i was you know i think initially i'm you know i was out in the backyard you know kind of you know doing some work and you know i know i you know i could've stepped on a nail or you know there was some other work but you know i'm always outside so i do n't know if that kind of led to anything or caused anything","1372":"doctor: okay alright and have you had any fever or chills patient: no no no fever or chills you know i kinda you know get headaches pretty often i do n't know if that you know i do n't know if that's a stress or but you know always have like the tension headaches in the front","1373":"doctor: okay and do you have do you have neuropathy where you get like numbing and tingling in your feet patient: occasionally yeah occasionally especially when it's like colder outside","1374":"doctor: mm-hmm kinda feels like it takes a little longer to patient: warm up but yeah i kinda have some sensation in in all my extremities","1375":"doctor: okay alright and then are you are you a smoker or did you smoke patient: i did back you know kind of years ago i did but yeah i have n't smoked anything in in good number of years","1376":"doctor: okay alright when did you stop smoking patient: couple years ago maybe four or so years ago","1377":"doctor: okay alright and how many packs a day would you smoke patient: gosh back then yeah was at least two","1378":"doctor: okay alright how many years did you smoke for like twenty patient: yeah at least twenty yeah twenty plus years","1379":"doctor: okay alright now any other symptoms do you have any problems when you walk down the street do you get any pain in your calves at all when you walk patient: no no no no pain you know just kind of you know it's just i know that it's there","1380":"doctor: okay and you said you're active you're out in the yard and things like that do you go on long walks at all or no patient: no no you know it's you know i just kinda feel like i've been just trying to take it easy lately","1381":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: but yeah most most of the stuff i've been doing is just kind of hanging around the house","1382":"doctor: okay alright so we talked a little bit about your diabetes let's talk about your heart disease now your heart disease you had a heart attack in twenty eighteen we put a stent into your right coronary artery you're still taking your medications for that you're still on your aspirin patient: i am yes yeah i do the baby aspirin every day","1383":"doctor: okay alright and any chest pain or shortness of breath or anything like that no no yeah no nothing more than yeah i would n't attribute anything patient: okay and do you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams","1384":"doctor: no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here patient: no","1385":"doctor: there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help patient: any questions","1386":"doctor: yeah i mean is this do we have to do any more tests or anything what are you we're gon na do an arterial ultrasound i'm going to go ahead and order an arterial ultrasound of your lower extremities to see what the blood supply is like and then i'm gon na go ahead and order a podiatry consult because i want them to see this wound and improve the wound care that you're doing and then for your next problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and talk to your primary care physician we need to get your diabetes better controlled because that impacts your wound healing as well okay patient: sure","1387":"doctor: sure understood alright and for your last issue your coronary artery disease continue with your statin and i will talk to your cardiologist in case you need a procedure to see if you're cleared from a medical standpoint okay patient: okay perfect","1388":"doctor: alright patient: perfect thank you so much","1389":"doctor: okay bye","1390":"doctor: so anna good to see you today so reading here in your appointment notes you were you were diagnosed with kidney stones from your your pcp and you currently have one and so they they had you come in so can you tell me what happened how's all that going for you patient: sure i've been having some back pain on my right side it's been lasting for about a week now","1391":"doctor: okay so on the right side so does that pain does it move anywhere or is it just kinda stay in that that one area patient: yeah it's moved down a little bit on to my right lower side a little bit","1392":"doctor: side okay so how would you describe the pain is it constant or is does it come and go patient: it's pretty constant","1393":"doctor: okay did you notice any pain when you're urinating i know i know you say you you saw you see blood but any pain with that patient: no no real pain when i'm when i'm peeing at all","1394":"doctor: okay so have you taken anything i know have you tried like azo or any of that to patient: i took some ibuprofen that helped a little bit","1395":"doctor: alright have you noticed any nausea vomiting fever chills patient: i have n't thrown up but i felt a little bit nauseated","1396":"doctor: little nauseated yeah that's we expected so have you do you have a family history of kidney stones i know some people when they have them like their parents have them stuff but patient: yeah my my dad had kidney stones i think he has passed a couple of them i'm not quite sure","1397":"doctor: alright and have you had any in the past or is this your first one patient: this is my first time i've never had this before","1398":"doctor: okay alright so we'll do we'll do an exam on you just to check you out so i guess you were in pain and stuff over the over the easter easter break there that patient: yeah yeah i had some pain over the weekend i saw my pediatrician this morning so they sent me over here they were concerned that i might have a kidney stone","1399":"doctor: okay so i'm guessing you did n't get to go find the eggs on the easter egg hunt because of the you were in pain patient: not so much but i i got to participate a little bit i opened some eggs i just did n't go run around and find them","1400":"doctor: okay well i i'm lucky enough my friends had an adult easter hag hunt for me and so i was able to find a couple eggs yesterday myself so i i'm glad you were able to get a few of them alright so let's do that that physical exam on you so your vitals look good you do n't have any fever your blood pressure heart rate is fine so when i press here on your belly does that hurt patient: a little bit yeah","1401":"doctor: a little bit alright so on your exam of your abdomen there is mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there's no rebound or guarding there is cva located near your flank tenderness on the right so that means that everything looks good but you do have what seems to be some inflammation of your kidney okay so we we were able to get a ct of your your side and it showed that you do have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size and it's located in the proximal right ureter and so that's that duck that passes from your kidney to your bladder alright i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so that means that there's not obstructing ureter causing swelling in your kidney which is which is pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone on the right so what i'm recommending is i want you to push fluids just to help facilitate you passing that stone alright have you been taking in have you been drinking enough water do you think so far patient: probably not enough i drink some but","1402":"doctor: okay yeah i i want you to to drink try drink as much as possible just to see if we can get you hydrated and pass the stone what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na prescribe you ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you can take that as needed for pain i know you said you were in that much pain just in case it does start to move you're in pain i want you to take the ibuprofen i'm also gon na give you a strainer for you to strain your pee so we can see you wan na know when that that stone does pass gon na order a bmp and a urinalysis and a urine culture and based on what the urinalysis shows we can decide if i can decide if i need to put you on antibiotics if you do have an infection of some kind and i wan na see you back in about a week to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we can discuss further treatment such as a lithotripsy and it's it's a mainly minimally invasive procedure where we use shock waves to try to break up that stone but otherwise do you have any other questions for me patient: no i do n't think so","1403":"doctor: alright so we will see you back in a week or two and i'll have my nurse come in with that prescription and hopefully with all the treatment you'll be able to pass the stone okay alright","1404":"doctor: so barbara i i know you are here for some itchy scalp pain can you tell me a little bit about how you're doing patient: yeah it's still quite a problem you know something i've been suffering with for so long now it's still quite itchy and it's really embarrassing too because i'll have dandruff so much like all over me but but i just ca n't stop itching","1405":"doctor: okay when did you first notice this patient: i wan na say it's been a while but probably worsening in the past like six months or so","1406":"doctor: okay okay and have you seen ever noticed any rashes either when it first started or intermittently anywhere else patient: on my body no not really","1407":"doctor: okay okay just mainly up underneath your on your scalp there uh and i can i can see that man that looks really itchy and scaly have you died your hair recently or used any other chemicals you you know like a new hair spray or gel patient: nothing new i mean i do dye my hair but i've been doing that for years now but otherwise i do n't really use a lot of products in my hair","1408":"doctor: yeah i you know it's funny you say that because i keep saying i earned this gray hair and i'm gon na keep it so yeah have you tried any over the counter treatments i know there is a lot out of there something you know like a t gel or any of those other have those helped patient: yeah i did that i did head and shoulders i even tried some castor oil and but none of them really seemed to be helping","1409":"doctor: okay okay let's talk about some other symptoms any joint pain fever weight loss patient: not that i can recall i've been pretty good otherwise","1410":"doctor: okay good and going back you know to your grandparents has anybody else in the family had similar symptoms that you're aware of patient: no well maybe my sister","1411":"doctor: maybe your sister okay patient: yeah maybe my sister i mean i know she'll is no one has as bad as i do but she does report like just having a dry scalp","1412":"doctor: okay okay now you know a lot of times we can see this with you know high levels of stress has there been any new mental or emotional stressors at work or at home patient: not really i mean it's basically the same things","1413":"doctor: okay yeah i yeah we have a lot of that yes so let me go ahead and and look at this a little closer here the first off i wan na tell you the the vital signs that the my assistant took when you came in your blood pressure is one thirty over sixty eight your heart rate was ninety eight and your respiratory rate was eighteen so those all look good and appear normal and your temperature was ninety seven . seven and that is all normal now when i look at your scalp here i do notice that you have demarcated scaly erythematous plaques and that's just kind of explaining technically what's going on those patches and they're they're in a patchy format they're diffusely present across the back of your skull and that's probably why you you see all that that that white dander you know on your on your your clothes as you go through the day now lem me talk a little bit about my impression and plan i think that you have a scalp psoriasis and let's and here is my thoughts on that what i would like you to use is to use clobetasol that's a zero . zero five percent solution and i want you to use that twice daily on the the affected areas of your scalp so you're just gon na put this on and just kinda gently rub it in now i know to do it twice daily is going to be difficult but if you can do it first thing in the morning when you get up and then before you go to bed you know get a shower and before you go to bed that will be great i want you to continue to use t-gel shampoo that you listed when you first came in that's a very good solution shampoo for that and that will help with controlling a lot of this now there is no cure for this unfortunately and flareups can be unpredictable but we see that you know not a we do n't have a great finger on what causes the flare ups but i'm gon na give you some steroids that will help and we're gon na have to manage that on a ongoing basis but when you get do get a flare up i want you to be using these flare steroid that i give you as we go through that and then i wan na see you back here in three months or sooner if it gets significantly worse do you have any questions for me patient: no okay so i'll just use that steroid solution and then just as needed if it's really bad but then otherwise just use the t gel","1414":"doctor: yeah i want it's exactly what i want you to do i want you to use that that solution twice daily when you get that flare but then other than that just continue to use that t-gel shampoo patient: alright","1415":"doctor: okay i'm gon na have my nurse come in and get you discharged but i the we will see you again in three months or and again please if it gets worse please do n't hesitate to call me and come in sooner patient: alright perfect thank you","1416":"doctor: thank you patient: okay bye","1417":"doctor: hey elijah how are you patient: i'm doing okay","1418":"doctor: so i see here that your primary care provider sent you over it looks like you were doing some yard work yesterday and dropped a landscape brick on your foot can what so what's going on with your right foot today patient: it's a little sore today but you know i hurt my foot before but this is the first time where i'm actually being seen for it","1419":"doctor: okay so you say you've injured your right foot before tell me a little bit about that injury patient: twenty years ago i broke my ankle i had to put in a cast but that seems to be okay but you know sometimes it'll give me trouble once in a while it feels a little sore it swells up at times","1420":"doctor: okay alright so when you dropped that brick on your foot were you able to get up and keep working or did you have to get off your you know not stop weightbearing and and get off that foot can you tell me a little bit about after the traumatic incident patient: i you know it was a little sore i called a few names you know god damn why is this in my foot but you know i kept working putting it around a little bit but now it's got swollen so i got to see my doctor he told me i had to go see you here i am so tell me what's going on with it","1421":"doctor: so what have you been doing for the pain since the initial insult patient: lucken it up","1422":"doctor: okay have you taken any medications safe for example tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain patient: no i feel like taking the medicine","1423":"doctor: okay and then just out of curiosity you said you were doing some landscaping have you been over to landscapes warehouse new here in town my wife and i were just over there this last weekend and picked up a whole bunch of stuff you had a chance to make it over there yet patient: no not yet i heard about it though i might have to make a trip once my foot heals","1424":"doctor: alright that sounds good now just out of curiosity can you rate your pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life patient: eleven out of ten","1425":"doctor: okay and then have you experienced any numbness or tingling of that foot since the incident patient: yeah the whole foot is numb","1426":"doctor: okay i'm gon na do a quick physical exam now your vitals look good and i would like to do a focused exam of your right foot the there is some bruising on the bottom part of your foot and on the top part as well and i do appreciate the associated swelling and i also recognize that you do have tenderness to palpation for midfoot now for your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is brisk in less than three seconds i do note a strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse with motor and sensation is intact for that foot i also like to call out the fact that it matches bilaterally which is important i'm gon na go ahead and review the diagnostic imaging results so we did a x-ray of that right foot and i do notice dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to your second metatarsal bone and the top of your foot this is where the metatarsals meet those cuboids okay so it where the bones come together in your foot now there are a lot of ligaments in your foot so i do want to order an mri just to assess if there is any injuries to those ligaments now based on your exam and looking at the x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery now the reason why this is important is if we have poor bone alignment or ligament healing you can this can lead to losing the arch in your foot you could becoming flat-footed and also developing arthritis now what's gon na be key here is the surgery is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly we are going to put them back into place using plates and screws now the key thing is going to be it's going to be outpatient surgery so it's going to be same day i'll see you in the morning and then you'll be discharged home that evening and we will do a follow-up i wan na see you in twenty four hours post procedure but then i'll see you again in two weeks you're gon na be in a cast and i'm gon na have you use crutches you're not gon na be able to weight-bear on that foot for six to eight weeks what we'll do is we'll advance your ambulating gradually based on how you heal and based on how you tolerate the procedure i know i have covered a lot of material quickly but this is really gon na be the best course of action for you to have a good outcome now do you have any questions come answers concerns before i have the nurse come in finish the paperwork and get you set up for your procedure which we are going to do tomorrow if you're agreeable to that patient: what about putting in a cast can i just stay in the cast","1427":"doctor: you could but what we found is the best outcome is aligning those bones with plates and screws to make sure that they heal properly so you have the best outcome possible patient: so if the surgery is going to be tomorrow when am i going to get my mri","1428":"doctor: so what what we will do is the good news is we have an outpatient mri facility downstairs and i'm going to send the order down and we'll get you your mri this afternoon patient: can i think about it and we have some time","1429":"doctor: alright thanks elijah","1430":"doctor: karen nelson is a 3 -year-old female with no significant past medical history who comes in for evaluation of a new right eye twitch karen is accompanied by her father hi karen

dad tell me does the karen seem bothered or any other and have any other issues when this happens patient: no i mean when it happens she just continues playing or doing whatever she was doing when it happens","1442":"doctor: okay alright has she has she otherwise been feeling okay since this started has she been acting normally patient: i i'd say she seems fine i mean she has been eating well and playing with her friends and she goes about her normal activities really","1443":"doctor: okay good patient: never even though anything was going on","1444":"doctor: okay alright good so has has karen had any seizures in the past patient: no","1445":"doctor: no okay and then so tell me when the twitch occurs do you ever notice any you know parts of her like moving or twitching patient: well no uh it's just her face","1446":"doctor: okay okay yeah that would be great to see that because i wan na see what's going on so thank you for that tell me is there any family history of seizures or like tourette's syndrome patient: well no history of seizures but i i i never heard of that tourette thing","1447":"doctor: yeah so so toret is that it's a nervous system disorder that you know involves like repetitive movements or like unwanted sounds and it typically begins in childhood and i do n't know have you noticed anything like that with her when she was younger patient: really i had nobody in our family got anything like that","1448":"doctor: okay now tell me have you noticed any other symptoms how about like fever or chills patient: no","1449":"doctor: okay coughing headache patient: ma'am","1450":"doctor: okay how about any problems with karen's sleep patient: nope","1451":"doctor: okay okay good let's go ahead and do physical exam on karen here alright karen i'm just gon na take a look at you and and ask you to follow some commands okay patient: okay","1452":"doctor: alright can you follow my finger with your eyes good now can you do me a favor walk across the room for me great job okay now i want you to close your eyes and reach out your arms in front of you good now keep your eyes closed can you feel me touch you here how about okay how about there patient: mm-hmm","1453":"doctor: does that feel the same patient: yeah","1454":"doctor: okay alright so i'm just gon na check your reflexes okay alright now on your on the neurological exam the patient is awake alert and oriented times three speech is clear and fluent gait is steady heel toe walking is normal and the cranial nerves are intact without focal neurologic findings there is no pronator drift sensation is intact reflexes are two plus and symmetric at the biceps triceps knees and ankles so this means everything looks good karen patient: that's great","1455":"doctor: good alright so i'm gon na go ahead and tell you what we're gon na do so i'm gon na tell you my assessment and plan here so dad so for the first problem i do believe that karen does have a tick eye tics are very common in children and as many as you know one in five children have a tick during their school years and tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging facial grimacing sniffling excessive throat clearing and uncontrolled vocalization i can say that essentially they're brief sudden and involuntary motor movements now we do n't have a full understanding of the cause of the tics but they typically occur around five to ten years of age but most ticks go away on their own and they disappear within a year so these are what we call transient tics and the best thing to do is ignore the tics so it does n't seem to be bothering karen and she seems to be doing well in school and activities so it may wax and wane over time but you might notice it more towards the end of the day when the child is tired so you may also you know see it if they're stressed so that's why it's important to just ignore it now when you draw attention to the tick it does make the child conscious so that can make the tic worse so we want to be careful again just to to kind of not to draw too much attention on it and do you have any questions for me patient: so you mean you're telling me you do n't think he had a seizure or a bit or nothing","1456":"doctor: yeah i do n't think it's i do n't think so because it's it is the same part of her body that's moving every time that and she reports that it's somewhat of an there is an urge to blink her eye and some relief afterwards patient: so you're not recommending any kind of treatment there is no pill or cream or nothing","1457":"doctor: not at this time because she seems to be doing well overall and the tic has n't impacted her school or her activities but if it worsens then we can consider some treatment okay patient: alright alright sounds good","1458":"doctor: alright thank you you guys have a good day patient: doctor","1459":"doctor: bye karen","1460":"doctor: alright thanks for coming in today i see on my chart here that you had a bunch of lower respiratory infections so first tell me how are you what's going on patient: you know i'm doing better now but you know last week i was really sick and i just have had enough like i was coughing a lot a lot of mucus even had some shortness of breath and even a low-grade fever","1461":"doctor: wow that is a lot so what did you do for some of those symptoms patient: you know i ended up drinking a lot of fluid and taking some robitussin and i actually got better over the weekend and now i'm feeling much better but what concerns me is that i i tend to get pneumonia a lot","1462":"doctor: okay so when you say a lot like how frequently does it occur patient: i would say it seem honestly it seems like it's every month or every other month especially over the past six six months that i just keep getting sick and i usually will end up having to go to my primary care doctor or patient urgent care and i'll get prescribed some antibiotics and one time i actually ended up in the emergency room","1463":"doctor: wow and how long do your symptoms normally last for patient: you know it could be as few as like a couple of days but sometimes it could go even up to a week","1464":"doctor: mm-hmm you mentioned that you are a farmer did you do you notice that your symptoms occur while doing certain things on the farm patient: you know i was trying to think about that and i've been working on the farm for some time but the only thing i can think about is that i've been helping my brother out and i've been started like unloading a lot of hay which i do n't usually do and i wan na say that my symptoms actually start the days that i'm unloading hay","1465":"doctor: alright do you wear a mask when you're unloading hay patient: no i do n't do that","1466":"doctor: okay yeah so like that your brother does n't either patient: no i'm the only one who seems to be getting sick","1467":"doctor: alright so i know you said you were trying to like help out your brother like what's going on with him patient: you know we've just been getting really busy and so he has been working around doing other things so i've just been helping him just cover the extra load","1468":"doctor: mm-hmm okay alright do you have any other siblings patient: yeah there is actually ten of us","1469":"doctor: wow okay that's that's a lot of siblings patient: yeah i'm okay","1470":"doctor: maybe maybe we could we could always stick them in they could get some work done the holidays must be fun at your place patient: yeah we do n't need to hire any i mean have anyone else this is our family","1471":"doctor: you're right keep it in the family okay so speaking of family do you have do you or anyone have a history of seasonal allergies patient: no no i have never had any problems with allergies","1472":"doctor: okay and do you smoke patient: i do n't smoke","1473":"doctor: do you live with anybody who does patient: i do not","1474":"doctor: okay alright so okay so now i i wan na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out some of my findings just to make sure that i'm documenting everything and if you have any questions about what it is that i'm saying please feel free to ask okay patient: okay","1475":"doctor: so i reviewed your vitals and you appear to be breathing a little fast your respiratory rate is twenty but but your oxygen is you're satting kind of fine at ninety nine percent on room air so i'm not too worried about that on for on your heart exam i do you have a regular rate and regular rhythm i do not appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops on your lung exam you know i do you do have some fine rales on your lung exam but no wheezes and on your musculoskeletal exam i do not appreciate any clubbing of your fingers so for your results i did review the results of your chest x-ray and i noticed some round glass opacities so let me tell you a little bit about like my assessment and plan for your first problem of recurrent lung infections your symptoms seem consistent with a condition we call hypersensitivity pneumonitis in your case another name is farmer's lung which you know is appropriate considering your job this could be caused by bacteria and or mold that is found in the hay when you inhale it it leads to an allergic reaction in your lungs this is why your symptoms occur every time you move hay for your current symptoms i'm gon na prescribe you a a course of an oral steroid this will help to decrease the inflammation that is occurring in your lungs i will also be ordering a cat scan of your lungs which will help confirm the diagnosis as as well a pulmonary function test to assess how severe your respiratory impairment is it would be best if you could eliminate your exposure to the hay or prevent further to prevent further damage to your lungs however if you are unable it's very important that you wear a respirator when moving hay around i know that that was a lot of information i think it boils down to pull in more of your siblings to help work around but do you have any questions patient: yeah so is this gon na help so i do n't keep getting sick","1476":"doctor: so ideally what we are doing i think this is the best course of action to deal with the deeper problem right of these infections and to kind of like clear up the pneumonia everything seems to hint on so what we're gon na do is treat your current infection we're going to either prevent you from being around hay or make it so that it's safe for you to be with hay and then we're gon na see like what we need to do moving forward does that help patient: okay it does","1477":"doctor: alright patient: thank you","1478":"doctor: okay no problem patient: alright","1479":"doctor: hi good afternoon joseph how are you doing today patient: i'm doing well but my my big toe hurts and it's a little red too but it really hurts okay how long has this been going on i would say you know off and on for about two weeks but last week is is when it really became painful i was at a a trade show convention and i could n't walk the halls i could n't do anything i just had to stand there and it really hurt the whole time i was there","1480":"doctor: okay does it throb ache burn what kind of pain do you get with it patient: it's almost like a throbbing pain but occasionally it becomes almost like a a sharp stabbing pain especially if i move it or spend too much time walking i i find myself walking on my heel just to keep that toe from bending","1481":"doctor: okay sorry i got a text and patient: well that's okay you know what i i you know i what i really you know i love to ride bikes have you you ride bike at all","1482":"doctor: no i hate riding a bike i'm more of a runner patient: my gosh i love to ride i ride the lot of rails the trails i mean i go all the last year i put in over eight hundred miles on rails the trails","1483":"doctor: yeah those those are nice patient: yeah","1484":"doctor: does it does riding your bike bother your big toe patient: no because i i kinda pedal with the the back of my feet you know on that side","1485":"doctor: okay do do you wear clips or are you just wearing a regular shoe and on a regular pedal patient: i'm on a regular shoe some most of the time i'm in my flip flops","1486":"doctor: okay okay the how is there anything that you were doing out of the ordinary when this started patient: no i do n't that's the thing i do n't remember an injury if it was something that i injured i think i would have just ignored it and would n't have showed up here but when it got red and warm to touch that's when i i was really concerned","1487":"doctor: okay do does even light pressure to it bother it like at night when you're laying in bed do the sheets bother patient: absolutely i was just gon na say when i'm in bed at night and those sheets come down on it or i roll over yeah that hurts a lot","1488":"doctor: okay have you done anything to try to get it to feel better any soaks or taking any medicine patient: i take you know like a two ibuprofen a day and that does n't seem to help","1489":"doctor: let me see your your foot here and let me take your big toe through a range of motion if i push your top to bottom patient: yeah ouch","1490":"doctor: big toe joint that okay and let me move it up where as i bend it up does that hurt patient: it hurts but not as much as when you moved it down","1491":"doctor: okay so i'm moving it down here and it i've got about ten degrees of plantar flexion does that hurt patient: yeah it a little when you take it a little further","1492":"doctor: if i go a little bit further to twenty degrees does that hurt patient: that hurts more yeah","1493":"doctor: okay if i push in on your big toe and move it back and forth does that hurt patient: yes it does and it it's almost like those joints that when you push it back it's almost like it's grinding a little bit too","1494":"doctor: okay if i push in between your big toe and your second toe here does that hurt patient: a little bit but not terrible","1495":"doctor: okay what about if i push on the other side here patient: yeah yeah right there on the outside of it absolutely","1496":"doctor: okay and i'm feeling a little bit of bone spur here as well let me let me get an x-ray patient: okay","1497":"doctor: and after we take a peek at that we'll develop a plan patient: okay","1498":"doctor: so at this point what would i do if i'm going out of the room and then coming back patient: you could hit pause or hit the stop button and just restart it the next time you come in","1499":"doctor: okay alrighty so taking a look at your x-ray and you do have you you have a large spur there on the top of your big toe joint patient: oh","1500":"doctor: and you've lost a lot of the cartilage patient: oh","1501":"doctor: and so you you've got some arthritis in there we we call this hallux rigidus and treatment for this to start off with we we put an insert in your shoe called an orthotic and we give you a little bit of anti-inflammatory medication or like a drug called meloxicam you only have to take it once a day patient: okay","1502":"doctor: it's usually pretty well tolerated have you ever had any trouble with your stomach patient: no never never had any problems with my stomach i love the i love the mexican's food the hotter the better so i hope i never get a problem with my stomach","1503":"doctor: i hope you do n't either one of the things that we get concerned about with an anti-inflammatory like that is that it can irritate the stomach so if you do start to notice that you're getting heartburn or pain right there patient: yeah","1504":"doctor: below your your sternum you would need to stop taking the medicine and give me a call patient: okay","1505":"doctor: and i wan na see you back in two weeks to see how you're doing with that if you're not seeing significant improvement then we may have to talk about doing things that are a little more invasive like doing a shot patient: okay","1506":"doctor: or even surgery to clean out the joint sometimes patient: is that surgery","1507":"doctor: i have to patient: would that be","1508":"doctor: i'm sorry patient: would that be surgery clean out the joint","1509":"doctor: yeah that would patient: okay","1510":"doctor: that would be surgery if if we went in and cleaned out the joint sometimes in really severe cases we even just have to fuse the big toe joint we put it in a position of optimal function and we fuse it there and then your pain goes away you lose some motion but you've already lost quite a bit of motion and and the pain goes away so that that surgery really is very effective but let's try to run from my knife a little bit longer patient: okay well you know i do n't think i'm gon na be able to do my work job i'm on my feet every day and i it's and and quite frankly it's fishing season so do you think you can give me a couple weeks off so i can get out and get some fishing done","1511":"doctor: no i want you to be doing your regular activities i want to know how this because if i put you out of work can you come back in and say it feels better well is was it because of the treatment or because of the rest so no i want you to keep working i want you to do your regular activities and i really want you to put these orthotics to the test and this medicine to the test and we will see how you're doing in two weeks patient: okay where i really like catching blue going croppy so okay we'll we'll i'll i'll keep working then i'll find time to do that later","1512":"doctor: very good we will see you in two weeks patient: okay thank you","1513":"doctor: russell ramirez is a 45 -year-old male with past medical

legs if i'm not careful","1524":"doctor: there is a lot of salt and pizza and you know and you're gon na have to be able to avoid all the other salty foods as well so and i know that's hard but it's very important for your heart to be able to function at it's best right and you wan na be able to get out and walk you know walk take those walks again at the park and then you know do your photography so in order to do that we're gon na have to really cut back on those okay patient: well","1525":"doctor: alright so why do n't we go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here i just want to take a look at you your vital signs look good i'm glad to see you're tolerating the medication well i'm gon na go ahead and feel your neck here i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention and there are no carotid bruits on your heart exam there is a three out of six six systolic ejection murmur it's heard at the left base but that's pretty much the same as last year so we'll

sinus rhythm good r wave progression and evolutionary changes which are anticipated so let's go ahead and talk about my assessment plan for you for your first diagnosis of coronary artery disease we are gon na have you continue your your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily and we're gon na have you continue on that high dose statin that atorvastatin you might call it lipitor eighty milligrams daily and then also continue on that toprol fifty milligrams daily okay and i'm also going to refer you to cardiac rehab so for you to get some education about your heart and also give you the confidence to get back exercising regularly now i know patients love the cardiac rehab program i think you will do well does that sound good to you patient: that sounds good document","1526":"doctor: alright so for your second diagnosis here the newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation i think your pumping function will improve in time you know they got you to the lab quickly so i think that heart muscle is just stunned and you're very compliant you're very good with your medications and following through with those so i think it will recover so that said i want you to go ahead and continue continue your lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i do n't think you need a diuretic at this time but i do want to add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and then you'll need to get labs next week okay and then we're gon na repeat another echocardiogram echocardiocardiogram in about two months patient: okay","1527":"doctor: okay and then for your hypertension your third diagnosis of hypertension i want your to take your blood pressure just like you would you know every so often and then because your blood pressures actually seem fine at this time so we will continue to monitor that and i think you will tolerate the aldactone well as well patient: alright sounds good document","1528":"doctor: okay well you take care and you have a good evening patient: yeah you too","1529":"doctor: okay  good morning patient: good morning thanks doctor doctor cooper i'm i'm you know i'm a little i'm sad to be in here but you know thanks for taking me in i appreciate it","1530":"doctor: sure absolutely what can i help you with today patient: so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were","1531":"doctor: okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now patient: i have an albuterol inhaler","1532":"doctor: okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night patient: so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports","1533":"doctor: okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens patient: i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too","1534":"doctor: okay and then when you use your inhaler patient: mm-hmm","1535":"doctor: does it does it alleviate the problem patient: so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening","1536":"doctor: yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler patient: okay","1537":"doctor: so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler patient: mm-hmm","1538":"doctor: for the symptoms patient: yes","1539":"doctor: and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so patient: yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do","1540":"doctor: okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that patient: no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack","1541":"doctor: okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening patient: pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout","1542":"doctor: okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems patient: yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense","1543":"doctor: alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having patient: yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do","1544":"doctor: okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation patient: so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too","1545":"doctor: okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out patient: mm-hmm","1546":"doctor: and then we can talk a little bit more patient: okay","1547":"doctor: i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs patient: mm-hmm","1548":"doctor: and everything sounds good let me take a look at your eyes patient: mm-hmm","1549":"doctor: and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that patient: yeah i think so yeah","1550":"doctor: i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears patient: mm-hmm","1551":"doctor: and i'm gon na look in your mouth too patient: okay","1552":"doctor: and throat looks fine no tonsils patient: mm-hmm","1553":"doctor: lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach patient: okay","1554":"doctor: everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal patient: mm-hmm","1555":"doctor: everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal patient: awesome","1556":"doctor: it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair mm-hmm and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that in terms of the mood is this new for you patient: yeah i think so like when i started this year","1557":"doctor: and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that patient: yeah","1558":"doctor: okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start patient: mm-hmm","1559":"doctor: and we will do some screening questionnaires and and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too patient: okay","1560":"doctor: alright sounds like a plan patient: okay thank you","1561":"doctor: hey jean how're you doing today patient: i'm doing alright aside from this foot pain that i have","1562":"doctor: so i see here that you looks like you hurt your left foot here where you were playing soccer can you tell me a little bit more about what happened patient: yeah so yeah i was playing in a soccer game yesterday and i was trying to steal the ball from another player and she ended up falling directly onto my right foot and i do n't know i i mean i was trying to get around her and my body ended up twisting around her and then i accidentally felt a pain in my foot","1563":"doctor: okay so have you ever hurt your left foot before patient: no i've had a lot of injuries in soccer but never injured this foot","1564":"doctor: okay and then so after the fall and the entanglement with the other player were you able to continue playing patient: no i had to stop playing right away and actually being helped off the field","1565":"doctor: wow okay and what have you been doing for the the pain since then patient: so i've been keeping it elevated icing it the trainer wrapped it yesterday and taking ibuprofen as well","1566":"doctor: okay alright so without any ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is patient: without ibuprofen i would say my pain is a three","1567":"doctor: okay and then with your ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is patient: like a seven eight","1568":"doctor: okay so how long have you been playing soccer patient: really since i was like four five i've been playing a long time","1569":"doctor: well that's cool yeah we our our youngest daughter she is almost sixteen and she plays the inner marrial soccer league they are down at the rex center did is that where you started playing or did you guys did you start playing somewhere else patient: yeah just like this local town leak i started playing that way and then played all throughout school","1570":"doctor: that's patient: high school teams","1571":"doctor: that's awesome so just out of curiosity with the left foot have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or or any strange sensation patient: no i have not","1572":"doctor: okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of patient: alright thank you","1573":"doctor: you're welcome","1574":"doctor: hi virginia how're you today patient: i'm good thanks how are you","1575":"doctor: good so you know you got that knee x-ray when you first came in but tell me a little bit about what happened patient: i was playing basketball and jerry ran into me and the inside of my knee hurts","1576":"doctor: okay did you fall to the ground or did you just kinda plant and he pushed and you went one way and your knee did n't patient: i did fall to the ground","1577":"doctor: you did fall to the ground okay and did you land on the kneecap i mean did it hurt a lot were you able to get up and continue on patient: i landed on my side i was not able to continue on","1578":"doctor: okay so you get off the off the court is jerry a good player you just got ta ask that question patient: not really","1579":"doctor: okay okay well you know i love basketball i'm a little short for the game but i absolutely love to watch basketball so it's really cool that you're out there playing it so tell me about a little bit about where it hurts patient: on the inside","1580":"doctor: on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything patient: i had ice and an ace wrap","1581":"doctor: you had ice and what patient: an ace wrap","1582":"doctor: and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly patient: seven","1583":"doctor: seven days ago okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago so i'm gon na go ahead and now i also see that you're diabetic and that you take five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day are you still you're still on that medication is that correct patient: correct","1584":"doctor: and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home patient: every morning","1585":"doctor: okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all patient: no","1586":"doctor: okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt patient: yes","1587":"doctor: yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this patient: i did not no","1588":"doctor: you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today patient: some exercises ice and mobic","1589":"doctor: okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal patient: yes it hurts","1590":"doctor: okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me patient: when can i play basketball again","1591":"doctor: yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball patient: i just played the wife with fun","1592":"doctor: okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment patient: yeah they do","1593":"doctor: okay i you

know i'll just get on and take a look first but i'm gon na go ahead and get get you discharged i'll have my assistant come in we will get you discharged and like i said we will make an appointment for seven days and we will go from there any questions patient: i think you've answered them all thank you","1595":"doctor: okay great","1596":"doctor: okay raymond it looks like you've been having some difficulty swallowing over for a period of time could you tell me like what's going on patient: well i've been better for the last several weeks i've been noticing that it's been hard for me to swallow certain foods and i also have pain when i swallow down in my chest","1597":"doctor: okay and when does it does it happen every time you eat patient: it hurts not every time it hurts when i when i swallow most foods but it's really just the bigger pieces of food that seem like they're getting stuck","1598":"doctor: okay and what do you mean by bigger pieces of food like what's your diet like patient: well things have been stressed over the last couple of months so lacks a moving from the west coast of east coast so i've been drinking more eating things like pizza burgers i know it's

just really hurts so you know and so that's why i sit on the couch so much","1627":"doctor: okay alright no weakness or numbness in your legs right now patient: no","1628":"doctor: so let me examine you now gloria i'm gon na go ahead and do an exam and let's pretend i did my exam i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings just so i can record this and put it into my my into my chart so neck exam you do have a little bit of swelling in your neck little bit of jvd no bruits your lung exam you have some crackles in both bases and some rales that i can hear and there are a little bit of intermittent wheezing as well on your heart exam you have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you've had that in the past otherwise regular rate and rhythm it does n't feel a regular your belly exam your belly's slightly distended there's no tenderness or guarding or anything like that so that does n't that looks pretty good on your leg exam you do have some one plus pitting edema or actually almost one and a half plus pitting edema in your both of your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign that means no blood clots otherwise neurologic exam is normal the rest of your exam is normal so what does this all mean so let me explain that so for the first problem the shortness of breath you know i think you have an exacerbation of your congestive heart failure what i'd like to do is increase your dose of lasix from twenty milligrams to sixty milligrams for the next four days i'm gon na have you check your weights everyday and also i'm gon na go ahead and have you use your albuterol and atrovent we had given you some inhalers in the past i can give you another refill if you need to help with that some of the breathing that you're having the shortness of breath so i'd like to get some of this fluid off you have you check your weights daily we'll have you increase your dose of lasix we'll have you use a breathing treatments and see if that helps your shortness of breath i'd like to have you come back in about couple days actually i wan na see how you're doing and if it does n't get better we may have to increase the dose or send you to the hospital okay patient: i do n't want to go to the hospital doctor","1629":"doctor: yeah so let's try to let's try to use the lasix and let's try to let's try to you know use the breathing treatments and and do that for the second problem the diabetes that we just talked about i like to go ahead and order another blood test another hemoglobin a1c i think we need to your blood sugars have been running a little bit high in the past and we've had a hard time but it's been a while since we checked your last one so i wan na check another one today to see where we are and when we have you come back in a couple days we should have the results back we can then adjust your metformin or we may have to adjust some of the you know add a different medication at that point but but right now i'm gon na order some blood tests we'll have you come back in a couple of days and then we can reassess at that point okay patient: so i had a piece of cake before i came in here is that gon na affect the the lab work","1630":"doctor: yeah we'll probably do a fasting blood sugar we'll we'll order the hemoglobin a1c that should n't be actually matter because that checks long term but if we need your blood sugar may be elevated today i i would n't be surprised alright and i forgot to examine your back by the way so on your back exam you do have some tenderness in the paraspinal areas of your back in the in the lower back mostly no midline tenderness you have good reflexes so i think this is all muscular pain right now for your back pain i'm gon na go ahead and put you on some naprosyn and some flexeril which is a muscle relaxer i'm gon na give you some exercises you can do to help you get off the couch it'll also help your blood sugar and why do n't we have you if that does n't work the the pain medicine and the physical we can start physical therapy and see if that helps okay patient: okay","1631":"doctor: any questions about that patient: i do n't think so which color pills","1632":"doctor: i think it's a white pill and it's round patient: okay","1633":"doctor: about this big patient: alright sounds good","1634":"doctor: anything else gloria patient: no that's it","1635":"doctor: alright thanks for coming in today","1636":"doctor: hey matthew how're you doing patient: hey doc i'm doing pretty good how are you","1637":"doctor: i'm doing pretty good hey i see here in the nurse's notes it looks like you hurt your left ankle can you tell me a little bit more about that patient: yeah i did my wife and i were on a walk yesterday and i was just talking to her and and stepped off the curb and landed on it wrong it's kind of embarrassing but yeah it's been killing me for a couple days now","1638":"doctor: okay now when you fell did you feel or hear a pop or anything like that patient: i would n't say i really heard a pop it was just kind of really kind of felt extended and stretched and it it's just been really bothering me ever since kind of on the outside of it","1639":"doctor: okay and then were you able to walk on it after the incident patient: i was able to get back to the house because i did n't wan na you know make my wife carry me but it was it was painful","1640":"doctor: okay and then have you done any or had any injuries to that ankle before patient: nothing substantial that i would say in the past","1641":"doctor: okay and then what have you been doing for that left ankle since then have you done anything to help make it make the pain less patient: i have taken some ibuprofen and then i just tried to elevate it and ice it a little bit and keep my weight off of it","1642":"doctor: okay so let's talk real quick about your pain level zero being none ten being the worst pain you've been in in your life without any medication on board can you rate your pain for me patient: i would say it's about an eight","1643":"doctor: okay and then when you do take that ibuprofen or tylenol what what's your relief level what's your pain look like then patient: maybe a seven it it's a little","1644":"doctor: okay now you mentioned going for a walk my wife and i've been on on back behind the new rex center where the new trails are have you guys been back there patient: we have n't yet but i'm sure we'll check it out ever since i feel like working at home during covid we we we take walks all the time","1645":"doctor: yeah those those trails are great there's like five miles of regular flat trails and then there's a bunch of hiking trails that they've opened up as well it's a really great place man you guys need to get out there we'll get you fixed up and we'll get you back out there okay patient: awesome","1646":"doctor: so let's let's talk a little bit about my physical exam if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you your vitals look stable by the way a little elevated i know you're in pain on a focused exam of your left ankle now i do appreciate that there is ecchymosis or bruising over the lateral malleolus and there is some swelling i do i do appreciate some edema now you are positive for tenderness to palpation on the lateral side and the the soft tissue is swollen here the good news is i do not appreciate any laxity in the joint okay and i do n't feel any any type of bony tenderness to palpation of your foot now on the neurovascular exam of your left foot capillary refill is brisk less than three seconds and i do appreciate strong dorsalis pedis pulses and you do have motor and sensation intact which is good now it's important that they were compared bilaterally and they are yeah your your exam is the same bilaterally so that that's an important thing now we did do an x-ray of that left ankle when you came in so i'm gon na review those x-ray results with you now the good news is i do not appreciate a fracture or any bony abnormalities so that's a good thing right so let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem of your left ankle pain your symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex and the ligament on the outside of your ankle is what got stretched when you fell now the best treatment for this sprain is what you've kind of already been doing doing the elevation and compression and ice so we're gon na continue the rice protocol and i am gon na go ahead and give you an air cast just to stabilize that ankle i'm gon na prescribe you some crutches i want you to stay off that leg but i do want you to start walking as tolerated but it may be a few days before you feel like doing that now your symptoms are going to get better significantly over the first you know four five six seven days but i am gon na wan na follow up with you just to make sure you're doing okay so what i do is i would like to see you in two weeks and i'm gon na have you continue taking those nsaids as well to help reduce that pain and swelling any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in and get you fixed up patient: no i think that sounds like a plan","1647":"doctor: okay sounds good like i said i will see you in two weeks if you have any questions or if you have a lot of pain come back in we'll reevaluate otherwise i think you're headed in the right direction and i'll see you again in two weeks patient: awesome thanks document","1648":"doctor: alright thanks bye-bye","1649":"doctor: hey anna good to see you today so i'm looking here in my notes says you have you're coming in today for some right ankle pain after a fall so can you tell me what happened how did you fall patient: yeah so i was taking out the trash last night and i ended up slipping on a patch of ice like and then when i fell i heard this pop and it just hurts","1650":"doctor: okay so have you been able to walk on it at all or is it you know patient: at first no like my friend who was visiting thankfully had to help me get into the house and i you know and now i'm able to put like a little bit of weight on it but i'm i i'm still limping","1651":"doctor: okay well you know that's not good we'll we'll hopefully we can get you fixed up here so how much how much pain have you been in on a scale of one to ten with ten being the worst pain you ever felt patient: it's it's more like so when i first fell it was pretty bad but now it's it's at like a six you know like it's uncomfortable","1652":"doctor: okay and how would you describe that pain is it a constant pain or is it only when you move the ankle patient: it's it's constant it's like a throbbing pain you know and like when i touch it it feels kinda warm","1653":"doctor: okay alright yeah but yeah i can feel it here so it does feel a little bit warm so i said you've been in a little bit of pain so have you taken anything for it patient: well like last night i iced it and i kept it elevated you know i also took some ibuprofen last night and this morning","1654":"doctor: alright has the ibuprofen helped at all patient: not really","1655":"doctor: okay alright so i just want to know i know some of my patients they have like bad ankles where they hurt the ankles all the time but have you ever injured this ankle before patient: so you know in high school i used to play a lot of soccer but and and like i had other injuries but i've never injured like this particular ankle before but because i used to play like all the time i knew what i was supposed to do but this is i also knew that it was it was time to come in","1656":"doctor: okay yeah yeah definitely if you if you ca n't walk on it we definitely good thing that you came in today and we were able to see you so have you experienced any numbness in your foot at all patient: no no numbness and i do n't think i've had like any tingling or anything like that","1657":"doctor: okay that that's good yeah it sounds like you have sensation there so yeah that that's really good so let me do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals your blood pressure was one twenty over eighty which is good your heart rate your spo2 was ninety eight percent which is good that means you're you're getting all of your oxygen and so let me go ahead and look at your ankle real quick so when i press here does that hurt patient: yeah","1658":"doctor: alright what about here patient: yeah","1659":"doctor: okay so looking at your ankle and your right ankle exam on the skin there is ecchymosis so you have that bruising which you can see of the lateral patient: malleolus","1660":"doctor: malleolus associated with swelling there is tenderness to palpation of the anterior laterally in the soft tissue there is no laxity on the anterior drawer and inversion stress there is no bony tenderness on palpation of the foot on your neurovascular exam of your right foot there your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch alright so we did get an x-ray of your ankle before you came in and luckily it's there is no fractures no bony abnormalities which is really good so let me talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for your right ankle pain your symptoms your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain have you sprained your ankle before most times people do the athletics play soccer it happens every so often but have you done that before patient: no i do n't think so","1661":"doctor: okay well you're one of the lucky ones some of my my patients that play sports they sprain their ankle seems like every other week so good for you so for that that that ankle sprain i just want to keep i want you to keep your leg elevated when you're seated and i want you to continue to ice it you can ice it let's say five times a day for twenty minutes at a time just to help that swelling go down i'm gon na give you an air cast to help you stabilize the ankle so keep it from moving and then i'll give you crutches and so i want you to stay off that leg for about one to two days and then you can start walking on it as tolerated tolerated so how does that sound patient: it's alright","1662":"doctor: alright so do you have any questions for me patient: yeah like how long do you think it's gon na take for me to heal","1663":"doctor: i mean it should take a a couple of days i mean i think in a day or two you will be able to walk on it but still think it will be sore for the next couple of weeks you know your ankle sprain seems to be not the worst but it's kinda you know medium grade ankle sprain so as i would say about two to three weeks you should be back to normal you will see some of that bruising go away patient: yeah okay can i get a doctor's note","1664":"doctor: no because you need to go back to work because you work on the computer not running so patient: fine","1665":"doctor: yeah you ca n't get a doctor's note so if you if i write a note i'm gon na tell your boss that you have to go to work patient: okay thanks","1666":"doctor: so i i would n't do that but yeah but otherwise if if if you continue to have pain after this week if you feel like it's not getting better please feel free to contact the office and we can get you back in and possibly do an mri if we you know need to patient: okay","1667":"doctor: alright patient: alright","1668":"doctor: anything else patient: no that's it","1669":"doctor: alright thanks","1670":"doctor: hey gabriel i'm doctor scott good to see you today i know you've heard about dax is it okay if i tell dax a little bit about you patient: sure","1671":"doctor: okay so gabriel is a 43 -year-old male today here for back pain evaluation and also has a past medical history of diabetes high blood pressure and high cholesterol so gabriel tell me what's going on with your back patient: well i was working in the yard and you know bent over to pick something up and i got this pain and you know across the lower part of my back and then it went down my left leg and you know it's been going on for about four days and just does n't seem to be getting any better","1672":"doctor: okay are you a big gardener or this is something that you just started working in the yard patient: yeah i know my wife held a gun to my head make me go out there work in the yard and carry some stuff around it's not my not my first choice but","1673":"doctor: sure sure patient: but that day i i lost the i lost the argument","1674":"doctor: yeah yeah that happens to all of this so when this back pain happened so it was basically you were lifting you were bending down to lift something up and you had the sharp pain going down your right leg you said patient: left leg","1675":"doctor: left leg okay got it sorry and any weakness or numbness in your legs or just the pain mostly patient: in in certain positions i get some tingling but no mostly just pain","1676":"doctor: okay and any loss of bowel or bladder function at all or anything like that patient: no","1677":"doctor: okay and have you had any back surgeries or back problems in the past or this is kind of the first time patient: no surgeries you know i've i've had back pain occasionally over the years","1678":"doctor: okay have you had any any have you tried anything for pain for this have you tried any any medications at all patient: i've had ibuprofen it it helped some","1679":"doctor: okay got it alright well i'll i'll examine you in a second but before we do that let's talk about some of the other conditions that we're kinda following you for i'm looking at your problem list now and you've got a history of diabetes and you're on metformin five hundred milligram twice a day and your how are you doing with your blood sugars and your and your diet and exercise patient: yeah i i check my sugar two or three times a week most of the time it's in that one twenty to one forty range","1680":"doctor: okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that patient: yeah she still makes cookies and i still eat them but you know we are trying to trying to do better trying to stay away from more of those carbs and focus on you know less carby less sweet stuff","1681":"doctor: okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under balance so i'll order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check that again today and and you know just reemphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important and then we'll have those results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay patient: okay","1682":"doctor: for your high blood pressure your blood pressure in the clinic looks pretty good it's about one twenty over seventy right now we have you on norvasc five milligrams once a day how are things going with that are you are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all patient: yeah i guess i check it maybe once a week or two or three times a month and it it the vast majority of the time when i check it it's good usually either that one twenty to one thirty over seventy to eighty range i i think the blood pressure's okay","1683":"doctor: okay is that new or is that been going on for a while patient: well it it started maybe i do n't know a month or two after i started the norvasc","1684":"doctor: yeah i mean certainly it could be it is you know sometimes that medication can cause that so i'll i'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay patient: okay","1685":"doctor: alright so and your anything else bothering you today patient: no i'm we're doing okay i think","1686":"doctor: so let me examine you for a second i'm gon na go ahead and gabriel i'm gon na do my magic exam now let's pretend i i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings as i do my exam and so patient: these are like my video visit exams","1687":"doctor: exactly so your neck exam has no jvd there is no bruits that i can hear your lung exam no rales no wheezing on your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past so i'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam you do have some tenderness on the left paraspinal area right where i'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal you have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paraspinal area of your back when i palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam you do have this one plus nonpitting edema of your lower extremities which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign no signs of blood clot that's what that means so let me just review what you know explain what all this means so the back pain the first problem that you're here today for i think this is more of a muscular sprain i'm gon na recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory naprosyn five hundred five hundred milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it does n't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now i would start with that if that's okay with you any questions about that patient: no","1688":"doctor: okay for the diabetes the the second problem that we talked about today i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day why do n't we have you come back in about two weeks and we should have some of the results back and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that but right now we will continue the course and we will go from there okay for the high blood pressure you do have this one plus edema in your legs i'm gon na go ahead and order some blood work today i'm gon na go ahead and stop the norvasc and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide ten milligrams once a day and if that does n't get if the swelling does n't go away i'm gon na do some more testing for right now let's get some sort off with some cbc and a bmp i'm gon na check your kidney function i'm gon na get another ekg and also i'm gon na get a chest x-ray and we'll go from there but hopefully this will go away once we stop this medication since it started around that time okay okay and i think that's it anything else we forgot about do you need refills for anything patient: no i i think i'm okay you gave me a year's worth of refills last time we were together","1689":"doctor: okay sounds great alright thanks gabriel good seeing you again patient: good to see you thanks","1690":"doctor: hi elizabeth so i see that you were experiencing some kind of injury did you say that you hurt your knee patient: yes i hurt my knee when i was skiing two weeks ago","1691":"doctor: okay skiing that sounds exciting alright so what happened what what's when did the injury like what sorry what happened in the injury patient: so i was flying down this black diamond you know like i like to do","1692":"doctor: so we were downhill skiing racing at this point okay is it your left or your right knee patient: it's my right","1693":"doctor: okay and does it hurt on the inside or the outside patient: the inside","1694":"doctor: okay so the medial aspect of the right knee when you fell did you hear a pop patient: i did yes","1695":"doctor: okay alright patient: i think that was my left knee","1696":"doctor: okay okay alright so we got we got ta pick one if it if it patient: i'm just trying to be real","1697":"doctor: a hundred percent so how about this right now you're like i what i'm hearing is that you're experiencing bilateral knee pain like both of your knees hurt but i'm assuming that like your right knee hurts more is that correct patient: yeah my left knee does n't really hurt","1698":"doctor: gotcha gotcha okay yeah i think hmmm alright so we're gon na we're gon na go ahead and look at this sort of but on a scale of one to ten how severe is your pain patient: it's a seven","1699":"doctor: okay that's pretty bad alright and does it has it been increasing or like rapidly or slowly over the last few days patient: it's been slow","1700":"doctor: okay alright patient: but sometimes it gets to an eleven","1701":"doctor: okay what would do you know if you are doing something that would cause it to be an eleven are you back on your ski's patient: no i ca n't ski","1702":"doctor: okay does it hurt more when you walk for longer periods of time patient: yes","1703":"doctor: okay how long does the pain last patient: for as long as my walk is and i do n't sometimes i walk five minutes kinda depends on the wind","1704":"doctor: okay alright patient: sometimes i walk there is","1705":"doctor: okay alright have you done anything to help with the pain patient: well i wear a brace and i have used a lot of thc cream on it","1706":"doctor: okay alright thc cream is an interesting choice but do you think that's been helpful patient: yes","1707":"doctor: alright have you taken patient: reasons","1708":"doctor: not a problem have you taken any medications patient: no just gummies","1709":"doctor: okay like vitamins or more thc patient: kind of like thc gummies","1710":"doctor: thc gummies patient: my grandma gave them to me","1711":"doctor: thc gummies from grandma that's an excellent grandmother that you have okay have you noticed any swelling stiffness tenderness patient: yeah i i get a lot of swelling and it really is it's very stiff in the morning until i get walking","1712":"doctor: okay alright and then have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past patient: well i had surgery on my right knee before","1713":"doctor: okay so you've had surgery before alright do you remember what kind of surgery patient: i do n't know they told me they reconstructed the whole thing i was fourteen i was a really good gymnast back then really good","1714":"doctor: okay okay okay how so do you have any other exercises that i might wan na know about outside of intense gym and ski events patient: no i think that's about it","1715":"doctor: okay and how frequently do you normally ski patient: i ski probably three times a week","1716":"doctor: okay and then are you on any medications at this time other than the thc patient: no","1717":"doctor: okay alright what patient: nothing no","1718":"doctor: okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my examination i'm just gon na call it out for the sake of being able to document it appropriately and you or just just let me know if you want me to explain anything further so with your knee i know that you said it hurts on the right inside a lot right so when i press on the inside of your knee does that hurt patient: yes","1719":"doctor: okay and when i press on the outside of your left of your right knee sorry does that hurt patient: no","1720":"doctor: okay alright so when i move your your kneecap does that hurt patient: no it kinda makes a shooting pain down to my ankle though","1721":"doctor: okay so does the pain radiate frequently patient: no","1722":"doctor: okay alright on your skin exam i do appreciate some mild swelling and bruising that's really interesting since it's been two weeks with your knee are you able to bend it patient: yes","1723":"doctor: okay and then when you walked in on your gait i think i think i did appreciate a slight limp are you i i i i think you are you are protecting one of your knees does that sound familiar patient: yeah i waddle pretty pretty good now","1724":"doctor: okay alright and when you move your knee away from your body you're bending like your you're pulling it towards me does that hurt patient: yes","1725":"doctor: okay and then when you pull your knee back towards you does that hurt patient: no","1726":"doctor: alright so pain on dorsiflexion but not on plantar flexion plantar flexion okay alright so what we are gon na do right now i think i'm gon na look at your x-rays but when i when i look at the results of your x-ray i do not appreciate any fracture what i am noticing is the development of a little bit of arthritis and that could explain like why you say that your joints hurt a bit more during like windy weather and what not so this is what we're gon na do for my assessment and plan right the first thing is i think you have a strain of your posterior cruciate ligament what that means is what that will mean for you though is that we are gon na continue to brace your right knee that's gon na hopefully take off some of the stress that you might be putting on it especially since you're limping i am going to recommend you for physical therapy i think it would be an i think it's a good idea to maybe start three times a week to get your strength back into your knee i would recommend not skiing or doing any gymnastics for now and i think that physical therapy will really help considering the injury that you had when you were fourteen i'm gon na prescribe you some medications i do n't necessarily recommend consuming gummies at the same time but the medications i'm gon na give you are gon na be meloxicam fifteen milligrams you're gon na take that once a day that will help with like the swelling and the bruising i'm also gon na prescribe you just like a higher strength nsaid so ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams a day you can take that twice a day as needed for your left knee i think you are i think you just kind of like strength a little bit but like not enough to necessarily require any kind of like medication or bracing i think you just take it easy on your body i know that you're like very active from what i hear and i i think that that's really exciting but i think you might need to listen to your body and give yourself a bit of a break you'll be able to do like several workouts when you go to when you go to physical therapy but you know let the yeah let your therapist be your guide about like what you should and should not be putting your body through does that make sense patient: yes","1727":"doctor: alright do you have any questions right now patient: no thank you so much","1728":"doctor: no problem","1729":"doctor: hi , brian . how are you ? patient: hi , good to see you .","1730":"doctor: it's good to see you too . so , i know the nurse told you a little bit about dax . patient: mm-hmm .","1731":"doctor: i'd like to tell dax

but i wanted to make sure i stayed on top of that .","1744":"doctor: okay . all right . are you excited for halloween ? patient: uh , ca n't wait .","1745":"doctor: all right , yeah , right . patient:

check some things out , and i'll let you know what i find , okay ? patient: perfect .","1754":"doctor: okay . so , on your physical examination , you know , i do appreciate some jugular venous distention to- patient: mm-hmm .","1755":"doctor: to about eight centimeters . on your heart exam , i do appreciate a three out of six systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past . and , on your lung exam , i do appreciate some fine crackles at the bases bilaterally , and your lower extremities have , you know , 1+ pitting edema . so , what does all that mean ? that means i think you're retaining a little bit of fluid . patient: mm-hmm .","1756":"doctor: okay ? i wan na just go ahead and look at some of your results , okay ? patient: sure .","1757":"doctor: hey , dragon ? show me the chest x-ray . so , looking here at the results of your chest x-ray , it does look like you have a little bit of fluid in your lungs there , and that can be just from , um , your heart failure , okay ? hey , dragon ? show me the echocardiogram . so , this is the echocardiogram that we did about four months ago , and this shows that the pumping function of your heart is a little bit reduced at 45 % , and it also shows that leaky valve , the mitral regurgitation that , that you have , okay ? um , so , let me just go over and talk about , a little bit , my assessment and my plan for you . patient: mm-hmm .","1758":"doctor: okay ? so , for your first problem , your congestive heart failure , i think you're retaining fluid , and i wan na go ahead and increase your lasix to 80 mg once a day . patient: mm-hmm .","1759":"doctor: i want you to weigh yourself every day . i want you to call me if you're gaining more weight . patient: mm-hmm .","1760":"doctor: and , i certainly want you to

record your blood pressures at home , and report them to me in the patient portal if you see they're getting elevated , okay ? patient: mm-hmm .","1762":"doctor: does that sound like a plan ? patient: that sounds fine .","1763":"doctor: okay . um , i'm gon na be in touch with you after we get your test results , and we'll go from there , okay ? patient: sure .","1764":"doctor: all right . hey ,

stumble and kinda twisted my knee as i was trying to catch my fall .","1767":"doctor: okay . and did you injure yourself any place else ? patient: no , no . it just seems to be the knee .","1768":"doctor: all right . and when did this happen ? patient: it was yesterday .","1769":"doctor: all right . and , uh , where does it hurt mostly ? patient: it hurts like in , in , in the inside of my knee .","1770":"doctor: all right . and anything make it better or worse ? patient: i have been putting ice on it , uh , and i've been taking ibuprofen , but it does n't seem to help much .","1771":"doctor: okay . so it sounds like you fell a couple days ago , and you've hurt something inside of your right knee . patient: mm-hmm .","1772":"doctor: and you've been taking a little bit of ice , uh , putting some ice on it , and has n't really helped and some ibuprofen . is that right ? patient: that's right . yeah .","1773":"doctor: okay , let's review your past history for a second . it looks like , uh , do you have any other past medical history ? patient: uh , afib .","1774":"doctor: okay , and are you taking any medications for that ? patient: yeah , i am . um , begins with a d.","1775":"doctor: uh , digoxin ? patient: that's it . yeah , that's it .","1776":"doctor: okay , all right . how about any surgeries in the past ? patient: i have had a nose job .","1777":"doctor: all right . um , let's do your exam , okay ? so is it tender ... where is it mostly tender right now ? patient: right on the inside of my knee . right here .","1778":"doctor: all right , so if i bend your knee forward , does that seem to hurt ? patient: yes , that hurts .","1779":"doctor: all right , how about if i twist it a little bit that way . patient: that hurts a lot .","1780":"doctor: okay , okay . and how about down here ? do you feel me touch you down here ? patient: yes .","1781":"doctor: all right . any other pain down here in your calves ? patient: no .","1782":"doctor: no , okay . so on exam you do have some tenderness over the medial portion of your knee over the medial meniscus area . uh , there is no , uh , there is a little bit of tenderness when i flex your , uh , when i , uh , uh , do some valgus stressing on your , on your leg . um , you have normal sensation . so let's take a look at your x-rays . patient: okay .","1783":"doctor: okay . hey dragon , show me the x-rays . so looking at the x-ray , um , of your left knee , uh , it appears to be there's no fractures there right now . i do n't see any , uh , there's a little bit of , uh , fluid , uh , but there is no , uh , there's no , um , fracture or there's no dislocation . everything else seems to be lined up properly , okay ? patient: okay .","1784":"doctor: so in summary after my exam , uh , looking at your knee , uh , on the x-ray and your exam , you have some tenderness over the medial meniscus , so i think you have probably an acute medial meniscus sprain right now or strain . uh , at this point , my recommendation would be to put you in a knee brace , uh , and we'll go ahead and have you use some crutches temporarily for the next couple days . we'll have you come back in about a week and see how you're doing , and if it's not better , we'll get an mri at that time . patient: okay .","1785":"doctor: i'm going to recommend we give you some motrin , 800 milligrams . uh , you can take it about every six hours , uh , with food . uh , and we'll give you about a two week supply . patient: okay .","1786":"doctor: okay . uh , do you have any questions ? patient: no , i think i'm good .","1787":"doctor: all right . hey , dragon , order the medications and procedures discussed , and finalize the report . okay , come with me and we'll get you checked out .","1788":"doctor: hi logan .

ibuprofen , i used a little bit of icy heat on the spot but it really did n't seem to help .","1796":"doctor: okay . and um ... do you have any numbing or tingling in your legs ? patient: uh ... i felt some tingling in my toes on my right foot until about sunday afternoon . and then that seemed to go away .","1797":"doctor: okay , and is there a position that you feel better in ? patient: uh

pain to palpation of the lumbar spine . and you have pain with flexion and extension of the back . and you have a negative straight leg raise , which is which is good . so , let's- let's just look at some of your results , okay ? patient: mm-hmm .","1813":"doctor: hey dragon ? show me the diabetes labs . okay , so ... in reviewing the results of your diabetes labs , your hemoglobin a1c is a little elevated at eight . i'd like to see it a little bit better , okay ? patient: sure .","1814":"doctor: hey dragon ? show me the back x-ray . so in reviewing the results of your back x-ray , this looks

.","1818":"doctor: . and see how you do , okay ? patient: you got it .","1819":"doctor: for your next problem , your diabetes . y-you know , i think it's a little under- out of control . so i want to

of a , a tough spring with all the pollen and everything and , uh , we dropped my oldest daughter off at college and moved her into her dorm , so little stressful , little chaotic , in the heat of the summer , but so far , so good .","1830":"doctor: okay . i know . i know . that's a , that's a hard thing to get over , moving kids out of the house and that type of thing . patient: yeah .","1831":"doctor: so , um well , how are you doing from , you know , let's talk a little bit about your depression . how are you doing with that ? i know that we had put you on the prozac last year .

working with my hypertension . that's been a little bit more of a struggle than anything .","1832":"doctor: okay . yeah , i , i see that we have you on the norvasc . and so are you taking it at home ? is it running high , or ... patient: i ... i'm pretty regular with the medications during the business week , but on there's weekends , you know , if i'm on the fly or doing something , sometimes i forget , or i forget to bring it with me . uh , but for the most part , it's been okay .","1833":"doctor: okay . all right . um , and then i know that you've had that prior lobectomy a couple years ago . any issues with shortness of breath with all the allergies or anything ? patient: other than during the heat and the pollen , it's been pretty good .","1834":"doctor: okay . all right . so i , i

patient: sometimes i , i regularly , uh , go for a run in the morning . that's my workout , and sometimes if it's , uh , relatively humid , i'll struggle a little bit , and i might feel a little bit of pounding in my chest . it usually goes away , but , uh , again , for the most part , it's been pretty good .","1835":"doctor: okay , so you also have some shortness of breath with with exertion .

chest x-ray , which , which looks really good , uh , and you know , your prior lobectomy , there's no ... everything looks good , okay ? it looks normal . so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you . so for your first problem , your , your depression , it seems , again , like you're doing really well- patient: mm-hmm .","1843":"doctor: . with your current strategy . let's continue you on the prozac 20 milligrams a day and do you need a refill on that ? patient: uh , actually , i do need a refill .","1844":"doctor: okay . hey , dragon , order a refill of prozac , 20 milligrams daily . from a ... for your next problem , the lobectomy , i think , you know , i do n't think we need to do any more workup of that . it seems like you're exercising a lot . your breathing function is fine . so , uh , i , i do n't think you need to follow up with the surgeon anymore . and then for your last problem , your hypertension . patient: mm-hmm .","1845":"doctor: you're doing a great job of keeping it controlled . i know you said you have n't been taking it that much on the weekends , but your blood pressure here looks good , and it's much better over the last

you tried anything for this or anything made it better or worse ? patient: i tried , um , putting ice on it .","1853":"doctor: okay . and , uh , is it worse when you bend it ? or anything make it ... so , just wh- patient: yeah , movement .","1854":"doctor: okay . so , it sounds like you were skiing about four about days ago and you went over a mogul and got it hyper extended or got it bent backwards a little bit , ? okay . do you have any other past medical history at all ? patient: um , i have been suffering from constipation recently .","1855":"doctor: okay . all right . and do you

is sufficient . patient: miralax . yes .","1858":"doctor: and any surgeries in the past ? patient: i did have my appendix taken out when i was 18 .","1859":"doctor: okay . let's do your exam . uh , so , it's this finger right here . and does it hurt here on your , on this joint up here ? patient: no .","1860":"doctor: okay . and how'bout right there ? no ? patient: no .","1861":"doctor: right here ? patient: that hurts .","1862":"doctor: all right . uh , can you bend your finger for me ? patient: yeah .","1863":"doctor: all right . and how about extend it ? all right . and can you touch your thumb with it ? patient: yes .","1864":"doctor: all right . so , on exam , you do have some tenderness over your distal phalanx , which is the tip of your finger . there is , uh , some tenderness over that joint itself . i do n't feel any tenderness over your proximal joint or your metacarpophalangeal joint , which is right above your knuckle . uh , you have some pain flexion as well . so , let's look at your x-rays . hey , dragon , show me the x-rays . all right . so , on this x-ray.everything looks normal right now . uh , i do n't see any fractures . everything lines up pretty well . uh , so , your x-ray looks normal with no fractures . so , based on the x-ray and your exam , you have some tenderness right here . i think you've got a little contusion right here . there's no fracture on the tip of your finger . uh , so , the diagnosis would be a right hand , uh , index finger contusion on the tip of your finger , okay ? so , i would recommend we get you a s- uh , aluminum foam splint and we'll get you some motrin . uh , we'll give you 600 milligrams every six hours and we'll take that for about a week . and if it does n't get better , why do n't you call us and come back at that point ? patient: okay .","1865":"doctor: okay . do you have any questions ? patient: no . i think that sounds good .","1866":"doctor: okay . hey , dragon , order the medication and procedures we discussed . all right . and why do n't you come with me and we'll get you signed out . patient: okay . thank you .","1867":"doctor: all right . finalize report , dragon .","1868":"doctor: today i'm

patient: i'm good , thank you .","1869":"doctor: so tell me what brings you in today . patient: recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic .","1870":"doctor: or how have you been feeling in general with this ? patient: not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me .","1871":"doctor: okay . are there any other symptoms ? patient: i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess .","1872":"doctor: sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ? patient: yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .","1873":"doctor: right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ? patient: well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .","1874":"doctor: yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ? patient: about five to six years ago .","1875":"doctor: and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ? patient: no . they said they'd see me in 10 years .","1876":"doctor: well that's good news . patient: yeah , i agree .","1877":"doctor: um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ? patient: no .","1878":"doctor: all right . do you ever drink alcohol ? patient: yeah , but only once or twice a year .","1879":"doctor: okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ? patient: i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year .","1880":"doctor: all right . and what are you taking ? patient: i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily .","1881":"doctor: okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ? patient: yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening .","1882":"doctor: okay . anything else ? patient: yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff .","1883":"doctor: okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on . patient: sounds good . thank you .","1884":"doctor: of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented . patient: okay .","1885":"doctor: all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs . patient: okay .","1886":"doctor: all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen . patient: okay .","1887":"doctor: is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ? patient: no .","1888":"doctor: okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding . patient: is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?","1889":"doctor: actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why . patient: lovely .","1890":"doctor: yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system . patient: okay .","1891":"doctor: we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better . patient: all right .","1892":"doctor: so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled . patient: okay .","1893":"doctor: um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ? patient: no , i was just sleepy afterwards .","1894":"doctor: okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy . patient: okay . sounds like a plan .","1895":"doctor: all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work . patient: okay , that sounds great .","1896":"doctor: all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you . patient: thank you .","1897":"doctor: you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper . patient: you too .","1898":"doctor: all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01\/20\/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .","1899":"doctor: patient , bruce ward . date of birth 5\/21\/1969 . please use my neuro consult template . this is a 52-year-old male with dia- newly diagnosed pituitary lesion . the patient is seen in consultation at the request of dr. henry howard for possible surgical intervention . mr . ward presented to his primary care provider , dr. howard , on 3\/1\/21 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months . he denied any trouble with headaches in the past . his past clinical history is unremarkable . worked out for worsening headaches was initiated with brain mri and serology where pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered . i personally reviewed the labs dated 3\/3\/21 including cbc , unes , uh , coagulation , and crp . all were normal . pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low tsh , all other results were normal . um , i personally reviewed pertinent radiology studies including mri for the brain with contrast from 3\/4\/21 . the mri reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm . the ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are lo- are noted . hello , mr . ward . nice to meet you . i'm dr. flores . patient: hi , doc . nice to meet you .","1900":"doctor: i was just reviewing your records from dr. howard and he's referred you because the workup for headaches revealed a mass on your pituitary gland . i did review your mri images and you have a significant mass there . can you tell me about the issues you've been experiencing ? patient: yeah sure . so i'm really getting fed up with these headaches . i've been trying my best to deal with them but they've been going on for months now and i'm really struggling .","1901":"doctor: where are the headaches located and how would you describe that pain ? patient: located behind my eyes . it's like a dull nagging ache .","1902":"doctor: okay . was the onset gradual or sudden ? patient: well it started about three months ago . and they've been getting worse over time . at first it was like three out of 10 severity , and it just gradually worsened . and now it's about six out of 10 severity . the headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and it feels like a dull ache behind the eyes . they last a few hours at a time , nothing makes them better or worse .","1903":"doctor: okay . can you tell me if the pain radiates , or if you have any other symptoms ? specifically feeling sick , fever , rashes , neck stiffness , numbness , weakness , passing out ? patient: no . i have n't been sick or felt sick . ca n't recall a fever or any kind of rash . no- no neck issues , no numbness , no tingling . and i've never passed out in my life . but , um , for some reason recently i seem to be bumping into door frames .","1904":"doctor: okay . have you noticed any change in your vision or with your balance ? patient: no i do n't think so . my eyes were checked in the fall .","1905":"doctor: okay . let's see , do you have any other medical problems that you take medicine for ? patient: no i do n't have any medical problems and i do n't take any medicines . i tried tylenol a few times for the headaches but it did n't work , so i stopped .","1906":"doctor: i see . anyone in your family have any history of diseases ? patient: i was adopted so i really have no idea .","1907":"doctor: okay . um , what kind of work do you do ? and are you married ? patient: i work as a computer programmer and i've been married for 25 years . we just bought a small house .","1908":"doctor: that's nice . um , do you drink any alcohol , smoke , or use recreational drugs ? patient: nope . i do n't do any of those and never have .","1909":"doctor: okay . um , well let me take a good look at you . um , now you'll hear me calling out some details as i perform the examination . these will be noted for me in your record and i'll be happy to answer any questions you have once we're done . patient: sounds good , doc .","1910":"doctor: all right . the patient is alert , oriented to time , place , and person . affect is appropriate and speech is fluent . cranial nerve examination is grossly intact . no focal , motor , or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities . visual acuity and eye movements are normal . pupils are equal and reactive . visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia . and color vision is normal . all right , mr. ward . i'm going to review these pictures from the mri with you . um , now this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma , but there's no way to be sure without sending the removed adenoma to pathology to make the diagnosis , which we will do . um , here you can see it's a well defined mass . and it's pressing right here on what we call the optic chiasm . and today when i was having you look at my fingers , you could n't see them off to the sides , that's what we call bitemporal hemianopia . and explains why you have been bumping into door frames . patient: yeah i never noticed that i could n't see out of the side until you did that test , and you closed one eye with both eyes . i really could n't tell .","1911":"doctor: no because you're having this vision loss from the mass compressing the optic chiasm , the only option we have is to do surgery . patient: okay , i understand . do you think i'll regain my vision ?","1912":"doctor: well there's no guarantees , but it is a possibility . i'm gon na refer you to the eye doctor for a full exam and they'll do what's called visual field test . this will map our your peripheral vision or side vision prior to surgery . and we can monitor after surgery to see if your vision is improving . patient: all right .","1913":"doctor: and let's discuss the surgery a little more . um , we would do what's called a transsphenoidal approach to do the surgery . this is minimally invasive and we go through the sphenoid sinus . there are some risks i have to inform you of . uh , risk of anesthesia including but not limited to the risk of heart attack , stroke , and death . risk of surgery include infection , need for further surgery , wound issues such as spinal fluid leak or infection , uh , which may require long , prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure . uh , seizure , stroke , permanent numbness , weakness , difficulty speaking , or even death . patient: well i guess we have to do it regardless .","1914":"doctor: okay . so i will have you see our surgery scheduler , deborah , on the way out to get you set up . we will get this scheduled fairly quickly so i do n't want you to be alarmed . um , she'll also get you set up today or tomorrow to have the visual field test and you may not be able to see the eye doctor until after surgery . but we have the pre-surgery visual field test for comparison after surgery . patient: okay . i look forward to these headaches going away . i never thought it could be something like this going on .","1915":"doctor: yeah . come this way , we'll get your things lined up . please call if you think of any questions . patient: thanks , doctor .","1916":"doctor: diagnosis will be pituitary adenoma . mr . ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has benign appearing pituitary adenoma , incidentally discovered during workup for worsening headaches . he is symptomatic with clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression , therefor surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated . end of note .","1917":"doctor: next is betty hill , uh , date of birth is 2\/21\/1968 . she has a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia . she's a new patient with a referral from the er of esophagitis . um , i reviewed our records from the er , including the normal cardiac workup , and we're about to go in and see her now . good morning . you miss hill ? patient: good morning . yes . that's me .","1918":"doctor: hey , i'm dr. sanders . it's nice to meet you . patient: nice to meet you too .","1919":"doctor: so tell me about what brings you in today ? patient: well , i really needed to see you three months ... three months ago , but this was your first available appointment . when i called to make the appointment , i was having chest pains , but it stopped after four days , and i have n't had any since then .","1920":"doctor: okay . when did these four days of chest pain occur ? patient: um , early october .","1921":"doctor: of 2020 , correct ? patient: yes .","1922":"doctor: okay . can you think of anything that might have caused the chest pain ? did you wake up with it ? patient: no . it just it randomly . i tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it . they did a bunch of testing and did n't find anything .","1923":"doctor: okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ? patient: well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp .","1924":"doctor: did they prescribe you any medications in the er ? patient: no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .","1925":"doctor: okay . i see . patient: they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here .","1926":"doctor: interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ? patient: uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like .","1927":"doctor: was the pain worse with eating or exercise ? patient: yes . with eating .","1928":"doctor: okay . any difficulty swallowing ? patient: mm-hmm . i did .","1929":"doctor: okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ? patient: yes . thankfully . the chest pain and swallowing problem got better about three days after i went to the er . but i just feel like there's something wrong .","1930":"doctor: okay . so how has your weight been . patient: i've been trying to lose weight .","1931":"doctor: that's good . any in- ... issues with abdominal pain ? patient: uh , no .","1932":"doctor: okay . good . and how about your bowel movements ; are they okay ? patient: they're normal .","1933":"doctor: all right . are you aware of any family history of gi problems ? patient: i do n't think so .","1934":"doctor: have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ? patient: yes . they took my gall bladder out several years ago .","1935":"doctor: okay . if you wan na lay down here on the table for me and lets take a look at you . patient: okay .","1936":"doctor: so when i push on your lower belly , do you have any pain , or does it feel tender ? patient: no .","1937":"doctor: okay . how about up here in your upper abdomen ? patient: yes . it , it hurts a little .","1938":"doctor: okay . and even when i press lightly like this ? patient: yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable .","1939":"doctor: okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ? patient: i'd say it's about the same .","1940":"doctor: okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good . patient: okay . good .","1941":"doctor: so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days . patient: well , since you mention anxiety , i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time this happened .","1942":"doctor: okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition . patient: okay .","1943":"doctor: so we could do an , uh , egd or upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis . but your symptoms occurred three months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes , so likely if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point ... by this point , and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor , uh , for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd . uh , with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option . but what do you think ? patient: i'd like to hold off on the egd and wait to see if i have more symptoms .","1944":"doctor: that sounds good . um , so you can call the office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we'll get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow up with me ... follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints . patient: okay .","1945":"doctor: all right ? if you do n't have any questions for me , i'll walk you out to the check-out desk . patient: no . that's it . thank you .","1946":"doctor: you're welcome . right this way . all right . uh , in assessment , please summarize the patient's history briefly , and let's list her possible etiologies such as , uh , gerd , dyspepsia , esophagitis , musculoskeletal etiologies , and anxiety . uh , suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition , plus or minus a contribution from her musculoskeletal etiologies . um , in the plan , include our discussion of the egd versus monderning ... monitoring for symptom . patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change . thanks .","1947":"doctor: hello . patient_guest: hi .","1948":"doctor: i'm dr.

was a bit smaller , at 3 pounds , 13 ounces .","1953":"doctor: like preemie type stuff ? patient_guest: uh- . yeah . she just had a hard time regulating her temperature , but she did fine . she does have a gi doctor , because she has reflex really bad . she also had a dietician , who told us to take her off cow's milk . which we did . and then she has seen an allergist , and also a neurologist ... who diagnosed her with this syndrome , because she still does n't walk and she was n't sitting by herself a year old .","1954":"doctor: yeah . patient_guest: but so now she is crawling and she is trying to take steps , so think she's doing pretty good .","1955":"doctor: good . is she in therapy ? patient_guest: she is in therapy . she's in feeding therapy , occupational therapy , and also physical therapy .","1956":"doctor: awesome . okay . patient_guest: and we also have speech therapy , who is going to be starting within the next couple of weeks .","1957":"doctor: that's great .

right ? patient_guest: yes .","1959":"doctor: yeah , wow. . patient_guest: yeah , it has definitely been a whirlwind of stuff . when we saw the geneticist , she told us that sometimes people with this syndrome , they have trouble with their kidneys . that they might actually fuse into one . she also said sometimes they have problems with their legs , so that was why we saw ortho .","1960":"doctor: okay . okay . patient_guest: so we have seen everybody , really . we are just here to make sure that her kidneys are looking good right now .","1961":"doctor: yeah , okay . so , um , tell me about how many wet diapers she has in a 24 hour period ? patient_guest: she has a lot .","1962":"doctor: so like normal 8 to 10 , or like 20 ? patient_guest: yeah , it's around 8 to 10 .","1963":"doctor: okay . great . patient_guest: yeah , she seems to pee a lot , and it feels like she drinks a lot too .","1964":"doctor: that's perfect . patient_guest: and she used to only drink milk , and then i took her off dairy milk . so when i say milk , i actually mean , you know , ripple pea protein milk .","1965":"doctor: sure , yeah . patient_guest: so i give her that milk , water now that she's used to it , and sometimes water with just a little bit of juice . so i do feel like she's drinking a lot better now .","1966":"doctor: that's great . and she's how old now ? patient_guest: she'll be two mo- two next month .","1967":"doctor: okay . is her twin a boy or a girl ? patient_guest: she's a girl .","1968":"doctor: okay , and how's she doing ? patient_guest: she's doing really good . she's running around , and she does n't have any problems .","1969":"doctor: all right . is she bigger than her or the same size ? patient_guest: they're about the same size . they're able to wear the same clothes , so ...","1970":"doctor: okay . patient_guest: i do n't even think she's a pound hav- heavier , actually .","1971":"doctor: yeah . yeah . patient_guest: but she is a little bit taller than her ... um , katherine . she's just sh- a little shorter and chunkier , but i think that's a part of her syndrome .","1972":"doctor: yeah . yeah , i was reading all the things associated with the syndrome . it sounds like we're looking for continual- congenital anomalies wi- of the kidney and urinary tract . which is basically something is wrong with the plumbing . patient_guest: okay .","1973":"doctor: so the only way to know that , is to do a kidney ultrasound . patient_guest: okay , that sounds okay .","1974":"doctor: okay . let me put that into the system , and then downstairs they can do the ultrasound . patient_guest: all right , thank you .","1975":"doctor: okay , yeah . where do you all live ? patient_guest: uh , we live in dallas .","1976":"doctor: okay . anybody in the family with

patient: yeah i was walking up and down the stairs i was doing my laundry and i slipped and i tried to catch myself and i put my arms out to catch myself and then all of a sudden i just my wrist started to hurt real bad and it got real swollen","1986":"doctor: wow okay so which wrist are we talking about left or right patient: it's my right one of course","1987":"doctor: okay and then have you ever injured this arm before patient: no i have not","1988":"doctor: okay alright so on a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain patient: gosh it's like a nine","1989":"doctor: wow okay have you done anything to ease it patient: yeah i did the ice thing i put ice on it and then i you know i even i have a ace wrap at home i try to do that","1990":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right","1991":"doctor: yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen patient: this happened yesterday morning","1992":"doctor: okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry patient: yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally","1993":"doctor: okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere patient: no not really","1994":"doctor: okay any numbness any tingling patient: a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still","1995":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: but just maybe a little bit of tingling","1996":"doctor: okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright patient: okay","1997":"doctor: okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt patient: yes","1998":"doctor: and what about the outside does that hurt as well patient: yeah it does","1999":"doctor: are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like patient: not without extreme pain","2000":"doctor: okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up patient: yeah i have a hard time doing that actually","2001":"doctor: alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt patient: yeah","2002":"doctor: alright and then lateral as well patient: yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason","2003":"doctor: alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist patient: hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight","2004":"doctor: okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you patient: yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all","2005":"doctor: okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down patient: it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better","2006":"doctor: okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to patient: i'm sorry","2007":"doctor: pardon what patient: a what","2008":"doctor: we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace patient: okay thank you","2009":"doctor: sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay patient: when do i have to have the surgery","2010":"doctor: we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform patient: okay","2011":"doctor: alright so what patient: how how long do i have to wear that brace","2012":"doctor: you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks patient: six weeks","2013":"doctor: yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of patient: oof","2014":"doctor: these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions patient: no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery","2015":"doctor: okay how long is the vacation patient: it's only for like a couple weeks","2016":"doctor: okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks patient: no vacation in a month","2017":"doctor: okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do patient: that sounds good thank you","2018":"doctor: no problem bye patient: bye","2019":"doctor: the fracture appears extra-articular and usually proximal to the radial ulnar joint dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree if dorsal angulation is severe presenting with a dinner fork deformity ulnar styloid fracture is present","2020":"doctor: hey philip good to see you today so take a look here at my notes i see you're coming in for some right knee pain and you have a past medical history of hypertension and we will take a look at that so can you tell me what happened to your knee patient: yeah i was you know i was just doing some work on my property and i i accidentally slipped and fell down and i just still having some knee issues","2021":"doctor: okay well that that's not good do you patient: no","2022":"doctor: what part of your knee would you say hurts patient: i would just say you know the it it you know it basically when i when i'm flexing my knee when i'm moving it up and down and i put pressure on it","2023":"doctor: alright did you hear a pop or anything like that patient: i did feel something pop yes","2024":"doctor: okay and did it was it swollen afterwards or is it looks a little bit swollen right now patient: yeah little bit swollen yeah","2025":"doctor: okay so so far have you taken anything for the pain patient: just taking some ibuprofen just for some swelling","2026":"doctor: okay that's it what would you say your pain score is a out of ten with ten being the worst pain you ever felt patient: i would say that when i'm stationary i do n't really feel a lot of pain but if i start doing some mobility i would say probably a four five","2027":"doctor: about a four okay and how long ago did you say this was is this happened this injury patient: it's been a week now","2028":"doctor: a week okay alright alright so we will take a look i'll do a physical exam of your knee in a second but i do want to check up you do have a past medical history of hypertension i'm seeing here you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was one fifty over seventy so have you been taking your medications regularly patient: yes i have","2029":"doctor: okay so you might have a little white coat syndrome i know some of my patients definitely do have that so what about your diet i know we talked a little bit before about you reducing your sodium intake to about twenty three hundred milligrams per per day i know you were during the pandemic your diet got out of little bit out of control so how have you been doing how have you been doing with that patient: i definitely need some help there i have not have not made some some changes","2030":"doctor: okay yeah we definitely need to get you to lower that salt intake get your diet a little bit better because the hope is to get you off that medication and get your blood pressure to a manageable level okay so we yeah we definitely can talk about that alright so lem me take a look at your knee i'll do a quick physical exam on you and before i do just want to make sure you're not having any chest pain today patient: no","2031":"doctor: are you any belly pain patient: no","2032":"doctor: no shortness of breath just wan na make sure patient: no","2033":"doctor: okay so i'm just gon na listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any wheezes or crackles listen to your heart so on your heart exam i do still hear that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and you already had that and so we we knew about that already so lem me look at your knee here so when i press here on the inside of your knee does that hurt patient: a little bit","2034":"doctor: little bit how about when i press on the outs the outside gon na press on the outside is that painful patient: no","2035":"doctor: no alright so i'm gon na have you flex your knee is that painful patient: yeah that's uncomfortable","2036":"doctor: that's uncomfortable and extend it so that's painful patient: yeah yes","2037":"doctor: okay so on your knee exam i i see that you do have pain to palpation of the medial aspect of your right knee you have some pain with flexion extension i also identify some edema around the knee and some effusion you have a little bit of fluid in there as well so prior to coming in we did do an x-ray of that right knee and luckily you did n't break anything so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have what we call a mcl strain so a medial collateral ligament strain so when you fell i think you twisted a little bit and so it irritated you strained that that ligament there so for that what we can do for you first i'm gon na prescribe you some ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams and you can take that twice a day and that's gon na help you with that swelling and that pain that you currently do have i'm also gon na put you in a a knee brace just to try and support those muscles to allow it to heal and then i want you to ice the knee you can do that for twenty minutes at a time for three to four times a day that should also help with the the swelling of your knee for your hypertension now i'm gon na keep you on that twenty of lisinopril okay because you are taking it and you you're doing pretty good with it i also want to get you a referral to nutrition just to try to help you with that diet you know because right now you are your diet is little bit out of control so we just need to rain you in a little bit and hopefully you know with their help we can eventually get you off that lisinopril alright so do you have any questions for me patient: do i need to elevate my leg or stay off my leg or","2038":"doctor: yeah i would yeah you can elevate your leg stay off your stay off your leg you know if you have any kids have them work out in the yard instead of you just to to for a couple of weeks it's a good thing if you want to do that patient: tell him this doctor's order","2039":"doctor: tell definitely tell him his doctor tell him i said it patient: alright do you have any other questions no that's it i appreciate you seeing me","2040":"doctor: alright so my nurse will be in with the those orders and we will see you next time","2041":"doctor: hi wayne how're you today patient: i'm doing okay aside from this left shoulder pain that i've been having","2042":"doctor: okay and how long have you had this pain patient: about i want to say a few weeks i think it's been about three weeks now","2043":"doctor: okay and do you remember what you were doing when the pain started patient: honestly i've been trying to recall if i had any specific injury and i ca n't think of that","2044":"doctor: okay alright tell me have you ever had pain in that shoulder before patient: you know i i'm really active and so i i will get some aches and pains here and there but nothing that tylenol ca n't take care of","2045":"doctor: okay good but now are you able to move your arm patient: you know i have trouble when i'm trying to reach for something or lift any objects and i do n't even try to reach it for anything over my head because then it'll really hurt","2046":"doctor: okay alright and and now are you having the pain all the time or does it come and go patient: the pain is always there and then it gets worse like if i try to put any pressure on it it gets worse so if i'm laying at night if i try to even lay on that shoulder it's unbearable","2047":"doctor: okay and then tell me what have you taken for your pain patient: i've been taking two extra strength tylenol every six to eight hours","2048":"doctor: alright and and did that help patient: it does take the edge off but i still have some pain","2049":"doctor: okay well i'm sorry to hear that you know you know renovating the basement it can be quite a task and it can take a toll on you patient: yeah i mean it's been fun but yeah i think it really did take a toll on me","2050":"doctor: yeah what what are you doing with your basement are you are you doing like a a man cave or patient: yeah yeah that's exactly right","2051":"doctor: that is awesome great well that sounds like fun i hope you get to set it up just the way you you would like for your man cave to be so congratulations to you there so tell me have you experienced any kind of numbness in your arms or in your hands patient: no no numbness or tingling","2052":"doctor: okay alright so let's just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here i did review your vitals everything here looks good now lem me take a look at your shoulder alright now on your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion and how does that feel here patient: that hurts","2053":"doctor: okay sorry there is tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus but there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints you have good hand grips alright and then now on your neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is intact to light touch alright so what does that all mean well firstly lem me go ahead and take a look at your results of your shoulder x-ray here now i reviewed the results and there are no fractures so that's good so let's go ahead and talk about my assessment and plan here wayne so for your problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured the tendons of the muscles that help make up your shoulder muscles so i will be ordering an mri for your left shoulder to be sure that there is nothing else going on with your shoulder okay patient: okay","2054":"doctor: now i'm also going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and during that time you may also continue to take tylenol now if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection for your shoulder which can provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan at all patient: so do you think this pain will ever go away","2055":"doctor: now well many patients are very successful with the physical therapy those will those help strengthen you know they do a lot of strengthening exercises with you to help strengthen you know your muscles so that it's not your movements not always relying on those joints predominantly so we're gon na go ahead and start with that and then see how you do okay patient: okay okay","2056":"doctor: alright okay well do you have any other questions for me patient: no i think that's it","2057":"doctor: okay well i'm gon na have the nurse check you out and she's also gon na give you some educational materials on the physical therapy and what to expect and and then go ahead and schedule a follow-up visit with me as well after you you do your physical therapy okay patient: okay","2058":"doctor: alright well have a good day patient: okay you too","2059":"doctor: thanks patient: okay bye","2060":"doctor: okay hi andrea well i patient: hello","2061":"doctor: i understand you're you've come in with some right knee pain can you tell me about it what's going on patient: it it's not the right knee it's the left knee","2062":"doctor: okay the left knee patient: and it just happens occasionally less than once a day when i'm walking all of a sudden it is kind of like gives out and i think here i'm going to fall but i usually catch myself so lot of times i have to hold a grocery cart and that helps a lot so it comes and goes and it it passes just about as quickly as it comes i do n't know what it is whether i stepped wrong or i just do n't know","2063":"doctor: okay well so where does it hurt like in on the inside or the outside or patient: internally and it it just the whole kneecap fades","2064":"doctor: okay well did you hear or feel a pop at any point patient: no","2065":"doctor: have you ever had any type of injury to that knee i mean did you fall or bump it against something or patient: no not that i can recall","2066":"doctor: okay and have is it painful have you taken anything for for pain patient: no because it does n't last that long","2067":"doctor: so is it interfering with your just things you like to do and patient: hmmm no not really","2068":"doctor: so i know you said that you like to do a lot of travel patient: yeah i've got a trip planned here in the next month or so and we are going down to columbus georgia to a a lion's club function and probably be doing a lot of walking there and they got some line dances planned and i do n't think i will be able to participate in that because of the knee","2069":"doctor: is that where you would be kicking your leg out or something patient: no it's do n't you know what line dancing is like dancing in theories of fairly fast moves but it's mostly sideways motion","2070":"doctor: and is and that you think that's when your knee might give out then or just not gon na take the chance patient: not gon na take the chance","2071":"doctor: okay yeah that sounds like a good idea have you thought about even having a a cane just in case or do you think that's does that happen often enough patient: wrap it i would n't be able to keep track of it so no no pain","2072":"doctor: okay okay well so since you're in how about your blood pressure how how is it doing and have you been taking your blood pressures at home like we talked about patient: yes they are doing fine still about the same","2073":"doctor: so what has it been running patient: i ca n't really remember it's been several days since i took it but i think it runs around one twenty over seventy somewhere along in there","2074":"doctor: okay alright and so what about your medication we have you on some medication for your blood pressure right patient: yes i take take them regularly at eight thirty in the morning and eight thirty at night","2075":"doctor: and what is the medication and the dosage that you are taking patient: i'm taking a farxiga and amlodipine","2076":"doctor: that but yeah go ahead patient: no that was it i just take them regularly eight thirty in the morning eight thirty at night","2077":"doctor: yeah well that's good i i know you said you set an alarm on your phone to make sure that you get them taken at the right time so that's really good and how are your blood sugars doing how is your diet doing patient: my blood sugar has been running a little higher at about one thirty","2078":"doctor: is that in the morning when you're fasting patient: yes","2079":"doctor: and are you taking your metformin patient: yes yes that's along with the blood pressure medicine morning and night","2080":"doctor: okay alright so are you are you eating like late at night or anything like that patient: no we usually eat by six","2081":"doctor: okay okay alright well hopefully we can get you to feeling better okay so i want to do a quick physical exam really check that knee out so your vital signs look good they they look alright your temperature is ninety eight . two your pulse is seventy two respirations are sixteen blood pressure is one twenty two over seventy so that looks fine i'm gon na go ahead and take a listen to your heart and lungs so on your heart exam it's a nice regular rate and rhythm but i appreciate a slight two over six systolic ejection murmur at the left base here on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally okay now let's take a quick look at that knee so does it hurt when i press on it patient: no","2082":"doctor: okay can you bend your knee and straighten it out patient: yes","2083":"doctor: okay i'm gon na do some maneuvers and i'm gon na just gon na call out my findings on this okay on your right knee exam no ecchymosis or edema no effusion no pain to palpation of the of the left medial knee is there any decreased range of motion do you feel you feel like you're you're able to fully move that as you should the same as the other knee patient: yeah","2084":"doctor: okay so no decreased range of motion negative varus and valgus test okay and so with your x-rays i reviewed the result of your left knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so lem me tell you a little bit about my plan so your left knee pain i think you just have some arthritis in that i want to prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams a day we might do some physical therapy for that just to strengthen the muscles around that area and prevent any further problems with that okay and so for your second problem the hypertension so i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams a day and order an echocardiogram just to evaluate that heart murmur alright and patient: okay","2085":"doctor: for the diabetes mellitus i wan na order a hemoglobin a1c to see if we need to make any adjustments to your metformin and i'm also gon na order a lipid panel okay do you have any questions patient: no i do n't think so when will all this take place","2086":"doctor: we will get you scheduled for the echocardiogram i will have my nurse come in and we will get that set up okay","2087":"doctor: so beverly is a 53 -year-old female with a recent diagnosis of stage three nonsmile cell lung cancer who presents for follow-up during neo agit chemotherapy she was diagnosed with a four . four centimeter left upper lobe nodule biopsy was positive for adenocarcinoma molecular testing is pending at this time alright hello beverly how are you patient: i'm good today","2088":"doctor: you're good today yeah you've been going through a lot lately i know you just had your treatment how how are your symptoms patient: my symptoms are pretty good today i just kind of have a minimal cough and a sore throat","2089":"doctor: okay and how about fatigue have you been feeling more tired patient: yes a little bit","2090":"doctor: okay and how about any nausea or vomiting patient: no not as of today","2091":"doctor: okay and i know you were mentioning a cough before how is it as far as walking are you having any shortness of breath patient: i have n't noticed any shortness of breath it just kind of seems to be a lingering kind of light dry cough","2092":"doctor: cough okay is it any mucus with it or is it a dry cough patient: more dry","2093":"doctor: a dry cough okay and tell me more about this sore throat patient: this kind of seems to be persistent comes and goes it will be worse sometimes and then others it feels better trying to drink lots of fluids","2094":"doctor: okay and when you mention drinking and eating is do you feel like anything is getting stuck there patient: no i do n't feel like anything is getting stuck right now and i have n't been i have been eating but not as much as i normally would","2095":"doctor: okay okay alright and how are you doing as far as like just emotionally and mentally how are you doing i'm just talking a little bit about your support systems patient: the nursing staff and the office has been very good to help you know with anything that i need as far as support so just since we are just getting started so far on the journey i do feel like i have support and mentally you know still feel strong","2096":"doctor: okay and how about with family or friends have you been able to turn to anyone patient: i do have good family members that have been supportive and they have come to my treatment with me","2097":"doctor: okay excellent excellent and so right now you're on a combination of two different chemotherapies the cisplestan as well as the eupside and you had your last treatment just a few days ago but you're saying right now you've been able to tolerate the nausea and the fatigue patient: yes i have n't had any nausea but you know just slight fatigue it does n't seem to be overwhelming","2098":"doctor: okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far patient: that sounds great thank you","2099":"doctor: okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss patient: great","2100":"doctor: okay any questions for me patient: i do n't believe so at this time","2101":"doctor: okay alright so i'll see you at your next visit patient: great thank you","2102":"doctor: you're welcome and so now just","2103":"doctor: hi kyle how are you today patient: i'm doing well i'm just anxious about my pcp told me that i had some abnormal lab work and why she wanted me to be seen by you today","2104":"doctor: yeah i bet that did make you nervous i i see that she referred you for a low immunoglobulin a level is that your understanding patient: yeah i mean i do n't even really understand what that means but yeah that's what she told me","2105":"doctor: yeah that's a mouthful patient: yeah","2106":"doctor: it it's the the one of the antibodies in your body and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections it's a little bit low i'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you i just have a few more questions okay so let's start again here patient: i'll do this","2107":"doctor: i i think i would break that patient: yeah i just saw that","2108":"doctor: if you can do that patient: okay","2109":"doctor: yeah so we'll we'll just patient: okay","2110":"doctor: you can leave it the way it is for now i just i think break that up patient: okay alright so yeah that sounds fine for me","2111":"doctor: yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections patient: yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual","2112":"doctor: okay how about any abdominal infections patient: diarrhea no","2113":"doctor: frequently patient: no not that i can not that i say can think of","2114":"doctor: okay what about your family are are anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies patient: no my family is actually pretty healthy","2115":"doctor: okay and how about do you have any other medical conditions patient: yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes","2116":"doctor: okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street patient: yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes","2117":"doctor: yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that patient: i know i know","2118":"doctor: but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away patient: right","2119":"doctor: but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products patient: no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally","2120":"doctor: okay where did you go patient: i was in zambia","2121":"doctor: hmmm i heard that's beautiful patient: it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time","2122":"doctor: okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial patient: no","2123":"doctor: no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you patient: yeah so is there anything i need to do or should be watching for or should i be worried","2124":"doctor: no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency patient: why is that","2125":"doctor: well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency patient: okay okay thank you","2126":"doctor: you're welcome patient: okay","2127":"doctor: hey lawrence how're you doing patient: i'm doing alright aside from this elbow pain","2128":"doctor: so it looks like here that you came in to see us today for an evaluation of that right elbow pain can you tell me can you can you tell me well first of all what do you think has been causing that pain patient: so i really during this pandemic i really got into ceramics and doing pottery so i've been doing a lot of pottery and over the past week i then started to develop this elbow pain","2129":"doctor: okay and then so tell me a little bit more about that elbow pain where does it hurt exactly patient: you know it hurts a lot in the inside of my elbow","2130":"doctor: okay so the inside of your right elbow okay patient: yeah","2131":"doctor: and then does the pain radiate down your arm or up into your shoulder or anything like that patient: it does n't go into my shoulder it's it stays mostly at my elbow but it can go down a bit into my forearm","2132":"doctor: okay and then do you remember any trauma did you hit your arm or elbow or any on anything patient: no nothing i i really was trying to think if there is anything else and i ca n't think of anything","2133":"doctor: okay and you've never injured that right elbow before patient: no","2134":"doctor: alright so now let's talk a little bit about your pain and how bad it how bad is that pain on a scale from zero to ten ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life patient: i would say probably a six","2135":"doctor: okay and does that pain keep you up at night patient: it does","2136":"doctor: okay and when you have that kind of pain does it keep you from doing other type of activities patient: yeah i mean i still try to like work through with using my arm but yeah it's it's it's difficult for me sometimes to lift and do things because of that pain","2137":"doctor: okay and then and how long has this pain been going on patient: about four days now","2138":"doctor: alright and anything you've done to help relieve or alleviate that pain any anything that that's giving you relief patient: i've tried ibuprofen that helps a little but not much","2139":"doctor: okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam your vitals look good and i'm gon na do a focused exam on that right elbow i'm gon na go ahead and and and press here do you do you have any pain when i press here patient: yes i do","2140":"doctor: okay so you are positive for pain to palpation you do note that moderate tenderness of the medial epicondyle now i'm gon na have you turn your wrist as if you're turning a door knob do you have any pain when you do that patient: not really","2141":"doctor: okay now turn your wrist in so do you have any pain when you do that patient: yeah that hurts","2142":"doctor: okay so you do have pain you were positive for pain when you pronate that that that forearm okay i'm gon na go ahead and have you rest your arm on the table here palm side up now i want you to raise your hand by bending at the wrist and i'm gon na put some resistance against it do you have any pain when i press against your flexed wrist patient: yes i do","2143":"doctor: alright so you are positive for pain with resistance against flexion of that left wrist so i let let's go ahead and review the x-ray that we did of your elbow the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality of that right elbow which is good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for the problem with elbow pain i do believe that this is consistent with medial epicondylitis which is caused by the overuse and potential damage of those tendons that bend that that bend the wrist towards the palm now i want you to rest it i'm gon na order a sling and i want you to wear the sling while you're awake now we're also gon na have you apply ice to the elbow for twenty minutes three times a day and i want you to take ibuprofen that's gon na be six hundred milligrams q.6 h. with food and i want you to take that for a full week now you're not gon na like this part but i want you to hold off for the next couple of weeks on doing any type of pottery work okay alright now what i wan na do is i wan na see you again in a week and i wan na see how you're doing okay patient: alrighty","2144":"doctor: alrighty so

patient: i've just been eating anything honestly i try to watch it here and there but to tell you the truth i'd looks i was eating","2151":"doctor: yeah i i know it's hard around the holidays and

pressure cuff at home did you end up getting one of those patient: no i have n't got one yet i know i needed to get one","2155":"doctor: yeah that's that will be good if you can take your blood pressures at home and definitely track those what about any problems with shortness of breath lately patient: just like i said when i was walking outside it helped a little bit but again i just walked it off","2156":"doctor: sure any problems sleeping patient: no i sleep like a rock","2157":"doctor: good good to hear have you had any chest pain patient: slightly here or there but i thought it was

david david i'm looking at your results of your echocardiogram that you got when you were in the er and it it does show preserved ejection fraction of fifty five percent and normal diastolic filling and mild to moderate mild to moderate mitral regurgitation so let me tell you about what that means for the chf that you were in the hospital with sounds like you know based on your diet this is likely caused by your dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension that we've been monitoring so what i want you to do is continue your bumex two milligrams once daily definitely stay on top of that make sure that you get those meds in every time i'm gon na write you a consult to nutrition since it sounds like maybe we can give you some advice on on watching your diet definitely watching the

patient: well i've been having this sharp pain on the right side of my abdomen below my ribs for the last several days i saw my doctor and they ordered a cat scan and said i had a kidney stone and sent me to see a urologist","2166":"doctor: okay well does the pain move or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot patient: yeah it feels like it goes to my lower abdomen in into my groin","2167":"doctor: okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go patient: it comes and goes when it comes it's it's pretty it's pretty bad i feel like i ca n't find a comfortable position","2168":"doctor: okay and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee patient: yeah it kinda burns a little bit","2169":"doctor: okay do you notice any blood patient: i do n't think there is any you know frank blood but the urine looks a little dark sometimes","2170":"doctor: okay and what have you taken for the pain patient: i have taken some tylenol but it has n't really helped","2171":"doctor: okay and do you have any nausea vomiting any fever chills patient: i feel nauseated but i'm not vomiting","2172":"doctor: okay is anyone in your in your family had kidney stones patient: yes my father had them","2173":"doctor: and have you had kidney stones before patient: yeah so i i've i've had them but i've been able to pass them but this is taking a lot longer","2174":"doctor: okay well i'm just gon na go ahead and do a physical examination i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm going to explain what what those mean when i'm done okay patient: okay","2175":"doctor: okay so on physical examination of the abdomen on a abdominal exam there is no tenderness to palpation there is no evidence of any rebound or guarding there is no peritoneal signs there is positive cva tenderness on the right flank so essentially what that means russell is that you know you have some tenderness over your over your right kidney and that just means that you might have some inflammation there so i i reviewed the results of the ct scan of your abdomen that the primary care doctor ordered and it does show a . five centimeter kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter so this the ureter is the duct in which urine passes between the kidney and the bladder there's no evidence of what we call hydronephrosis this means you know swelling of the kidney which is good means that things are still able to get through so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan okay so for your first problem of this acute nephrolithiasis or kidney stone i i wan na go ahead and recommend that you push fluids to help facilitate urination and peeing to help pass the stone i'm going to prescribe oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain you can continue to alternate that with some tylenol i'm going to give you a strainer that you can use to strain your urine so that we can see it see the stone when it passes and we can send it for some some tests if that happens i'm also gon na order what we call a basic metabolic panel a urinalysis and a urine culture now i wan na see you again in one to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we'll have to discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shock wave procedure in which we sedate you and use shock waves to break up the stone to help it pass we could also do what we call a ureteroscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureter to retrieve the stone so let's see how you do over the next week and i want you to contact me if you're having worsening symptoms okay patient: okay sounds good thank you","2176":"doctor: hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that patient: yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it","2177":"doctor: okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics patient: i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left","2178":"doctor: okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now patient: yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point","2179":"doctor: okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that patient: yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled","2180":"doctor: okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park patient: yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now","2181":"doctor: absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there patient: i do n't feel that right there","2182":"doctor: okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure patient: no not really so you're gon na continue the antibiotics that i'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic depending on the culture","2183":"doctor: correct patient: if i heard","2184":"doctor: yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy patient: okay sounds good","2185":"doctor: alright","2186":"doctor: hi richard how are you the medical assistant told me that you have a tick bite is that what happened patient: i really do n't know where i got it but i i had i do get out in the woods and i do spend a lot of time

lot of them because i spent a lot of time out of the woods never get into anesthesia takes you can get several bites out of that but this was just one","2198":"doctor: okay alright and have you ever been diagnosed with what we call lyme disease before patient: i have not","2199":"doctor: you have not patient: i would n't know so i would n't know what symptoms are","2200":"doctor: yeah so some of those symptoms like any flu like symptoms have you had like any body aches or chills or anything like that patient: no just really just kind of a a headache just generally do n't feel well","2201":"doctor: generally do n't feel well okay and has that been since the tick bite patient: it has","2202":"doctor: it has okay alright and any other symptoms like a cough or shortness of breath or dizziness or anything like that patient: no","2203":"doctor: okay now since you are here let me just ask you a little bit about your high blood pressure did you buy the blood pressure cuff i asked you to have you been checking your blood pressure at home patient: periodically yes","2204":"doctor: okay and do you think that they are running okay patient: yeah blood pressure seems to be doing okay the lisinopril works well","2205":"doctor: good i was just gon na ask you if you were taking your lisinopril so that's good okay and any side effects from the lisinopril since we started it i think we started it about a year ago two years ago patient: no no no side effects that i'm aware of","2206":"doctor: no side effects okay and then in terms of your diabetes are you watching your sugar intake patient: yeah i usually watch it the form of high what i'm eating but","2207":"doctor: i am a big pie fan as well i know what's your favorite type of pie patient: well you know it's favorite boy i just like pie you know apples cherry chocolate you know bicon","2208":"doctor: i like it too alright are you taking the metformin twice a day patient: not everyday but most of the time","2209":"doctor: okay alright and are you checking your blood sugars pretty regularly patient: i try to","2210":"doctor: okay and do you do you know on average how they're running are they running below like one fifty or patient: yeah it's definitely running below that","2211":"doctor: okay your blood sugars are running below patient: it's it's probably with with with the metformin it seems to be you know one twenty","2212":"doctor: good your blood sugars are running in the one twenties that's really good okay alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good i do think you're doing a good job with taking your lisinopril your blood pressure's about one twenty two over seventy right now which is right where we want it your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty seven again which is right where we want it and i do n't appreciate any fever today you you have a normal temperature at ninety eight . four which is really good so i'm just gon na be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally on your right knee exam i do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance over your right patella now does it hurt when i press patient: it's a little bit sore","2213":"doctor: okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all patient: no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel","2214":"doctor: okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so do you have any questions about that patient: yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just","2215":"doctor: yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound patient: that's fine","2216":"doctor: great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound patient: okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues","2217":"doctor: so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable patient: okay that'd be good","2218":"doctor: okay anything else patient: not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave","2219":"doctor: well you know where to find me okay patient: alright","2220":"doctor: take care bye","2221":"doctor: hi , andrew . how are you ? patient: hey , good to see you

symptoms like muscle aches , joint pain , fatigue ? patient: my elbows hurt quite a bit and my knees were pretty tired . l- like i said , i really felt some tension around my knees , but , uh , i think that was a lot to do with , uh , lifting the bags .","2231":"doctor: okay . all right . um , so , you know , how about , how are you doing in terms of your other medical problems , like your depression ? how are you doing with that ? i know we've , you know , talked about not putting you on medication for it because you're on medication for other things . what's going on ? patient: i- it's been kind of a crazy year and a half . i was a little concerned about that but , for the most part , i've been , been doing well with it . my , my wife got me into barre classes , to help me

you're taking your medication ? patient: yes .","2236":"doctor: okay . all right . well , you know , i know that , you know , you've endorsed , you know , the shortness of breath and some joint pain . um , how about any other symptoms ? nausea or vomiting ? diarrhea ? patient: no .","2237":"doctor: anything like that ? patient: no .","2238":"doctor: okay . all right . well , i wan na go ahead and do a quick physical exam , all right ? hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . so , your vital signs here in the office look quite good . patient: mm-hmm .","2239":"doctor: you know , everything's looking normal , you do n't have a fever , which is really good . um , i'm just gon na go ahead and listen to your heart and your lungs and , kind of , i'll let you know what i hear , okay ? patient: sure .","2240":"doctor: okay . so , on your physical exam , you know , your heart sounds nice and strong . your lungs , you do have scattered ronchi bilaterally on your lung exam . uh , it clears with cough . um , i do notice a little bit of , um , some edema of your lower extremities and you do have some pain to palpation of your elbows bilaterally . um , so , let's go ahead , i want to look at

you know , your hemoglobin a1c is a little elevated at eight . patient: mm-hmm .","2243":"doctor: i'd like to see that a little bit better , around six or seven , if possible . patient: mm-hmm .","2244":"doctor: um , so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you . patient: mm-hmm .","2245":"doctor: so , for your first problem , this upper respiratory infection , i believe you , you have a viral syndrome , okay ? we'll go ahead and we'll send a covid test , just to make sure that you do n't have covid . patient: mm-hmm .","2246":"doctor: uh , but overall , i think that , um , you know , this will resolve in a couple of days . i do n't think you have covid , you do n't have any exposures , that type of thing . patient: mm-hmm .","2247":"doctor: so , i think that this will improve . i'll give you some robitussin for your cough and i would encourage you take some ibuprofen , tylenol for any fever , okay ? patient: you got it .","2248":"doctor: for

patient: yes .","2407":"doctor: does it hurt when i pull your finger like this ? patient: yes .","2408":"doctor: does it hurt when i squeeze over this joint here ? patient: yes . please do n't do that .","2409":"doctor: does it hurt when i squeeze over this ? patient: yes .","2410":"doctor: okay . um ... so with your x-ray , and with your exam , looks like you have a sprain of your distar- distal interphalangeal joint . it's called your dip joint , of your right index finger , and so what we're gon na do for that is we're gon na put a splint on that right finger . i'm gon na give you a strong antiinflammatory called mobic . you'll take 15 milligrams once a day . i'll prescribe 14 of those for you . and i want you to come back and see me in two weeks , and let's make sure it's all healed up and if we need to start any hand therapy at that point , then we can . do you have any questions for me ? patient: no questions . thank you .","2411":"doctor: you're welcome . hey , dragon , order the medications and procedures mentioned . and why do n't you come with me , and we'll get you checked out ? patient: okay .","2412":"doctor: hey , dragon , finalize the report .","2413":"doctor: hi , cheryl . how are you ? patient: i'm doing well . how are you ?","2414":"doctor: i'm doing well . so i know the nurse told you a little bit about dax . i'd like to tell dax about you . patient: okay .","2415":"doctor: cheryl is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension , who presents today with back pain . cheryl , what happened to your back ? patient: so i've been walking a lot lately . i've been walking to ... 30 minutes to an hour or so a day . and all of a sudden , um , when i was walking , my , um , back just kind of seized up on me . and i do n't really know what it was . maybe i was going a little bit faster . but it just all kind of clenched .","2416":"doctor: okay . so you felt like , maybe like a spasm or something like that ? patient: yeah .","2417":"doctor: okay . and how many days ago was that ? patient: that was about six days ago now .","2418":"doctor: okay . and what have you taken for the pain ? patient: i've been taking ibuprofen . um , and then i've been putting some heat on it . but it's still pretty stiff .","2419":"doctor: okay . all right . um , and did you have any trauma before that happened ? were you doing anything strenuous like crossfit or lifting boxes or anything like that before you went for , for the walk ? patient: i have been lifting more , um , probably around three times a week . so i do n't know if it was because i was doing deadlifts that day and then walked .","2420":"doctor: okay . all right . and was it any particular area in your back ? was it the lower back ? patient: yeah , it was .","2421":"doctor: okay . on one side versus the other ? patient: um , kind of both equally .","2422":"doctor: okay . all right . and any numbing or tingling in your legs or your feet ? patient: no , i have n't felt anything like that .","2423":"doctor: okay . any weakness in your lower extremities ? patient: no .","2424":"doctor: okay . all right .and then in terms of your blood pressure , how are you doing ? patient: so i got that cuff that you suggested the ... our ... the last visit , and i've been doing readings at home . and that's been looking great , too . i've been watching my diet . again , my boyfriend's been great and dieting with me so i do n't have to do it alone . and everything's been good .","2425":"doctor: okay . excellent . and you're taking the lisinopril ? patient: yes .","2426":"doctor: okay . wonderful . okay . so i know you did a review of systems sheet with the nurse , and i know you endorse , you know , this back pain . um , do you have any other symptoms ? fever , chills , congestion , cough , chest pain , shortness of breath ? patient: i have a little bit of nasal congestion , but that's just from my seasonal allergies .","2427":"doctor: okay . all right . well , let's go ahead . i want to do a quick physical exam on you . patient: okay .","2428":"doctor: okay ? hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . so good- you know , here in the office , your vital signs look great . your blood pressure's really well controlled , which is good . so that's a good job . so i'm going to take a listen to your heart and lungs . i'm going to examine your back , and i'm going to let you know what i find . okay ? patient: okay .","2429":"doctor: okay . all right . so on physical examination , you know , everything looks good . you know , on your heart exam , i do hear that slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur , but you've had that before . that seems stable to me . on your back exam , you do have some pain to palpation on the right lateral aspect of your lumbar spine , and you do have pain with flexion and extension as well , and you have a negative straight leg raise . so what does that mean ? so we're going to go over that . okay ? let's ... let me look at some of your results , though , first . okay ? patient: okay .","2430":"doctor: we did an x-ray before you saw me , so let's look at that . hey , dragon , show me the back x-ray . so looking here at this x-ray of the lumbar spine , everything looks good . there's good boney alignment . there's no obvious fracture , you know , which is not surprising based on your history . okay ? patient: hmm .","2431":"doctor: hey , dragon , show me the labs . and your labs that we did before you came in all look great . there's no elevated white blood cell count . there's no signs of infection . again , those are all really good . okay ? so let me go over with you about my assessment and my plan for you . so for your first problem , this back pain , i think you have a lumbar strain , and , you know , that might've happened , you know , lifting something or exercising . and so what i want to do is prescribe meloxicam , 15 milligrams once a day . uh , i want you ... you can ice the area , and you can also apply heat sometimes as well . um , you know , i'm going to refer you to physical therapy just to do some strengthening exercises of your back , um , because i do want you to continue to be able to work out and exercise . okay ? patient: okay .","2432":"doctor: and for your last problem , your high blood pressure , again , everything looks great here . um , you know , i think you're doing a really good job with that as well . i want you to continue on the lisinopril , 10 milligrams a day . and then , uh , let me know if you notice any increases in your blood pressure readings . okay ? patient: okay .","2433":"doctor: do you need a refill of the lisinopril ? patient: yes , i do , actually .","2434":"doctor: okay . hey , dragon ? order lisinopril 10 milligrams po daily . okay . uh , so the nurse will be in soon , and she'll get you checked out . okay ? patient: okay .","2435":"doctor: all right . hey , dragon ? finalize the note .","2436":"doctor: um , hi mrs. anderson . right ? patient: yeah . yes , doctor .","2437":"doctor: what brings you here today ? patient: hi , doctor . um , i'm having this left shoulder pain lately , uh , and it's paining a lot .","2438":"doctor: okay . all right . hey , dragon . i am seeing mrs. anderson , a 44-years-old female , uh , complaining to check the left shoulder pain . um , so how long how has this lasted ? patient: it's been a week , doctor . yeah .","2439":"doctor: a week . patient: yeah .","2440":"doctor: um , did you take any medication yourself ? patient: no , i did not take any pain medications . actually , i did . i did take a tylenol for two or three days , but then that did n't help at all . so , uh , the reason why it started or when it started to happen is-","2441":"doctor: yeah , okay . patient: and , uh , i do n't know . maybe i must have toppled over into some weird position , so it started to pain since then , uh , because of a certain move .","2442":"doctor: okay , uh- patient: i went overboard , i think . yeah .","2443":"doctor: all right , lem me , uh , take a quick look . uh , can you move up a little bit ? yeah . patient: uh , yeah . in fact , that's hurts .","2444":"doctor: does that- does it hurt ? patient: yeah , it does .","2445":"doctor: what if you move back a little bit ? patient: uh , that also hurts , doctor .","2446":"doctor: yeah , okay . patient: any kind of movement on my left shoulder actually hurts .","2447":"doctor: okay . all right , um , so let's ... hey , dragon . show me the last x-ray . all right , from the x-ray , it does n't look like there is any , uh , broken bone or fracture . my guess is you probably , um , hurt your joint , uh- patient: uh- .","2448":"doctor: . a little bit . patient: mm-hmm .","2449":"doctor: so i would , uh , suggest you continue using the pain reliever , maybe just like 600 milligram of ibuprofen three times a day and use it for a week . patient: and for how long ? yes .","2450":"doctor: for a week . patient: a week , okay .","2451":"doctor: and then if you ... if it's still painful , you can use , uh , ice or , um , heat pad- patient: okay .","2452":"doctor: . 'cause that might help relieve your pain . patient: okay .","2453":"doctor: mm-hmm . patient: . so , um , i hope that should n't matter , right ?","2454":"doctor: um , that does n't seem related to your pain . patient: okay .","2455":"doctor: so ... but i would try to rest my , your left arm- patient: okay .","2456":"doctor: . while it's healing . patient: okay .","2457":"doctor: so , um- patient: can i , uh , carry any heavy weights or-","2458":"doctor: no , no . definitely not . patient: . anything like that ?","2459":"doctor: definitely not . patient: okay . okay .","2460":"doctor: yeah , use , um , right hand- patient: okay .","2461":"doctor: . instead- patient: mm-hmm .","2462":"doctor: . for the next , uh , at least just three to four weeks . patient: mm-hmm .","2463":"doctor: uh , come back to see me if the pain , you know , still there after maybe three weeks- patient: sure .","2464":"doctor: . so we can take a further look . patient: okay . sure .","2465":"doctor: but you should be fine- patient: yeah .","2466":"doctor: . after just resting and regular pain reliever . patient: okay . all right .","2467":"doctor: um , maybe . let's see how you're doing in the next three weeks . patient: uh .","2468":"doctor: hey , dragon . um , order medications and procedures as discussed . all right . patient: okay .","2469":"doctor: um , i think that's good for today . hope you feel better soon . patient: okay . thank you , doctor .","2470":"doctor: um , you can also try advil . patient: okay .","2471":"doctor: yeah , so , um ... patient: yeah .","2472":"doctor: ale- , aleve . i mean , aleve . patient: i see . okay , thank you , doctor .","2473":"doctor: thank you .","2474":"doctor: elizabeth , how are you ? patient: i'm doing okay . how are you ?","2475":"doctor: doing okay . so i know the nurse told you about dax . i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you , okay ? patient: okay .","2476":"doctor: all right . elizabeth is a 66-year-old female with a past medical history of significant for depression and hypertension who presents for her annual exam . so elizabeth , it's been a year since i've seen you . patient: mm-hmm .","2477":"doctor: how are you doing ? patient: i'm doing well . there's been so many events now that we've been able to get vaccinated , i've been able to see my grandkids again , go to more birthday parties , it's been fantastic .","2478":"doctor: yeah , i know . i've ... i mean , we've had some communication over telehealth and that type of thing , but it's not the same as being in-person , so i'm happy to see you today . now tell me a little bit about , you know , we have n't really got a chance to talk about your depression . how are you ... how are you doing with that ? i know we have n't had you on medication in the past because you're on medication for other things . what are your strategies with dealing with it ? patient: so i've been going to therapy once a week for the past year . um , mostly virtually , um , but starting to get in-person . virtual was a bit of a struggle , but i feel like being in-person with someone really helps me .","2479":"doctor: okay . and do y- do you have a good support system at home ? patient: yes , i do . i have my husband and , uh , my kids are right down the street from me , so i'm very lucky .","2480":"doctor: okay . all right . so that's good to hear . how about your blood pressure ? did you buy the blood pressure cuff that i- patient: yes .","2481":"doctor: . told you to ? okay . i know that we've been in communication and your blood pressures have been running okay . the last time i spoke with you , how are they doing since we last spoke ? patient: they've been doing well . i've been using the cuff , um , once a day , and they seem pretty normal .","2482":"doctor: okay . and are you taking the lisinopril that i prescribed ? patient: yes .","2483":"doctor: okay . great . all right . so i know that you did a review of systems sheet with the nurse when you checked in . you know , i know that you were talking about some nasal congestion . do you have any other symptoms , chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , anything like that ? patient: no .","2484":"doctor: no ? okay . all right . well , i wan na go ahead and do a quick physical exam , okay ? patient: okay .","2485":"doctor: hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . so here in the office , you know , your blood pressure looks really good , as does your heart rate . so you are doing a good job managing your blood pressure . so i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , okay ? patient: okay .","2486":"doctor: okay . so on physical examination , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits in your neck . on your heart exam i do notice a slight 2\/6 systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past , so i think that's stable . your lungs in- are nice and clear , and you have some trace lower extremity edema bilaterally , so all that means is , you know , i agree , you know , maybe we should watch your diet a little bit better , okay ? but i wan na take a look at some of your results , okay ? patient: okay .","2487":"doctor: all right . hey , dragon , show me the ekg . and the nurses did an ekg before you came in , and that looks perfectly fine , okay ? so i wan na just go ahead and talk a little about your assessment and my plan for you . so for your first problem , your depression , i think you're doing a really good job with your strategies . i do n't think ... it does n't sound to me like i need to start you on any medication at this time , unless you feel differently . patient: no , i'm , i'm , good in that department .","2488":"doctor: for your second problem , your high blood pressure , i agree , everything looks fine here now . i wan na just continue on the lisinopril , 20 milligrams a day . and i want you to continue to watch your blood pressures as well , and if they start rising , i want you to contact me , okay ? patient: okay .","2489":"doctor: and for your third problem , for an annual exam maintenance , you know , you're due for a mammogram , so we'll go ahead and schedule that , okay ? patient: all right .","2490":"doctor: all right . do you have any questions ? patient: um , can i take all my medicine at the same time ? does it matter ?","2491":"doctor: yeah . you can set an alarm so that it reminds you to take your medication . but yeah , you can , you can take them altogether . patient: okay .","2492":"doctor: all right . hey , dragon , finalize the note .","2493":"doctor: all right . today i am seeing jose james . uh , date of birth 9\/29\/1957 . mr . james is a new patient who's having pain in his left shoulder and elbow . he fell five months ago going up a stairs , and the pain has been present since . hi mr . james , i'm doctor isabella . how are you doing ? patient: i'm okay . thank you .","2494":"doctor: that's good . that's good . tell me what's brings you in today . patient: sure . so i've been having constant pain in my left shoulder and left elbow for a while , about five months or so . hurts all the time . pretty bad at times .","2495":"doctor: mm . that does not sound like fun . it sounds like you injured it going up the stairs ? patient: yes , that's correct . it was icy , and i have to walk up a flight of stairs to my house . i stepped and my feet just went out . fell on my left side . seems like my shoulder and wrist took the brunt . it's been hurting since .","2496":"doctor: yeah , that does seem like a likely cause of your symptoms . anything seem to make the pain worse ? patient: well , i've always hit the gym and lifted weights . i've been trying to keep with my routine of two days a week , but it's been hard . the pain is worse when i lift , and i have n't been able to lift more than 15 or 20 pounds which is very frustrating .","2497":"doctor: mm-hmm . i can imagine it is when you're so accustomed to your routine . patient: exactly . i really enjoy my exercise , but over the past one to two weeks , i've stopped hitting the gym because the pain just was n't worth it honestly . i do keep up with my walking , though . my wife and i walk about 30 minutes almost every day . we have done this since i retired from my office job last year .","2498":"doctor: i do not blame you , mr . james . does anything seem to help the pain that you've tried ? patient: not too much . i have iced a bit , but i have not taken anything for the pain . stopping exercise and some ice has helped a bit , but it still hurts enough for me to come to see you .","2499":"doctor: yeah , okay . how about any numbness or tingling ? have you felt that at any point ? patient: no , doc . just pain . no tingling or numbless , numbness , thankfully .","2500":"doctor: understood . understood . all right . well , let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on . patient: sounds good . thank you .","2501":"doctor: okay . use my general physical exam template . mr . james , i'm going to gently press around your shoulder and elbow here to see where your pain might be stemming from . just let me know when it hurts . patient: okay . it hurts when you press there on my elbow and here on my shoulder .","2502":"doctor: okay . left shoulder and elbow , tender sa space , no warmth , erythema or deformity . positive hawkins-kennedy and neer's test . normal proximal and distar , distal upper extremity strength . intact median radial ulnar sensation and abduction to 90 degrees . normal empty tan , can test . okay , mr . james , w-what i think you are dealing with is impingement syndrome of your left shoulder . i do n't think there's an additional injury or issue with your wrist , but because everything is connected , you're experiencing pain in your wrist because of your shoulder . we do see this type of issue when someone has a fall , so it's good you came to see us , you came in to see us so we could help . patient: so what are the possible treatments ?","2503":"doctor: well , we have a few options you can try . first option would be to start with physical therapy . i would recommend two sessions per week as well as any other exercises they give you to do at home . we can start there and if that does n't improve your pain , then we could try a cortisone injection . patient: i like the idea of starting with the physical therapy and have a next step if it does n't help . i am not opposed to a shot but would like to try the therapy first .","2504":"doctor: all right . great . i'll get a referral order , and they will call you within the next day or two to get you scheduled . patient: okay .","2505":"doctor: mm-hmm . also , please continue to ice , especially your shoulder , and rest as much as you can . patient: okay . i will .","2506":"doctor: give us a call or email us if you have symptoms worsen , if your symptoms worsen or do not improve with the therapy . patient: will do . thank you . i appreciate your help .","2507":"doctor: you're welcome . have a great day . patient: you too .","2508":"doctor: all right . assessment is impingement syndrome of left shoulder . plan discussed with patient . referral is requested for dr. martha rivera to be in physical therapy two days per week .","2509":"doctor: next patient is randy gutierrez . date of birth , 8\/10\/2020 . please use review of symptoms . all text to write . physical exam , auto text uri . hello , how are you doing today ? patient_guest: we're okay , thank you .","2510":"doctor: that's good to hear . so , how many days has randy been feeling sick ? patient_guest: well , i would say it started around supper time last night .","2511":"doctor: last night , okay , and what's been going on ? patient_guest: well , he started to get a runny nose .","2512":"doctor: okay , and is he stuffy too ? patient_guest: yeah . yeah .","2513":"doctor: okay , and have you noticed , is his mucous clear right now ? patient_guest: it is , it is right now , yes .","2514":"doctor: okay . and , does he also have a cough ? patient_guest: yes , but it's not barky .","2515":"doctor: and does he act like he has a sore throat or is he pulling on his ears ? patient_guest: well , i know he's been pulling on his ears , yeah .","2516":"doctor: okay . patient_guest: you know , he also , he's also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too .","2517":"doctor: okay . and , any fever you've noticed ? patient_guest: i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 .","2518":"doctor: okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ? patient_guest: yes , he did . yeah .","2519":"doctor: and how about this morning ? did he eat his breakfast ? patient_guest: uh , this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle .","2520":"doctor: okay . patient_guest: and then he got another bottle , and he barely ate that . um , i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either .","2521":"doctor: okay . patient_guest: so , he varies i guess .","2522":"doctor: how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps , or does he have pretty good energy ? patient_guest: mmm , it seems like he's irritable .","2523":"doctor: irritable because he is n't feeling good ? patient_guest: yeah . he is energetic , but it seems like he ca n't go to sleep , like , he's fighting it really hard .","2524":"doctor: okay , and just for the chart , is there anyone , anybody else exposed to him who has been sick ? patient_guest: yes , his older sister's been sick .","2525":"doctor: thank you . patient_guest: we also had a play date with my nephew , who i learned later had a sinus infection .","2526":"doctor: and what medication have you tried for him ? anything at all ? patient_guest: um , i've been doing the saline mist in his nose .","2527":"doctor: good , good . that's a good choice . patient_guest: i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him , and we had the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating .","2528":"doctor: i see . and , any other medications ? patient_guest: we did put some baby vick's on his feet last night to try and help him breathe . and , i also used the humidifier .","2529":"doctor: okay . that's good . patient_guest: okay . okay .","2530":"doctor: so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ? patient_guest: i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo .","2531":"doctor: is it a dandruff shampoo ? patient_guest: no , i do n't think so .","2532":"doctor: okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps . patient_guest: okay , sounds good .","2533":"doctor: can you take a big breath randy . patient_guest: where's mama ?","2534":"doctor: do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too . patient_guest: yeah , it's okay buddy .","2535":"doctor: excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears . patient_guest: okay .","2536":"doctor: let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over . patient_guest: dino , you're doing so good .","2537":"doctor: all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down . patient_guest: hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .","2538":"doctor: okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like . patient_guest: all right . thank you .","2539":"doctor: all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine . you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus . patient_guest: okay .","2540":"doctor: actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well . patient_guest: okay . okay .","2541":"doctor: but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough . patient_guest: mm-hmm , got it .","2542":"doctor: okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough . patient_guest: i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?","2543":"doctor: yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby . patient_guest: okay .","2544":"doctor: now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine . patient_guest: okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .","2545":"doctor: yes , zarbee's . patient_guest: and then you said , uh , which medicine to give him just in case ?","2546":"doctor: i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand . patient_guest: okay .","2547":"doctor: right , does that make sense ? patient_guest: yeah , yeah . that makes sense .","2548":"doctor: okay , great . and that way you do n't have to share , um , with his sister . patient_guest: right , okay .","2549":"doctor: and since he's about half her size , we'll do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon . patient_guest: okay . will this information all be in the papers ?","2550":"doctor: yes . and so , if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for five days . patient_guest: okay .","2551":"doctor: yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is , \" as needed , \" or anything like that . patient_guest: mm-hmm , understood , thank you .","2552":"doctor: you're welcome . patient_guest: and the cradle cap ?","2553":"doctor: what i would do is use something like either head & shoulder's , or selsun blue , or nizoral ad . now , do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . um , cradle cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff . so , those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing 'cause they , um , they are all dead scales , and you still have to brush them off . so , continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil , or something that will help get the scales out , and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not every day , but maybe twice a week . so , two days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then , often , within six weeks or so , you'll notice that the-the cradle cap is just , um , not coming back anymore . but , he has to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes . so , just make sure when you're rinsing his hair you avoid his eyes . patient_guest: okay . okay .","2554":"doctor: all right . and , if it keeps getting worse , definitely let us know . patient_guest: okay . sounds good .","2555":"doctor: good . and , since they do n't have covid-19 , you can go right ahead and check out . patient_guest: okay . and both appointments in the week ?","2556":"doctor: correct . we'll see you all then . bye randy , feel better . patient_guest: all right , great . thank you so much .","2557":"doctor: you are welcome , and have a good rest of your day .","2558":"doctor: kayla ward , date of birth , 4\/28\/07 . mrn 3-8-4-9-2-0 . she's here for a new visit with her mother for acne located on the face , which started about two years ago and is present most every day . she has been using persa-gel and washing regularly , which is somewhat helpful . there are no associated symptoms including itching , bleeding , or pain . no additional past medical history . she lives with her parents and sister . they have a dog , bird , and bunnies . she is in 7th grade . she plays basketball and volleyball and tap . she wears sunscreen in the summer , spf 30 . no additional family history . hi kayla , i'm dr. juan price . i hear you are starting to get some acne on the face . how about the chest and back ? patient: it's not too bad .","2559":"doctor: so , it's not bad on the chest or back . you've used some over the counter items like washes and persa-gel ? patient: yeah .","2560":"doctor: do those seem to be helping ? patient: yes , i think so , a little bit .","2561":"doctor: good . what's your skin care routine like now ? patient: do you wan na know , like , the things i currently use ?","2562":"doctor: yes . what do you do for your acne in the morning ? and then what do you do at nighttime ? patient: i wash my face , more like i wipe it down in the morning . then at night i use an elf facial cleanser called the super clarity cleanser . i finish with a toner and then the persa-gel .","2563":"doctor: when you say , \" wipe your face in the morning , \" do you use a product or just water ? patient: mm , just water and a washcloth , really . if i feel really greasy , sometimes i'll use the elf cleanser in the morning , too .","2564":"doctor: okay . and is today a good day , bad day , or an average day for you ? patient: mm , i would say it's probably a good day for me , of course , since i'm here , right ?","2565":"doctor: acne is always good when you come to see the doctor . do you find that your acne flares with your periods ? patient: no , not really .","2566":"doctor: and do you get a regular period ? patient: yup .","2567":"doctor: how long have you been getting a regular period ? patient: mm , i think about two years .","2568":"doctor: okay . patient_guest: the biggest flare , probably , was when she started school sports in the fall , just with all the sweating .","2569":"doctor: yup , that will do it . is there anything else that you've noticed , mrs. ward ? patient_guest: no . kayla really has been doing a good job with the facial care regimen . it just does n't seem to help as much as we wanted .","2570":"doctor: got it . okay . well , let's take a look then . full exam is performed today , except for under the underwear and under the bra . multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities . scattered skin colored papules . open and closed comedones . and erythmateous papules on the face , primarily on the forehead and with also some on the central cheeks and chin . the chest and back are relatively spared . and the remainder of the examination is normal . so , what i'm seeing from your exam today is mild to moderate acne , mostly comodonal with small inflammatory component . patient: okay , so is there anything we can do to help it ?","2571":"doctor: yes . i would like to start with a topical therapy first . every morning , you will wash your face with a mild cleanser then use a moisturizer labeled , \" noncomedogenic , \" with sunscreen spf 30 or higher . this means it wo n't clog your pores . now , in the evening , wash your face with the same cleanser and allow it to dry . apply adapalene , 0.1 % cream , in a thin layer to the areas you generally get acne . i want you to start off using this a few nights a week and slowly work up to using it every night . if it is ... excuse me , if it is very expensive or not covered by insurance , you can try different gel over the counter . you can follow that with clean and clear persa-gel in a thin layer , or where you generally get acne . and then a noncomedogenic moisturizer . you're atopic retinoid will cause some sensitivity , so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside . it may also cause some dryness or irritation . patient: okay , i can do that .","2572":"doctor: you also have multiple benign moles on your arms , legs , back and abdomen . this means they all look normal with no worrisome features . we will see if you have any progress over the next six months and follow up at that time . patient: okay , that sounds good . thank you .","2573":"doctor: do you have any questions for me ? patient: no , i do n't think so .","2574":"doctor: okay . if you have questions or concerns before your next visit , please call the office . patient: thank you , doctor , we will .","2575":"doctor: patient is julia jones , date of birth 5\/16\/1996 . she is a new breast reduction consult . hello , how are you doing today ? i'm dr. gonzalez . it's nice to meet you . patient: nice to meet you , ma'am . how are you ?","2576":"doctor: i'm doing good , thank you . so you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ? patient: yes . that's right .","2577":"doctor: okay . perfect . let me just get logged in , here . have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ? patient: no , i have n't .","2578":"doctor: okay . and how long have you been considering this ? patient: it's probably been about six or seven years . but i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .","2579":"doctor: well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure . patient: okay , that's reassuring .","2580":"doctor: yeah . so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having . and then i'll do a quick exam . patient: okay . that sounds good .","2581":"doctor: and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails . and , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ? patient: i have blue cross blue shield . well , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .","2582":"doctor: okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company . and what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not . but we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you'll be on the new plan ? patient: most likely july .","2583":"doctor: okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time . patient: okay .","2584":"doctor: so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ? patient: well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . i do have a lotta pain here and here . but i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not . it gets painful and builds up . so i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .","2585":"doctor: okay . and in your neck and your upper back . and how long has this been going on ? would you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ? patient: i would say since i was in high school .","2586":"doctor: okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup . patient: yes . i do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often . i mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable . and the others are expensive in my size .","2587":"doctor: yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ? patient: no , i do not have any kids now . but we might plan to in the future .","2588":"doctor: okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ? patient: sometimes , yes .","2589":"doctor: okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating . patient: no , but they are always sweaty .","2590":"doctor: okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ? patient: there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts .","2591":"doctor: and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ? patient: y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .","2592":"doctor: that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ? patient: mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .","2593":"doctor: okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ? patient: yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .","2594":"doctor: congratulations . that's great . and then , um- patient: thank you .","2595":"doctor: . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ? patient: uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .","2596":"doctor: okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other . patient: yeah .","2597":"doctor: okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now . patient: okay .","2598":"doctor: so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast . patient: okay . that's fine .","2599":"doctor: and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well . patient: right .","2600":"doctor: so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery . patient: okay . well , thank you for explaining that .","2601":"doctor: you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you . patient: okay .","2602":"doctor: and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line . patient: okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .","2603":"doctor: okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility . patient: okay , yeah , that sounds good .","2604":"doctor: okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breastfeed after a breast reduction , and the reason is the breast is made up of fat . and it's also made up of a gland . and the gland is what produces the milk . patient: okay .","2605":"doctor: and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that . patient: yeah , okay .","2606":"doctor: and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated . patient: yeah . i do n't know if i'm interested in breastfeeding .","2607":"doctor: okay . um , the hormones of pregnancy , though , will change the breasts , so that's just something to be aware of , and i tell all younger patients that . patient: okay , yeah . absolutely .","2608":"doctor: and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you'll have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple . generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction . and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised , and then it just takes some time for that to go away . patient: yeah , okay .","2609":"doctor: but other than that , you know , most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because the symptoms of the back pain , the neck pain , you can feel relief almost immediately . so do you have any questions , julia , about the process or anything like that ? patient: no , not really .","2610":"doctor: okay . and , i do think you're a good candidate for it . and i think you'll benefit from it as well . patient: good . i look forward to a relief .","2611":"doctor: i think you just have to do it when you are ready , when you know that you feel like it's a good time , because it is a commitment , and you will have some activity restrictions for about six weeks after surgery , uh , no heavy lifting . and i do say no driving for two to three weeks . and the drains stay in , like i said , for about a week . patient: okay . well , i am ready as soon as my insurance is switched over .","2612":"doctor: okay . well , i think from this point , if you want to , we can take photos today , while you're here . i have all the documentation now in the note about your symptoms , and that's what the insurance company is going to look for . so thank you for answering those questions . so once we have the new provider , we'll go ahead and get that submitted . and then , when they approve it , um , what the office will do , is they'll work with you on a surgery date , and then we'll meet again right before the surgery to answer any last minute questions and go over the instructions in more detail , things like that . patient: okay . well , i will notify the office as soon as i have the insurance information .","2613":"doctor: that sounds great . and then we can get it all in process . and it was so nice to meet you . and catherine will be right in to get your photos . julia jones is a 25 year old female with symptomatic macromastia , presenting for evaluation of breast reduction . the patient has attempted nonsurgical treatments , but the minimal relief , and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty . her minimum required resection , based on a bsa of 2.65 , with the schnur scale is 1,792 grams , which should be attainable . given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above , there is potential for using a nipple graft . physical exam findings of breast , inspection reveals asymmetrical breasts with severe ptosis bilaterally . there is no nipple retraction or discharge bilaterally . no breast tenderness , masses , or axillary lymphadenopathy is palpable .","2614":"doctor: kelly wood . date of birth , february 15th , 1979 . established patient here for renal ultrasound because of hematuria . urine dipstick today . negative for leukocytes , nitrates , protein , ketone , bilirubin and glucose . color yellow and clear , urobilinogen 0.2 , ph 5.5 and specific gravity 1.020 . there is a trace amount of blood in the urine and intact . renal ultrasound impression . right kidney is 10 cm in length by five centimeter wide . there are no stones , masses or hydronephrosis . the left kidney is 10.8 centimeters in length and five centimeters wide . there is a six millimeter left renal stone non-obstructing . 533 milliliters pre-void and 0 milliliters post-void . hi , mrs. wood . i see you're just finished your ultrasound . patient: yes , ma'am .","2615":"doctor: well , it looks like you have one stone in the left kidney but it's not obstructing anything . patient: i knew it had to be a kidney stone . i passed what looked like two small stones last week after i scheduled this appointment . and then for the past six weeks , i've had a few episodes of bright red urine the color of , like , cherry kool-aid . and last week , i was constantly having to pee and it hurt something terrible .","2616":"doctor: how bad was your pain on a scale of zero to 10 ? zero being no pain and 10 being worse , as you can imagine . patient: um , at the time , i'd say an eight .","2617":"doctor: are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back ? patient: no , after passing those stones , things have felt a lot better .","2618":"doctor: that's good to hear . now , it looks like you're only taking alavert 10 milligrams a day and have no drug allergies . is that correct ? patient: that's right .","2619":"doctor: all right , let's take a look at you today . let's use my default pe . well , mrs. wood , we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones . fortunately , you passed two last week and the blood has nearly subsided . you do still have one stone in the left kidney . since it's not obstructing or causing pain , i do n't recommend any surgical intervention at this time . patient: i'd like to know what i can do to stop getting these stones .","2620":"doctor: as we discussed last time , the formation of kidney stones can not be attributed to a particular cause . but several factors increase the risk , such as dehydration , family history , certain foods , digestive tract disease and certain medical conditions . patient: yeah , i know i do n't drink near the amount of water that i should . i drink more mountain dew than anything .","2621":"doctor: you should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day . patient: so , if i weight 250 pounds , i should drink ?","2622":"doctor: that would be 125 ounces of water a day and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like mountain dew . patient: okay . is there any food i should n't eat ?","2623":"doctor: great question . you should avoid food rich in sodium oxalate and animal protein . so that would be salty , processed food because they're high in sodium . ideally , you should consume less than 1,000 milligrams of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef , poultry , fish , and pork . patient: what's oxalate ?","2624":"doctor: it's an organic acid found in plants , that when digested , it binds to minerals that stones are formed from . foods like spinach , chocolate , beets , rhubarb and soy products . patient: well , i'll do whatever it takes to try to avoid getting these stones again .","2625":"doctor: great . and here's a handout that you can look over . it goes over the dietary recommendations and what to avoid . patient: okay , good . i like to have things in writing to help me remember .","2626":"doctor: perfect . well , if you have any more questions . if you do n't have any more questions , you're all set . i wo n't need to see you back until next year , as long as you do n't have any more issues like bleeding or pain . if you do have any issues , you can always call the office sooner . and if you experience any severe pain or bright red blood in your urine , you should go to the emergency room . patient: all right . well , let's hope we do n't have to do either of those and i see you next year .","2627":"doctor: yes , let's hope . come right this way and i'll walk you to check out . update pe abdomen . no flank pain . anti gu . normal vaginal exam . primary diagnosis is hematuria . secondary diagnosis is chronic urol ... urolithiasis . thank you . this completes mrs. wood encounter .","2628":"doctor: next patient is melissa sanchez . date of birth , 9\/23\/1962 . mrn : 5484367 . she is being seen in office today for status post mitral valve repair done on 8\/3\/2020 . at her previous follow-up on 9\/17 , we felt that she was doing quite well from a cardiac standpoint , and so we recommended she continue with the same medication . ecg taken on 12\/26\/2020 reveals atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response . t-wave inversion anteriorly . compared to the previous study , there are no significant changes , and please add in the history , patient has a history of mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation , history of diabetes , asthma , and recurrent chest discomfort with negative cardiac workup for coronary artery disease . ms. sanchez , it's good to see you again . patient: yeah , it's good seeing you too dr. hughes . you look like you're doing well .","2629":"doctor: i am , thank you . you too . you're looking great . how have you been feeling ? patient: pretty good . i'm definitely feeling better , thank goodness . i was having a rough time before surgery , um , but i think i'm overall pretty good now though .","2630":"doctor: okay . well , that's really good to hear . i'm glad . are you having any new symptoms right now ? patient: no , not really . but , you know , i'm still getting some chest pains sometimes , and my breathing gets shallow . but , i guess i'm learning what i can and ca n't do . uh , so if i feel like that , if i'm , like , exerting myself , i slow down a bit which helps , and then when i go back to it later , i can usually finish whatever i was doing .","2631":"doctor: okay . so , it does go away though ? how long does an episode seem to last ? patient: uh , only a few minutes i guess . then it disappears for a while . it's weird .","2632":"doctor: what is a while ? patient: it goes away for a couple weeks . um , so when it happens , i just take the day nice and slow , i do n't push myself .","2633":"doctor: okay . so , maybe it's a couple times a month you feel this way ? patient: yeah , just often enough for me to notice .","2634":"doctor: understood . okay . are you taking your medications regularly ? patient: uh- . i've been trying to keep up with that . there's a lot of extra pills now , but i have a reminder app , so i do pretty well .","2635":"doctor: okay . that's great . and so , you're taking coumadin , right ? patient: yeah , also lasix and the atenolol .","2636":"doctor: are you having any side effects from the medications at all ? patient: not really . uh , i notice that the atenolol is making me irritable in the beginning , but i guess i've gotten used to it , does n't seem to bother me as much now .","2637":"doctor: okay . well , that sounds good . sounds like you're well on the mend . so , why do n't i start out , um , with the physical exam , and just check you out . patient: okay .","2638":"doctor: you're going to hear me describe things in detail or repeat things as i go to reference later for my notes . patient: okay .","2639":"doctor: okay then . i'm going to be using my status post template , ms. sanchez , please lie down on the table here and we'll get started . all right . can you turn your head to the left . head and neck no jvd detected . you can turn back now and just take a couple of deep breaths for me please . okay , that's good . and lungs have reduced breath , but auscultation and percussion are clear . okay . breath normally , i'm just going to listen to your heart . rhythm is irregularly irregular . patient: that's a funny statement . what does that mean ?","2640":"doctor: yeah , it does sounds kind of weird , right ? it's when your heart does n't beat with the correct rhythm , and whatever rhythm it does n't have a pattern to it . so , it's part of the atrial fibrillation . patient: wow , that sounds like a mess .","2641":"doctor: yeah , it's not ideal . but , many people have a-fib are able to keep it under control with medicine and lifestyle changes . patient: agh , i see . that's good to know .","2642":"doctor: okay . so , s1 slightly accentuated , no s3 . i'm going to touch your belly , and does any of that hurt . patient: nope .","2643":"doctor: how about there ? and your feet ? patient: no , not really .","2644":"doctor: okay , great . and trace peripheral edema on extremities . all right ms. sanchez , you can sit up now . so , it looks like your heart valves are working well and you are recovering from the surgery nicely . patient: good .","2645":"doctor: yes . we are , we looked at your ecg taken earlier today , and we are seeing the a-fib , but it's being well controlled with the medicine , and you're taking coumadin , four milligrams , lasix at four milligrams a day , and the atenolol , you're taking that every day as well , right ? patient: yes . the 50 milligrams every day .","2646":"doctor: great . it sounds like you're well on your way to recovery . patient: great .","2647":"doctor: so , let's continue on your current meds . i'm glad that you're figuring out what your body can handle . definitely try to keep active as that will certainly help . patient: i'll do my best .","2648":"doctor: and that's about it . do you have any questions for me ? patient: um , i do . when do i need to come back and get checked out ?","2649":"doctor: well , i do n't think you need to come back soon . everything from a cardio perspective is fine . so , i think let's do a followup in about six to nine months . patient: all right , thank you . it was good to see you again dr. hughes .","2650":"doctor: you as well ms. sanchez , do take care . patient: you too .","2651":"doctor: judy

how are you ?","2652":"doctor: i'm great , thanks . so how have you been since the last time ? i know the last time we were talking about decreasing your prednisone dose , correct ? patient: yes . i'm just on one now and that seems to be enough .","2653":"doctor: aw , that's great to hear . patient: yeah , there were a couple days there i took an extra one , just because there was a little extra pain in my feet . and i do have a desk job , so when i have a day off where i'm moving around a lot they do tend to hurt a bit more .","2654":"doctor: okay . how many times did you do that ? patient: um , it was n't often , maybe once a week .","2655":"doctor: okay . so it sounds like we're still on track for discontinuing the prednisone . we'll do that today and you can let me know how it goes on your next visit . and how about the methotrexate , do you think that helped with your joint pain ? patient: yeah , definitely . because i went to get my covid shots , um , but from the letter i got about it , it said that it could interfere with the vaccine , you know , reduce the efficacy . so i did n't take it on the week that i got the first shot .","2656":"doctor: okay . and what happened ? patient: i felt absolutely horrible until i took it again a week later .","2657":"doctor: i'm sorry to hear that . and- and what did you do about the second dose ? patient: well , i called into the hotline because i was in so much pain with the first one . and they said , \" no , just go ahead and take it , \" so i did .","2658":"doctor: okay . that's good then . we do have to keep an eye out on it since it's a high-risk medication . do you have an appointment to get your blood drawn for the next time ? patient: no , they did n't give me one .","2659":"doctor: okay . so we can do that for you too . uhm , so what questions do you have for me , judy ? patient: well , i just wanted to know why i was getting all these bruises here , so like when i bump myself . i do n't know where they're coming from .","2660":"doctor: okay . that's probably from the prednisone , it can increase bruising . patient: okay . i did n't know that . um , i do n't even feel it when it happens , they just show up .","2661":"doctor: yeah . unfortunately that can happen , but we're working on discontinuing that so let's see if the bruises do go away . patient: okay . that sounds good , thanks .","2662":"doctor: okay , judy , please , um , sit up here and i'll take a look . shoes and socks off please . patient: all right .","2663":"doctor: all right . let me see here . okay . so where is it hurting ? in your joints right here ? patient: yeah , a little . also in my feet joints as well .","2664":"doctor: okay . and how about when you bend the knee like this ? patient: well , it hurt before we increased the methotrexate , but it's doing pretty good now .","2665":"doctor: okay , good . can you flex your toes please ? good range of motion . also ridges in nails , that's from the psoriasis . patient: yeah . they've been like that for a long time now .","2666":"doctor: okay . all right , uhm , ms gomez , it looks like we're moving along with your treatment nicely . we'll stop your prednisone and continue with the methotrexate . make sure to stop by the front desk and make an appointment for the blood work , and i'll see you in three months . patient: all right . it sounds good . thank you so much , it was great to see you .","2667":"doctor: it was great seeing you too . thank you .","2668":"doctor: patient's name is diana scott . date of birth , 12\/8\/1920 . the date of service is 7\/9\/2021 . this is a new patient note . good afternoon . how are you today ? patient: i'm good , thank you .","2669":"doctor: good . well , what brings you in to see me today ? patient: well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur .","2670":"doctor: okay . so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ? patient: yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur . so of course , i'm worried as well .","2671":"doctor: got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ? patient: i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having .","2672":"doctor: okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one . so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ? patient: no , i definitely do n't .","2673":"doctor: okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ? patient: no , i do n't have any chest pain . um , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .","2674":"doctor: okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ? patient: if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .","2675":"doctor: okay . and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ? patient: well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know . maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .","2676":"doctor: got it . all right . patient: so it is n't that bothersome to me at all . um , maybe more if i try to overdo it .","2677":"doctor: okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ? patient: i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago . before that i did n't notice anything at all .","2678":"doctor: okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ? patient: my legs have been severe for about a month now .","2679":"doctor: okay . and how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ? patient: yeah . so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .","2680":"doctor: okay . and so how about any passing out at all ? patient: no .","2681":"doctor: okay , good . and how about irregular heartbeats ? do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ? patient: i do n't notice it at all .","2682":"doctor: okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ? patient: yeah , my ankles swell .","2683":"doctor: okay . and how long has this been going on ? patient: um , i would say for probably six months . but it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .","2684":"doctor: okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ? patient: um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .","2685":"doctor: mm-hmm . okay . patient: um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .","2686":"doctor: okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ? patient: no .","2687":"doctor: good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ? patient: yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .","2688":"doctor: okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ? patient: i'm not really sure .","2689":"doctor: okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ? patient: yeah , you name it .","2690":"doctor: all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ? patient: yes .","2691":"doctor: okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ? patient: it was actually my son , not my brother .","2692":"doctor: okay , i'll make that adjustment . patient: um , but my brother did have a stroke . but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .","2693":"doctor: okay , i see . patient: yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .","2694":"doctor: okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ? patient: correct .","2695":"doctor: all right . well , let's do a quick exam . patient: all right . sounds good .","2696":"doctor: all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ? patient: no , i feel fine .","2697":"doctor: okay , great . all right . well , that is it for the exam . patient: okay .","2698":"doctor: all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working . patient: okay .","2699":"doctor: and i can order that for today . um , do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long . patient: yes , that's fine . i have time .","2700":"doctor: okay , great . so we will complete that today , um , to assess your overall cardiac structure and function , as well as , uh , the valve view of where diseased . patient: okay .","2701":"doctor: and some hospital outcomes and what we might suggest to fix that out , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called , um , aortic stenosis , and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open , um , quite fully . and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body , and that's called the aorta , into the rest of your body . patient: okay .","2702":"doctor: and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement , or we just call it tavr . and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve . patient: well , i would have to think about that . i'm not too sure i'd wan na do that , given my age of all .","2703":"doctor: yeah , sure , no problem . and we do n't have to make any decisions today , just , you know , wanted to go over a couple of these things . um , but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement , or it's called an savr . but really , because of your age and medical history , um , unfortunately , that would n't be a good option for you . patient: i see . okay . well , i guess we'll see , um , what you see from , from the , um , test .","2704":"doctor: yeah , agreed . okay . and , um , so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we're not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril . so just continue taking those as you are currently . patient: okay , good .","2705":"doctor: and then , it also looks like you're taking about 20 milligrams of simvastatin for your lipids . and i will pr- , um , defer to your pcp . however , given you are having leg pain in both your legs , and given your age and no history of coronary artery d- , artery disease , it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin . patient: really ?","2706":"doctor: yeah , um , possibly . he would have to evaluate you , but it is certainly something to discuss with him . so i will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations and then you guys can talk about the statin . patient: okay , that sounds great . thank you .","2707":"doctor: you're welcome . and then , um , lastly , your hyperthyroidism , uh , i see you're taking levothyroxine . and again , no change here and you can just keep taking that as you have them . patient: okay , i will .","2708":"doctor: all right . so we will see you back here in about three or four weeks to discuss the results and your next steps . um , and we'll , uh , take care of your echocardiogram today . um , any questions ? patient: not that i can think of . thank you so much . and i think it looks good .","2709":"doctor: okay , awesome . all right . well , have a good rest of your day , and we'll see you soon . for physical exam , constitutional elderly otherwise no acute distress . cardiovascular normal s1 and s2 is preserved with a normal rate and regular rhythm . there is a 4\/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with , uhm , mild radiation to the carotids . neurologic gait is normal for age . for assessment and plan , probably one cardiac murmur . diana has a 4\/6 systolic murmur at the upper right sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids . this is most likely representative of aortic stenosis , for symptoms could be due to severe aortic , aortic stenosis . however , her s2 is relatively preserved , which would be more consistent with , consistent with moderate . some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction , so it is possible she , she did have an echocardiogram at some point in the past . she does not appear significantly volume overloaded today . her next problem is pvcs . her referral mentioned tachycardia . uh , her ekg today shows sinus rhythm with frequent pvcs , as well as an anterior septum infarct pattern . she does not have any significant palpitations and we will check an echocardiogram to assess overa- overall cardiac structure and function . depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis , we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation , or further , possibly a heart mon- monitor to assess overall burden of the pvcs . at this point , she's asymptomatic , so we will start with the echocardiogram only . her next problem , hypolipidemia , is managed by her pcp . due to bilateral leg pain over the last month , considered tavr evaluation following echocardiogram . statin could be indicated . and next problem , lightheadedness , dizziness . she is on meclizine for this . it is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness is related to the aorta stenosis , and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above . pvcs on her ekg could be contributing , but she does not feel palpitations . we will consider a monitor , but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above . follow up three to four weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps . end of dictation .","2710":"doctor: hey charles i'm using this cool new recording device to help me with my documentation is that okay with you patient: sure","2711":"doctor: awesome how are you doing today patient: well i could be better you know i moved out in the city about two years ago bought

pulse ox is normal so that's good you do n't appear in any distress you may be might be a little bit nervous to come in and see me but looks pretty good i do not appreciate any rash on your body there is no angioedema which is just swelling of your lips like you mentioned no audible stridor which is a bad noise in your airway when it gets swollen so that's good news if you just want to take a deep breath listening to your lungs on your lungs exam i do appreciate some faint expiratory wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields so i know you had a chest x-ray when you came in i'm looking at that chest x-ray right now and your pulmonary function test and they were both normal so let's talk a little bit about what i think is going on for your first problem you have newly diagnosed allergic asthma so i want you to continue the albuterol inhaler i do n't want you to wait until your symptoms flare up or are bad take it as soon as you start to feel any symptoms at all i'm gon na prescribe something else called singulair ten milligrams you might have seen some commercials for it patient: hmmm","2730":"doctor: you take that once daily and that's gon na help decrease the occurrences of your asthma patient: hmmm","2731":"doctor: i also am gon na proceed with allergy testing have you ever had an allergy test before patient: no","2732":"doctor: okay we'll start with skin testing and we'll see if we can target what the triggers in hopes in hopes that we can avoid any any other management and this can be successful if we ca n't figure out what it is from that we'll have to discuss more testing in your blood and do immunotherapy so i wan na see you next week to schedule the skin testing do you have any questions for me patient: should i come my cats","2733":"doctor: so bryan it's nice to see you again in the office today what's going on patient: i was in my yard yesterday and i was raking leaves and i felt fine and then when i got into my house about two hours later my back started tightening up and i started getting pins and needles in my right foot","2734":"doctor: alright have you ever had this type of back pain before patient: i had it once about three years ago but it went away after a day","2735":"doctor: okay and did you try anything for the pain yet did you take anything or have you have you tried icing patient: put some ice on it and i tried two advils and it did n't help","2736":"doctor: okay does it get better when you're laying down sitting standing patient: yeah i think the only thing that helped was a hot shower and it feels a little better when i sit","2737":"doctor: okay alright so you said you were raking leaves and now it's been kind of that weather outside for cleaning out the yard have you been doing a lot of yard work lately patient: i i i normally do n't do any physical activity","2738":"doctor: yeah i hear you i make a i make my husband do all the yard work too so alright let me take a look at that low back if if you bend over does that hurt patient: it hurts a little bit when i bend over yes","2739":"doctor: okay how about when you stand back up patient: no pain","2740":"doctor: okay so no pain on extension some pain on flexion how about when i push right here on your back patient: yeah that hurts","2741":"doctor: okay so some pain to palpation right around the l5 can i have that patient: what happens when family members chime in like i'm doing right now because i actually think it was it hurts more when he stands up because i've watched him bend over but it's when he stands up that it really hurts","2742":"doctor: okay and and what's your relationship patient: partners","2743":"doctor: okay so your partner is here with you today and reports that he is also having pain when you are standing up patient: i've spent so many times you know who i am","2744":"doctor: so that's right you always come in together have you noticed anything else partner when when he is patient: i'm worried about it because he is you know his pain tolerance is so high and he would n't be saying anything if it really was n't a problem because it's not at all like last week when he thought about raking leaves but did n't actually rake leaves but then his back did n't hurt as much but this time it really hurts","2745":"doctor: okay so you think this is more of a long term injury patient: no he was just thinking about it hurting when he thought about raking but it did n't","2746":"doctor: okay alright and have you noticed any any prior pain with with the back patient: i do n't want to take this away you better go back to talking to him","2747":"doctor: that's alright let's see how it turns out okay so how about if you if i push down on both your feet like this can you push back up on my hands patient: can you repeat that","2748":"doctor: if i'm pushing down on your feet can you push push your feet back patient: i","2749":"doctor: alright so your dorsiflexion is normal looks like pulses are equal in all extremities you said you had a little bit of a tingling sensation in which leg patient: that would be my right leg","2750":"doctor: okay so some tingling in your right leg alright so i know that you had an x-ray when you came in because we always do x-rays when we have our patients come in of your low back and everything looks normal from that perspective so for your back pain sounds like you probably sprained your low back so i what i want you to do is let's rest it i'm going to prescribe some meloxicam have you taken that before patient: i have not taken meloxicam","2751":"doctor: alright so i'll prescribe that i'm also gon na prescribe some physical therapy i know you said you have n't been overly active and your partner reported the same thing for a long time so we might wan na get you into some pt and hopefully get you back back in shape get you some stretches that you can do and some exercises and then you know if it's not improving i want you to send me a message and we can possibly look into see if there is anything else going on potentially an mri if it's still not improving does that sound like an okay plan patient: it sounds reasonable","2752":"doctor: alright patient: i think he should have an mri now i think he had surgery yesterday i think he should have an mri now this it's been hurting for like six hours now and she had an mri we are really worried about it","2753":"doctor: alright you know let's give it a couple of weeks and let's give it two weeks and then call me back and we'll get you an mri if it's still not improving patient: good answer","2754":"doctor: alright alright hope you feel better","2755":"doctor: hey gregory good to see you today so take a look at my notes and i see that you're here you've had a nonhealing foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it patient: sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed","2756":"doctor: okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden patient: i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach","2757":"doctor: okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics patient: they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet","2758":"doctor: okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you patient: i do n't recall the name exactly","2759":"doctor: do n't recall alright patient: something i had taken it before","2760":"doctor: okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it patient: i'm sorry","2761":"doctor: so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot patient: at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance","2762":"doctor: dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt patient: it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red","2763":"doctor: okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled patient: i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time","2764":"doctor: okay do you patient: i'm not really sure how","2765":"doctor: okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it patient: i think they told me it was around ten","2766":"doctor: around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt patient: no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct","2767":"doctor: okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening patient: they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me","2768":"doctor: okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound patient: that sounds great","2769":"doctor: alright do you have any other question patient: i do if anything happens in between","2770":"doctor: please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks patient: okay sounds great thanks document","2771":"doctor: alright great","2772":"doctor: so stephanie morales is a 36 -year-old female today complaining of her ankle pain and she also has a history of diabetes and high blood pressure so stephanie tell me what's going on with your ankle patient: well we had a long spring and the other day we got some snow and ice i was walking to my car and i slipped and my left ankle kinda turned underneath me","2773":"doctor: okay and so this happened couple days ago or how many days ago patient: two days ago","2774":"doctor: two days ago okay and so it's your left ankle and it kinda just twisted underneath you on the kind of on the inside patient: yeah more on the it's more on the outside of my hips","2775":"doctor: and did you fall down or did you just kind of cut catch yourself patient: no i fell","2776":"doctor: okay and were you able to get up afterwards or somebody helped you up patient: i was but it was very sore and then started swelling and quite a bit of pain so it's hard to walk","2777":"doctor: sure have you tried anything for pain or the swelling or anything like that patient: ibuprofen some ice and elevation","2778":"doctor: okay has that helped much or not really patient: a little bit","2779":"doctor: okay and any pain above your ankle does it hurt on your on your calf or your lower leg at all or knee at all patient: no it's mostly just the outside of my ankle","2780":"doctor: okay got it and no bleeding or i'm sure it's a little swollen probably patient: yeah it's swollen but no bleeding","2781":"doctor: well i'll have you take off your shoes in a second we'll examine you in a second but since you're here and i wanted to talk about some of your other things that you know we have n't i have n't seen you in a year so let's talk about your history of diabetes as well are you taking the metformin how's your blood sugars been how how're you managing that any issues with that patient: no they've been pretty stable","2782":"doctor: you're checking your sugars regularly as well patient: yes","2783":"doctor: okay your hemoglobin a1c last time i looked at epic was about six . eight which is really good so i think you're doing a great job we had talked about you know cutting off the sweets and sugars and stuff like that and exercising so it sounds like you're you're you're doing a pretty good job with that have you seen the ophthalmologist recently for your eye exam for your diabetes checkup or no patient: i am due for one of those in the next couple of weeks","2784":"doctor: okay alright so we'll so you do you already have an appointment or do you need to make an appointment for that patient: i have an appointment","2785":"doctor: perfect excellent okay and how is your blood pressure been i know we watching it your blood pressure today looks pretty good it's about one seventy over i'm sorry one twenty over seventy you're taking norvasc any issues with that any do you need any refills or anything patient: i need a refill on that yes","2786":"doctor: okay alright well let me examine you here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my match exam and i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put that into my record okay so your neck exam is fine there is no bruits your lungs are clear your heart exam is normal you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is i think you probably have an ankle sprain but i would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone and i'm sometimes worried about a fracture so i'm gon na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you patient: that's a great plan i need to get back to exercising so","2787":"doctor: perfect and for the diabetes keep the eye appointment that you already have you know continue with the metformin i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check some baseline labs as well since it's been a while since we checked them and then once if you have any issues or you know give me a call we can get you into the office and for the high blood pressure i'll go ahead and refill the norvasc today you're doing a great job with that it sounds like continue to monitor that if something changes certainly call me we can get you in sooner okay patient: thank you","2788":"doctor: sounds good sounds good good great seeing you thanks stephanie patient: thank you","2789":"doctor: okay hi wayne well i understand you're here for you've got a sore on your foot that's not healing is that right patient: yes","2790":"doctor: so can you tell me about that how are you doing patient: well i've been doing okay but i've had this wound on my right foot for a couple of weeks and it's not getting better i saw my pcp and they referred me to you i i used to see a podiatrist and a couple of years ago but they moved and i was n't able to get another one","2791":"doctor: okay and how long have you had the wound patient: about two to three weeks","2792":"doctor: okay have you had any kind of trauma to that foot patient: no i bought a new pair of shoes to travel with and the neuropathy i guess i did n't feel that they were too tight at first it was just a blister but it looked a lot worse now i've been putting a band-aid on it and","2793":"doctor: okay and so did your doctor put you on any antibiotics when they they saw your foot patient: yes i finished the course yesterday the wound looked about the same though","2794":"doctor: okay now does it hurt patient: no i ca n't feel it","2795":"doctor: okay now have you had any other symptoms like fever chills drainage from the wound or anything along those lines patient: no but when i take my sock off sometimes it sticks to the wound even when i put a band-aid on","2796":"doctor: okay well are you still wearing those same shoes that cause the problem patient: no i'm upset","2797":"doctor: i'm so upset too i love those shoes patient: no i'm so upset i i love those shoes","2798":"doctor: okay so what kind of shoes are they patient: they're hoka's","2799":"doctor: ah so where did you get them patient: i got them at rei couple of years ago","2800":"doctor: they're pretty good about helping you to fit your fit you in a shoe are n't they patient: yeah","2801":"doctor: so what do you like about them patient: they are comfortable they are easy to take on and off and they provide good stability","2802":"doctor: that's good so you've had some issues with stability sometimes or patient: yes","2803":"doctor: okay okay well another question i want to ask you is how is your diabetes doing patient: i do n't think it's too bad my last hgb a1c was a little over eight","2804":"doctor: okay alright well let me just do a quick physical exam okay for vital signs your temperature is ninety eight . one your vital signs look good your heart rate is seventy two respirations sixteen blood pressure is one ten over sixty five okay so on your foot exam let's see there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot it is just proximal to the right fifth to the fifth mtp joint and there is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue there's no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there's no evidence of fluid collection there's no necrosis there is no odor i do not appreciate any bony exposure on on vascular exam there are palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses there are no palpable dp or pt pulses but doppler signs are present okay so does this hurt when i touch it here patient: no it's okay","2805":"doctor: okay alright so i've reviewed the results your right foot x-ray that we did before you i came in the room and this shows no evidence of osteomyelitis which means there is no evidence of bone infection so that's really good so let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem your diabetic foot ulcer so i want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to your foot to see if you can heal this wound i'm also gon na perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue and then next i'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and i want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area okay so i do n't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see you again in two weeks so we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay patient: okay","2806":"doctor: okay so for your diabetes it's gon na be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal so we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without a being too much but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin a1c into a little bit better level okay patient: okay","2807":"doctor: alright do you have any other questions patient: no","2808":"doctor: hey william so i see that you injured your knee could you tell me a bit about what happened patient: yeah i thought it was a good idea to go to the trampoline park with my wife and heard a snap and instant pain when i was on the trampoline","2809":"doctor: okay alright and so do do you go to the trampoline park often patient: i do n't and i think that's the issue","2810":"doctor: okay so this is the first time you'd ever done something like that patient: yes","2811":"doctor: okay alright i just wan na get like a few more details do you like work out regularly was this for fun or for like an exercise class patient: no it's just for fun","2812":"doctor: okay and do you have like a regular exercise regimen at all patient: try to not consistent with it","2813":"doctor: okay no that's fine this is not a place of judgment i just i'm just trying to understand like if a little bit more of the background okay so we went to the trampoline park which knee where did you hurt patient: my right","2814":"doctor: okay your right knee and so based on like your inside and outside which part hurts more patient: it's kind of the outside of the knee","2815":"doctor: alright so the lateral aspect not a problem and you said that you heard a pop when you landed right patient: yeah","2816":"doctor: okay have you taken anything for the pain patient: just tylenol","2817":"doctor: alright so did the tylenol help patient: not really","2818":"doctor: okay alright and so hmmm when does it have you tried anything else like did you ice it use heat anything like that patient: no i just kinda elevated it and that was about it","2819":"doctor: okay that's fine and how long ago did this happen patient: a week ago","2820":"doctor: okay alright so you put up with the pain for a week that's i'm proud of you for that patient: i do n't like to come to the doctors","2821":"doctor: excuse me i feel rejected right now why why would you say something like that it's fine but you know i i like it when you're not here either because that means that you're doing a good job so let's see about like getting your knee fixed up but i want to talk about some of the other issues that you have first so we know that you have hypertension right and i discussed maybe you getting a blood pressure cuff because i needed you to measure those a bit more regularly did you get the cuff patient: what no","2822":"doctor: no okay that's fine have you measured your blood pressure recently at all patient: no","2823":"doctor: okay are you still taking your medication because i see you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril patient: yeah most days i remember","2824":"doctor: okay ra i'm not suspicious but we're just gon na go with that okay because looking at your vitals it it is of still a bit high i'm not really comfortable i see like a hundred and eighty over you know eighty and that's not where we wan na be so i wonder if we might need to adjust your medication but let's talk about your diabetes how are your blood sugars patient: i think they're little bit better","2825":"doctor: okay what makes you think that have you been taking them patient: yeah i check it you know most days again kinda when i remember","2826":"doctor: okay how often are you checking it patient: i would say four five times a week","2827":"doctor: okay you might wan na switch to maybe two or three times a day but you know that's something i'm glad that you are measuring are you taking your metformin patient: yes","2828":"doctor: okay and then i think we have you on five hundred milligrams correct patient: yes","2829":"doctor: alright how is your diet patient: kinda the same as my exercise decent could be better","2830":"doctor: alright and okay not a problem so what is your do you are you measuring your calories at all looking at your macros are you just eating what you feel like patient: yeah just trying to watch what i eat more than anything but nothing specific","2831":"doctor: okay and are you do you know if you're particularly focused on your salt like is it like a low salt diet patient: no just trying to watch my carbs a little bit more but not counting or anything","2832":"doctor: alright so like is it a specific diet i just wan na make sure like are you on like the keto diet patient: no","2833":"doctor: okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam as i mentioned before your blood pressure is a little high as i listen to your heart i do like it's got a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur when i listen to your lungs they sound clear bilaterally i would like to look at your knee though so when i press here on the outside does it hurt patient: little bit","2834":"doctor: okay and then when i press on the inside does it hurt patient: no","2835":"doctor: alright can you bend your knee and straighten it patient: i can i think that's all i can i can bend","2836":"doctor: mm-hmm alright so are you having problems walking can you bear weight patient: i can but i have a little bit of a limp","2837":"doctor: okay so do you mind getting up and walking for me really quickly alright so i do notice that there is a slight gait like there is a small sorry you are correcting you do have a limp i i am a little worried about that but it's probably it's probably the superficial when i'm looking at your knee i do notice some like ecchymosis and edema that just means bruising and swelling along the lateral aspect of your knee i do n't notice any effusion and it looks like you have a decent range of motion but i do understand that you know you are experiencing pain with some movement okay i'm gon na go ahead and order an x-ray and when you come back we can have that discussion alright so i reviewed the results of your right knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so let's talk about my assessment and plan alright so for your first problem of right knee pain i think you have a lateral a lateral ligament strain i wan na prescribe some meloxicam which is gon na be fifteen milligrams daily for pain and swelling i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the area and to prevent further injury if you're still having pain we can do further imaging imaging but like this is a common injury that tends to heal on its own for your second problem with hypertension i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams and order an echo i am concerned that we might not be getting your blood pressure to where we need it to be so we might have to do some medication modification for your third problem with diabetes i wan na order an a1c i know that you said you have been measuring your blood sugars but i think this would give us a better image of what's been happening long term and i also wan na order a lipid panel in case we need to make any adjustments to that medication as well do you have any questions patient: sounds good","2838":"doctor: alright awesome","2839":"doctor: hey matthew i see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your pcp sent you over to see me how're you doing today patient: pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse","2840":"doctor: okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there patient: well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time","2841":"doctor: so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version patient: well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden","2842":"doctor: okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at patient: yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month","2843":"doctor: okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes patient: yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here","2844":"doctor: okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me patient: it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg","2845":"doctor: okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life patient: right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten","2846":"doctor: okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better patient: yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down","2847":"doctor: okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs patient: you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well","2848":"doctor: that's okay patient: to explain but this is what i deal with every single day","2849":"doctor: absolutely patient: lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them","2850":"doctor: so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here patient: no it's right here","2851":"doctor: okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there patient: it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks","2852":"doctor: okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please patient: okay that's it that's all i got","2853":"doctor: alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan patient: sure sounds good","2854":"doctor: alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you","2855":"doctor: hi jacqueline how are you doing today patient: i'm doing okay i'm just really anxious about my recent blood work that my pcp did and said that i have hepatitis c i'm just really surprised because i've been feeling fine","2856":"doctor: okay so were you ever told in the past that you have hepatitis c patient: no never","2857":"doctor: okay and do do you have any history like iv drug use known that you know or do you have any known to have any like hepatitis c positive partners patient: i mean like years ago i used to party a lot and even use iv drugs but i've been clean for over fifteen years now","2858":"doctor: okay well very good you know congratulations on that that's that's a great great achievement so tell me though how about alcohol use patient: i used to drink a lot a lot more alcohol now i probably would say i drink about a beer a day","2859":"doctor: okay alright how about smoking have you ever smoked patient: i do smoke i'm down to one to two cigarettes a day it's just really been tough to just get rid of those two but i've cut down a lot i used to i was up to one point or a pack and a half a day","2860":"doctor: wow okay alright so yeah you you definitely have decreased that so that's again good for you on that one so hopefully you keep you keep that up patient: thing","2861":"doctor: so tell me do you have any other medication conditions patient: do i do i no otherwise i'm i'm feel pretty good i had my physical there was nothing else the the only thing i was telling my pcp is i do feel like tend to be really tired at the end of the day after working but otherwise i've been good","2862":"doctor: okay and and has work been not hard lately you've been busy it sounds like patient: i know i have been busy but not really much more than usual","2863":"doctor: okay alright well i hope you're not working too much and then you'll able to at least find some time with the family patient: yeah i'm i yeah i tend to be a workaholic but yes i i am working on that","2864":"doctor: okay well i hope kids are doing okay patient: they are thank you","2865":"doctor: okay good so tell me what conditions what kind of conditions run in your family like is there do you have hypertension diabetes or patient: yeah all of all of the above","2866":"doctor: okay and depression okay alright well let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here i reviewed your vitals and everything there looks good so that's good and now on general appearance you appear in no distress and no jaundice on skin exam let me go ahead and listen to your heart here great on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with a two out of six six systolic murmur appreciate appreciated that's that has n't changed from last year so we will just continue to monitor that monitor that as well okay patient: okay","2867":"doctor: alright now let me listen to your lungs here very good so your your lungs are clear with no wheezes rales or rhonchi and let me go ahead and listen to your abdomen great your bowel sounds are present your abdomen is soft with no hepatospleno splenomegaly ca n't talk to appreciated so let me now check your musculoskeletal exam here great i i did n't see any gait disturbance and no edema so that's great so jacqueline i did review the results of your recent blood blood work and your hcv antibody test was positive and your liver panel that was done showing an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so what that all means and let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan here for your first problem of hepatitis c your initial labs are consistent with hepatitis c so based on the the once i just discussed with you there now hepatitis c is a viral infection that affects the liver so you most likely may have had it for years now so the next step that i would like to do is to confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work that includes checking the hep c rna and also the hcv genotype okay now i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and i'm gon na do this by ordering a special ultrasound and with this information i'm gon na be able to know how to proceed as far as treatment patient: okay","2868":"doctor: alright now i know that was a lot of information do you have any questions for me patient: yeah so should i be worried about my wife and my kids should they be tested as well","2869":"doctor: yes so we can start with the same screening that you have had for you for all of them first okay patient: okay alright so i'll make sure i'll have them set up an appointment with our our family doctor","2870":"doctor: okay great so if you do n't have any other questions i'm gon na have the nurse check you out and get all that scheduled and i'm gon na see you in about three weeks patient: alright perfect","2871":"doctor: alright patient: thank you","2872":"doctor: take care jacqueline patient: okay bye","2873":"doctor: alright good morning Julie how are you doing today patient: i'm doing okay i'm just a little nervous about what's been going on with my headaches","2874":"doctor: okay so i know you were sent here by your your pcp what was your understanding of why you were sent here patient: yeah so i actually have been someone who been struggling with headaches for years now ever since i was a teenager and they used to be around my when i would have my menstrual my menses but as i got older i noticed that it has been with that and also i can get it when i'm really stressed but recently and why i went to her is because my headaches have been getting a lot more they've just been happening a lot more frequently and a lot more severe","2875":"doctor: okay can you tell me a little bit about them what how do they how do they feel when they come on patient: so they say mostly on my right side and it even seems like it's like behind my eye and it just like this pulsing like this really bad pulsing sensation","2876":"doctor: okay do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse i know you said they they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse patient: i i have noticed that you know i've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight but i ca n't even really exercise for very long because i start of as soon as i start to jog i my headaches the headaches come back on a lot worse so i notice it when i'm exercising","2877":"doctor: okay and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches patient: i've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now and then what really scared me is that now i'm starting to get some blurred vision it's not all the time but it it will come and go but some blurred like on the in my on the side of my vision","2878":"doctor: okay okay and have you experienced any numbness or tingling to your hands or feet or your face patient: no i have n't","2879":"doctor: okay so you you like to run a lot what kind of do you do you use a a good shoe you know what kind of shoes do you use for your running patient: yeah i yeah i i'm starting to get back into it i'm a big new balance person in asics so yeah those are the two brands i like to wear yeah so right now i'm using asics","2880":"doctor: okay yeah i like to run too and i use nike patient: okay","2881":"doctor: i used to get tumor guy but i i really kinda moved over to nike patient: hmmm","2882":"doctor: that's good you know it is running is a great exercise patient: it is","2883":"doctor: so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri patient: yeah she was gon na put one in but she wanted me to see you first and urgently so they have n't called me yet for the mri","2884":"doctor: okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about patient: okay","2885":"doctor: now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal patient: okay go ahead sorry","2886":"doctor: that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me patient: yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery","2887":"doctor: not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment patient: okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week","2888":"doctor: yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri patient: okay alright thank you bye","2889":"doctor: bye sorry","2890":"doctor: alright so hey it's nice to see you jack i know you've been

no other mag of my neck i really ca n't see that","2905":"doctor: yeah okay no just checking okay so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my physical exam so when i press on here on the side of your neck does it hurt patient: yeah a little bit","2906":"doctor: okay positive pain to palpation of the soft tissues of the neck what about when i press on your back or your shoulders patient: no that's fine","2907":"doctor: okay so when you flex your neck when you're touching your chin to your chest does that hurt patient: mm-hmm","2908":"doctor: alright positive pain with flexion what about when you move it back patient: yeah that hurts worse","2909":"doctor: okay okay severe positive pain to extension okay so can you turn your head from side to side does that hurt patient: yeah a little bit","2910":"doctor: okay positive pain with rotation and then can you touch your ear to your shoulders patient: no","2911":"doctor: okay alright so positive pain on lateral bending wow this is pretty this is pretty serious not serious necessarily sorry about that so i reviewed the results of your x-ray but the results show no signs of fracture or bony abnormalities but let's go ahead and talk about my assessment and plan for you i believe what you have is something called neck strain for your neck pain i sorry treatments we are gon na go ahead and treat this a bit conservatively your i'm gon na put you on anti-inflammatories motrin six hundred milligrams and you're gon na take that every six to eight hours i also wan na give you a muscle relaxant called flexeril and it's gon na be ten milligrams and you'll take that every twelve hours as needed i'm gon na want you to try your best to to like relax your neck i'm sorry not to strain your neck anymore like to be conservative with how you move about and everything like that i also wan na order an mri just because you said you did n't go to the hospital or anything like that i just wan na make sure that you you're not suffering from like a concussion but this is something that's commonly referred to as like whiplash right your head just like it it just wiped essentially like back and forth to so severely and and that's probably what's causing your pain i think i wan na refer you to either physical rehab or a chiropractor once we get the results of the mri just to make sure that there is n't any impingement of like the nerves or anything like that do you have any questions patient: i heard the chiropractors will shake they work","2912":"doctor: i do understand that some people have like reservations about going to the chiropractor but you know we do have some good ones that have like longstanding histories and patients that have had positive results from the experience but if you if you do n't like the idea of that we can consider other options like that rehab and physical therapy patient: okay","2913":"doctor: alright any other questions patient: no","2914":"doctor: alright thank you","2915":"doctor: hey hi bobby how are you doing patient: i'm doing good how are you","2916":"doctor: i'm doing fine so i understand you're here having some left or some right shoulder pain that you've had for a few weeks now patient: yeah it was i was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know i was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just has n't been going away","2917":"doctor: okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before patient: a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger","2918":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so","2919":"doctor: okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not patient: yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it","2920":"doctor: okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go patient: just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain","2921":"doctor: okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also patient: a little bit because i sleep on that side so","2922":"doctor: okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that patient: i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it","2923":"doctor: okay and does that seem to help or patient: a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit","2924":"doctor: well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and patient: i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift","2925":"doctor: wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then patient: yeah","2926":"doctor: yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or patient: no not really no numbness that i can think of","2927":"doctor: okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven . eight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan patient: no that sounds good","2928":"doctor: okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay patient: sounds great","2929":"doctor: okay thanks patient: thanks","2930":"doctor: did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or patient: my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but","2931":"doctor: yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that patient: okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good","2932":"doctor: mister jackson is a 45 -year-old male who has a history of diabetes type two and mild intermittent asthma and he is here today with right elbow pain so hey there mark nice to see you again listen sorry you're having some elbow pain let's talk about it but i would like to record this conversation with this cool app that i'm using that's gon na help me focus on you a bit more would that be alright with you patient: yeah

anywhere like down to your arm up to your shoulder or anywhere else patient: no it does n't","2936":"doctor: okay and what would you say the pain is you know on a scale of zero to ten patient: it's probably an eight when i'm just when i'm using it even if it's to get something out of the cupboard and it's a three when i'm just kinda resting","2937":"doctor: hmmm okay and do you would you say it's a sharp pain stabbing pain aching throbbing how would you describe it patient: all of the above shooting stabbing very sharp","2938":"doctor: okay alright and you let's see other than the the tennis you know increase in tennis activity you have n't had any trauma recently falling on it or you know felt a pop anywhere or anything like that have you patient: not that i can recall","2939":"doctor: okay and and you said it's it's worse with movement better with rest is there anything else that makes it makes it worse or makes it better patient: i've taken some tylenol and ibuprofen but as soon as those wear off it it comes right back so they do n't really help","2940":"doctor: okay okay alright yeah well i definitely i'm glad you're getting some exercise now that's good for your diabetes and all that and out there playing tennis kinda back back to the back to the old days for you right did do i recall that were n't you a big tennis player back in the day like state champ in high school or something patient: yeah yeah that was a hundred years ago i ca n't i i try to play like that and i ca n't i ca n't do that anymore but yeah a good memory that's a that's a good memory","2941":"doctor: i did i did yeah that was that was crazy that was a great tournament what a what a finish unbelievable patient: yeah hey did you see the masters i know you're a golfer","2942":"doctor: yeah yeah yeah i do n't get out as often as i as as i like to but but the masters yeah that was that was amazing that was lot of fun to lot of fun did you catch it too patient: i did","2943":"doctor: yep yep agreed agreed and so well listen we'll we'll hopefully get you feeling better here and get you back out on the court and out on the course and we'll talk about that but let's let me ask you about your diabetes a little bit a little bit here so how have your blood sugars been running mark have they been what in the low one hundreds two hundreds where are they patient: they are like one fifty one sixty you know we just had easter and my kids got a whole bunch of candies so i keep eating that","2944":"doctor: hmmm okay yeah yeah understood so those cadboy eggs they'll get you every time too right patient: yes","2945":"doctor: boy my gosh yeah those are the best so those are those are deadly do n't tell my cardiologist so okay so listen you know i see that we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams once a day no actually last visit we increased it so i've got you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day correct you're still taking that patient: yes twice a day","2946":"doctor: okay and but your blood sugars are a bit off you know maybe those the cadberry eggs so how about your asthma how has that been doing you know have you had any asthma attacks you're still taking flovent twice a day and the albuterol as needed patient: yeah knock on wood i my asthma is pretty much under control","2947":"doctor: okay excellent excellent alright and i recall you know just kinda review a few things i i think you've got an allergy to penicillin is that correct patient: that's correct yes","2948":"doctor: okay and then you you know your surgical history you had your your gallbladder out what about ten years ago i think by doctor nelson correct patient: yes that's right","2949":"doctor: okay and then let's go ahead and examine you alright so mark your exam is pretty much you know for the most part normal with a few exceptions on your heart exam you still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur and that's unchanged from prior exam we're watching that and so that just means i hear some some heart sounds as your heart is beating there i'm not too concerned about it as as that's not changed otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and your physical exam otherwise on your musculoskeletal exam on your right elbow you do have moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness of the right elbow and how about when i move this when i move your elbow like this does that hurt you patient: kills","2950":"doctor: okay sorry about that so you've got moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow there is no palpable joint effusion and now what if i press against your wrist like so does that hurt you patient: yeah it hurts a little bit","2951":"doctor: okay alright sorry so that's you have mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist as well okay otherwise normal unremarkable exam and let's talk about your results now so your right elbow x-ray today shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality so that's good there's no malalignment or sign of joint effusion and otherwise it's a normal right elbow x-ray so that's reassuring okay and hey you know i meant to ask you you know and do you have any history of fever recently you know along with the elbow pain you had noticed a fever patient: no i do n't think so","2952":"doctor: okay great excellent alright so tell you what let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan here so for your first problem my assessment is is that you have acute lateral epicondylitis of your right elbow and this is also known as tennis elbow go figure right so this is due to overuse likely the increase in your your tennis activity which normally would be good but maybe we're overdoing it a little bit so i have a few recommendations i'd like you to rest your right arm as much as you can i want you to stop tennis for the next four to six weeks and please avoid repetitive stress in that right arm as well i want you to ice that right elbow for twenty minutes at least three times per day and this should reduce the pain and inflammation and then i'm also going to give you a brace for your right forearm and my nurse will give this to you before you leave that should help with the discomfort okay in that right elbow i will also write you a prescription for ultram and this should help with the pain i'll write you a prescription ultram fifty milligrams once per day that should help with your elbow pain so then i wan na see you in follow-up in four weeks and so we'll reevaluate your elbow at that time and if you we'll consider some additional imaging if needed possibly a physical therapy referral depending on how you're doing mkay now for your second problem of diabetes type two my assessment is is that your blood sugar is a little bit out of control mkay so we need to make some adjustments i'm going to increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice per day and i want you to check your blood sugar twice daily for the next two weeks and then let me know how your blood sugar is running and we can make some additional adjustments if needed but i will increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice a day now i'm going to also order a hemoglobin a1c level and and a cbc blood test today and and so we'll check those results the hemoglobin a1c and the cbc and then i'm going to also check a chem-12 blood test as well and now for your third problem of the mild acute intermittent asthma you my assessment is that it really remains under good control so let's keep you on that flovent and the albuterol no changes there and you can use those as tolerated it does look like you need a refill on your albuterol so i'm gon na write you a prescription for a refill of the albuterol and you can pick that up at your pharmacy as well so how does that all sound any questions for me patient: it sounds pretty good i ca n't believe it's just tennis elbow feel like a looser coming in here but it's okay i get it","2953":"doctor: yeah yeah well patient: i'm not i'm not young anymore","2954":"doctor: yeah well let's let's keep you active but take a break for a bit and let's ease back into it okay so it's great to see you and i'll see you back in four weeks let me know if you have other problems in the meantime patient: okay","2955":"doctor: alright so how're you doing today angela patient: i'm doing pretty well","2956":"doctor: alright so looking here at your appointment notes it says you're you're here you think you have a kidney stone you had some in the past so we're gon na take a look at that and then you also have a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes we want to take a look at those as well so first thing what's going on with your kidneys you as what how long ago have you been feeling pain and and how's all that patient: pain's been up and down i went to the emergency room last week but now i think i'm doing a little bit better","2957":"doctor: okay so the case of kidney stones so have you had you said you've had them in the past and how often would you say patient: i do n't know i this is probably like my seventh or eighth kidney stone","2958":"doctor: seven or eight kidney stones so do you think you passed it yet or is it still in the patient: i think this one passed yeah","2959":"doctor: this one passed how long would you say it took to patient: well i went last week and then i think it passed about three days ago","2960":"doctor: okay so are you still noticing any blood in your urine patient: no no more blood","2961":"doctor: alright are you still having pain patient: nope","2962":"doctor: okay that that's that's that's really good did they do anything for you at the hospital giving you any medications patient: they gave me some pain medicine","2963":"doctor: okay do you remember what it was patient: i think it was percocet","2964":"doctor: okay well that's good i'm very glad to see that you were able to pass that stone have you seen a urologist before about this patient: i have n't seen one in a while but yes i saw someone maybe a year ago","2965":"doctor: okay so yeah i know you keep having these recurrent kidney stones so i definitely think we can get you a referral to urology just to check up on that and also wan na do some labs as well patient: okay","2966":"doctor: so i also see you're here for you have a past medical history of of hypertension and when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was a one fifty over ninety i'm reading here in your chart you're on two point five of norvasc patient: hmmm","2967":"doctor: now have you been taking that regularly patient: i have but at home my blood pressure is always great","2968":"doctor: okay maybe you have a little white coat syndrome some of my patients do have it i have it myself and i'm a provider so i definitely understand yeah i know we we talked about last time you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking those about two to three times a week so what have those readings been i'm usually like one thirty to one forty over sixty to seventy patient: okay","2969":"doctor: that's that's that's not too bad i think when you first came in you were around like one eighty so it seems to be that that norvasc is is working for you how about your diet i know you were having a little issue eating some fast food and and cakes and cookies and have you been able to get that under control patient: yeah it's hard to give up the fast food altogether because it's a lot of on the go you know","2970":"doctor: okay so do you think you would be able to get that under control by yourself or would you do you think you would need help with that maybe a dietitian be able to help you out patient: yeah i do n't know i do n't know if i can make another appointment i just add to the extra","2971":"doctor: yeah yeah definitely understand patient: mm-hmm","2972":"doctor: alright yeah so i mean that's one thing we just got ta work one is your diet we try to keep you at least just twenty three hundred milligrams or less of sodium per day i know that's hard for a lot of salads and stuff i know it's hard for lot of people especially with all like the the prepackage foods we have around today so that's definitely something we we should work on patient: mm-hmm","2973":"doctor: so let's also look here you have a history of diabetes and so you're on that five hundred milligrams of metformin daily now have you been taking that as well patient: yeah i take my metformin","2974":"doctor: so what have your blood sugars been running daily patient: well i do n't check it very often","2975":"doctor: okay so i'm looking here i think last after your last visit you got a1c now was six . seven so it's a little bit high it's gone down a little bit since you were first diagnosed with the type two diabetes a year ago so i'm glad we're making progress with that as well alright so i'm just gon na do a quick physical exam on you before i do just wan na make sure are you having any chest pain today patient: no","2976":"doctor: alright any any belly pain patient: no","2977":"doctor: alright so i'm gon na listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles listen to your heart so on your heart exam i do hear that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and we already knew about that previously so it has n't gotten any worse so that's good so i'm gon na just press here in your abdomen because that you did have those kidney stones does that hurt patient: no","2978":"doctor: alright i'm gon na press here on your back patient: no pain","2979":"doctor: okay so on your abdomen exam of your abdomen i'm showing no tenderness to palpation of the abdomen or tenderness of the the cva either on the right side so that that's good i think that's pretty much cleared up so let's we'll talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you and so my assessment you you did have the those kidney stones but i i think they are passed this time but i do want to get a couple of labs so we'll get a urinalysis patient: okay","2980":"doctor: alright we'll get a urine culture just to make sure everything is is cleared up i also want to give you a referral to referral referral to urology patient: okay","2981":"doctor: because you do keep having these all the time and so maybe there's something else going wrong and so they can help get that under control patient: can i see doctor harris","2982":"doctor: of course yeah we can we can get you that road to doctor harris and patient: he's not like","2983":"doctor: he's great he's he's he he he's great i've heard he does really good work so that'll be good so for the hypertension you seem to be doing well on the two . five of norvasc so we are not gon na make any changes to that do you need any refills right now patient: no usually the pharmacy just sends them through when i call","2984":"doctor: okay great so we we wo n't we gave you refills with that i do wan na give you a consult to nutrition patient: okay","2985":"doctor: just to help you with that diet patient: okay","2986":"doctor: because i think that's a major factor of us eventually getting you off of all medications patient: hmmm","2987":"doctor: and then for your diabetes i'm just keep you on that on that five hundred of metformin okay i think you're doing well with that as well also but i do want you to start taking your blood sugars if you can take them before every meal patient: okay","2988":"doctor: just to gauge where you are so you can tell how much food you should actually be be eating patient: okay","2989":"doctor: alright patient: i can try that","2990":"doctor: so how does that that sound patient: that sounds like a plan when should i come back and see you","2991":"doctor: so you can you can come back in three months and we'll check up again i forgot you did tell me last time that you were having some issues with insomnia patient: hmmm","2992":"doctor: how is that going for you is it still happening patient: i mean sometimes i stay awake just kinda worrying about things but but i've tried some meditation apps and that helps","2993":"doctor: okay alright and i know we talked a little bit before about practicing proper sleep hygiene you know just making sure that all of your electronics are off you know dark room patient: yeah","2994":"doctor: cool room have you been doing that patient: well i do like to sleep with the tv on and my phone is right by my bed because i never know if someone's gon na call me you know","2995":"doctor: yeah i i know i'm like apple i do n't know if you have an iphone or not but i know apple has this the the sleep mode now do that disturbance so you put that on patient: it's a good idea","2996":"doctor: interrupt you patient: yeah","2997":"doctor: okay have you tried taking melatonin to sleep patient: i used it a couple times but but it did n't seem to help that much","2998":"doctor: okay how about i do n't think i've prescribed you anything yet do you think you would need anything patient: hmmm i do n't really wan na take any sleeping pills","2999":"doctor: okay that's understandable alright so for the last issue for the insomnia i'm just gon na have you take ten milligrams of melatonin as needed patient: okay","3000":"doctor: and just try i guess the best as possible to practice the proper sleep hygiene so you can get to sleep at night and and feel pretty rested patient: okay","3001":"doctor: alright patient: mm-hmm","3002":"doctor: so do you have anything any other questions for me patient: no that's all","3003":"doctor: alright so we will see you in three months patient: okay sounds good","3004":"doctor: alright patient: like","3005":"doctor: hey betty how are you doing patient: i'm doing okay i just been really frustrated because with my asthma and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing","3006":"doctor: i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms patient: i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since","3007":"doctor: okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems patient: it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department","3008":"doctor: wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now patient: i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work","3009":"doctor: okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or patient: yes yes that's the name of it","3010":"doctor: is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that patient: i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well","3011":"doctor: okay and then when you use it at that time does it help patient: it does","3012":"doctor: okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs patient: yeah i take i usually take two puffs","3013":"doctor: okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep patient: yeah for the most part","3014":"doctor: okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er patient: yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then","3015":"doctor: okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those patient: yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone","3016":"doctor: okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing patient: yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days","3017":"doctor: okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay patient: yeah","3018":"doctor: and then when was your last exacerbation patient: probably about a month ago","3019":"doctor: okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that patient: no not really","3020":"doctor: okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center patient: yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again","3021":"doctor: okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis patient: no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana","3022":"doctor: okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all patient: hmmm hmmm","3023":"doctor: okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that patient: sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me","3024":"doctor: okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam patient: okay","3025":"doctor: now i reviewed your vitals for today and your your blood pressure is good it's one twenty eight over eighty two your respiratory rate is sixteen and your oxygen saturation is ninety nine percent on room air which is a good thing i'm gon na take a listen to your heart here your heart is regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any ectopic beats or and i do n't hear anything like rubs murmurs or gallops which is good so i'm gon na go take and listen to your lungs here on your lung exam i do appreciate some diminished lung sounds throughout with the occasional slight expiratory wheeze and that's bilaterally so i hear that on both sides i'm gon na go do a quick neck exam here neck is supple trachea is midline i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy taking a listen here i do n't appreciate any carotid bruit now i'm also gon na take a look at your hands here i note strong bilateral pulses i do n't appreciate any clubbing on any of your fingertips which is which is important and i also note brisk capillary refill i'm gon na go ahead and review the results of your pulmonary function test that i had you do when you came into the office today and reviewing those results i do see that they are consistent with somebody who would be diagnosed with asthma so lem me go ahead and tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so now for your first problem of asthma your symptoms are consistent with moderate to intermediate or i'm sorry moderate moderate intermittent asthma and it's gon na be really important for us to be consistent with your inhaled inhaled steroid inhaler so i'm gon na need you to take that as prescribed and that's really gon na help cut down on those daily symptoms and needing to use that rescue inhaler that albuterol inhaler as frequently so the more you take and more consistently you take your inhaled steroid inhaler the less you will use your albuterol now it's not a fast acting inhaler like your albuterol but what is important is as going to be what helps you long term now if you do have an acute exacerbation so if you're having an acute issue with your breathing i do want you to continue to use your albuterol inhaler one to two puffs and then i want you to wait and see how your breathing is before you would take an additional one to two puffs we hope you have less of those acute exacerbations as you continue to use your inhaled steroid i'm also going to put together an asthma action plan for you and that's gon na help us look at your symptoms see where your your pain points can be you know like those being having issues with with cats or dust that type of thing and we'll work on how to handle those symptoms through that asthma action plan so do you have any questions comments or concerns otherwise i will see you in thirty days patient: alright thank you","3026":"doctor: you're welcome so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan for your first problem of asthma your symptoms are consistent with moderate intermittent asthma i'm gon na start you on flovent one hundred ten micrograms one puff twice per day that's gon na be important for you to be consistent with your inhaled steroid inhaler this is gon na help prevent those daily symptoms and from needing for you to use your albuterol inhaler or that rescue inhaler less frequently you can continue using your ventolin inhaler and that would be two puffs every four to six hours p.r.n . i'm also gon na put together an asthma action plan for you so we know what to do based on your symptoms i'd like to see you again in a month or sooner if you have any worsening symptoms does that sound okay patient: it does thank you","3027":"doctor: you're welcome i'll see you in a month patient: alright thanks","3028":"doctor: hello larry how are you doing today patient: i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you for this back pain that i've been having for a couple of years now","3029":"doctor: i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially patient: you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend","3030":"doctor: okay and now can you describe the pain for me patient: yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe","3031":"doctor: okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain patient: yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot","3032":"doctor: and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area patient: no nothing like that","3033":"doctor: okay now do you have any weakness patient: i would n't say i have any weakness no","3034":"doctor: okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels patient: no","3035":"doctor: okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they patient: so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery","3036":"doctor: okay sure so tell me what is your day like patient: my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years","3037":"doctor: okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf patient: yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back","3038":"doctor: yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right patient: exactly","3039":"doctor: well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions patient: no i ca n't recall any family members","3040":"doctor: okay alright and do you smoke patient: not now i i quit about twenty years ago","3041":"doctor: okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here patient: okay","3042":"doctor: i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit patient: okay that's painful","3043":"doctor: sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that patient: is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time","3044":"doctor: well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year patient: okay okay","3045":"doctor: alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour patient: okay","3046":"doctor: alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection patient: alright thank you","3047":"doctor: alright thank you patient: bye","3048":"doctor: hi kenneth how are you the medical assistant told me that you had some knee pain patient: yeah i was getting ready for the holiday weekend and i was out on my boat skiing and i i did a jump and kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since","3049":"doctor: okay so that was about five days ago then patient: yeah yeah that was last weekend","3050":"doctor: last weekend okay now which knee is it patient: it's my right knee","3051":"doctor: your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened patient: no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards","3052":"doctor: okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance patient: i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore","3053":"doctor: yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before patient: no that was the first time","3054":"doctor: that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake patient: lake martin","3055":"doctor: okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier patient: yeah i try to go every weekend when we can","3056":"doctor: that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day patient: no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway","3057":"doctor: yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked patient: i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days","3058":"doctor: nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing patient: not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it","3059":"doctor: okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all patient: no just the swelling and the pain","3060":"doctor: okay and what have you taken for the pain patient: i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day","3061":"doctor: okay and patient: putting a cold pack on it","3062":"doctor: okay and has that helped at all patient: yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though","3063":"doctor: okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here patient: i had my tonsils out","3064":"doctor: okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press patient: yeah that's sore","3065":"doctor: okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt patient: yeah do n't do that anymore","3066":"doctor: alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that patient: yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan","3067":"doctor: i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions patient: i think so sounds like a good plan to me","3068":"doctor: okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye patient: thank you","3069":"doctor: hey kyle it's nice to see you today can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in patient: yeah i went to see my pcp for a cough which they diagnosed as bronchitis but then they did that chest x-ray to make sure i did n't have pneumonia and they found this lung nodule i went for a cat scan that confirmed it and they referred me here to you i'm really nervous document","3070":"doctor: okay well first of all i'm i'm sorry that you're nervous and what we're gon na do is we're gon na partner together okay and i'm gon na be right by your side the whole time to hopefully make you a little less nervous and and recognize the fact that we're you're gon na have a big support team around you okay patient: okay","3071":"doctor: so let's talk a little bit about how long you've had that cough before you went to see your doctor patient: i you know off and on i've had it for about three months i first noticed it when i was loading some pay i have horses and i i bought you know four hundred bills a day and when i spent a day loading it and then it's i just started coughing a lot more i think around that time and after that i i i just got a cold so that's what sent me to my pcp now i i i do exercise i i do a lot of biking and i typically do n't get sick and my cough has gone away","3072":"doctor: okay that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking i love to bike myself i've got a track seventy one hundred hybrid have you been on the the new trails they opened it was the old the old rail the old rail road right away they've opened that up it's like sixty miles of trails patient: i love that that road i just i i do n't like riding on the road so i prefer to do those rails the trails type","3073":"doctor: yeah i love riding over there way we will we will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride patient: absolutely i'd love it","3074":"doctor: that'd be great so i see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time and and and what do you do to to take care of your ra patient: yeah it's it's it's fair you know arthritis never really goes away but i take methotrexate","3075":"doctor: okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking patient: i stopped smoking probably about seven years ago","3076":"doctor: okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that patient: no not at all","3077":"doctor: okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies patient: no lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer but she is doing well now","3078":"doctor: okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that patient: no no not not anything that i'm aware of","3079":"doctor: okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process patient: no i do n't think so i think i'll be okay i'm scared","3080":"doctor: i i know you're scared but we'll be right here with you the whole way patient: okay","3081":"doctor: alright we'll get some paperwork and i'll see you again in a few minutes patient: okay thank you","3082":"doctor: so tyler is a 56 -year-old male who presents today complaining of difficulty swallowing and has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure so tyler tell me what's going on with your swallowing problem patient: well it's just been something that i have noticed over the last you know four to five weeks it seems like something is always stuck in my throat and you know just i kinda go about my day and it kinda bothers me you know a little bit sometimes a little painful and when i try to eat it just seems like i have to i do n't know when it's something solid i kinda have to wash it down on occasion i i've never really fully choked but i have to admit that i've thought about potentially choking","3083":"doctor: okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing patient: no coughing just kinda when i swallow it's all okay with liquids but when i kinda swallow you know like a bite of a sandwich sometimes it just feels like like i just need a little help pushing it down","3084":"doctor: okay and is it more kind of a like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that patient: i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think it's probably more with solids","3085":"doctor: okay how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids is there is there a temperature change any modification to that patient: it's really just about solids","3086":"doctor: okay alright so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all patient: no","3087":"doctor: okay that so no vomiting blood no coughing up blood or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all patient: not that i want","3088":"doctor: okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this patient: no","3089":"doctor: okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven . four we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going patient: i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise","3090":"doctor: okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all patient: yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time","3091":"doctor: and how are the numbers looking patient: they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting","3092":"doctor: okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that patient: no","3093":"doctor: okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home patient: i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range","3094":"doctor: okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or get you referred to the er if needed any questions about that patient: no that sounds great","3095":"doctor: okay and for the diabetes i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c i'm gon na order some more blood work today we'll check a kidney function and i notice that you have not had an eye referral so i'm gon na also give you an eye referral to ophthalmology to check your eyes for your diabetic for your for any retinopathy continue the metformin i'll have you come back in about a month and that way we'll have the results back for the blood test if we need to make any adjustments we can but i i wan na see you back in about a month and i think that's it for that any questions about that patient: no","3096":"doctor: okay and the high blood pressure i think you're doing great continue with the norvasc if you have any issues certainly call me but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that did we forget anything or do you need refills for anything patient: you know i think i'm low on the norvasc so if you could send something to my pharmacy that would be great","3097":"doctor: okay sure i'll get you a refill for norvasc we'll get that sent over to the pharmacy okay patient: thank you","3098":"doctor: alright thanks good seeing you thanks for coming in to them","3099":"doctor: so jerry is a 45 -year-old male who came in today with an ankle injury jerry what happened patient: hey doctor michael yeah so my son sean i think you met in the past he he started playing basketball and there we do multiple seasons and so we're kinda getting ready for the next season that starts in in april and we were at the courts plan and i went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers i guess he could say and so he he found me while i was going for a lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen","3100":"doctor: absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way patient: he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys","3101":"doctor: good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad patient: yeah yes","3102":"doctor: okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too patient: yeah a little bit","3103":"doctor: okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all patient: yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid","3104":"doctor: sure so it does n't quite feel stable patient: yeah","3105":"doctor: okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches patient: how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach","3106":"doctor: alright well patient: how long","3107":"doctor: yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again patient: okay","3108":"doctor: alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly patient: yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out","3109":"doctor: yeah i i'm a dog walker as well so alright sorry for the bad news but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do patient: alright thank you doctor","3110":"doctor: alright thanks","3111":"doctor: miss edwards is here for evaluation of facial pain this is a 54 -year-old male patient: how're you doing doctor cruz nice to see you today","3112":"doctor: good to see you mister edwards tell me what's been going on patient: yeah so i've got this stabbing shooting pain i've had for a while you know and it it especially right here in my right face right in that cheek bone area it's sometimes it gets super hot i've had it for i think a couple of months now and i went to my family doctor and they said i should come see you","3113":"doctor: okay great i would like to ask you a little bit more about that had in your face do you remember how long that you had it patient: probably for about two or three months just just came on slowly i started noticing it but now it's i have episodes where just shooting stabbing kind of a pain in my right cheek bone right face area","3114":"doctor: mm-hmm do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face patient: not that i've noticed no","3115":"doctor: okay do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face including the other side of your face patient: no it's just on the right side mostly not on the left side just on the right side of my face","3116":"doctor: have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile or while you're doing other things any weakness there patient: not really i mean i've i've i've tried to you know when i smile my smile seems equal on both sides my eyes i do n't have any weakness there my vision seems to be unchanged but just this stabbing severe pain it's just like excruciating pain that i get sometimes","3117":"doctor: does it happen on its own or there are certain things that trigger it patient: sometimes if i'm if certain temperatures seem to trigger it sometimes or if it's super where it's cold i get a trigger sometimes sometimes certain kind of sensory outside of the wind sometimes that seems to trigger it but that's about it","3118":"doctor: okay and anything that you've done to to that helps for a little bit when you pain excess patient: you know i've tried ibuprofen and motrin that had really has n't helped it just comes on suddenly and then it's kinda stabbing excruciating pain i've tried rubbing some you know some tiger balm on it that did n't work but that's you know so i i went to my family doctor and he said you know i really need to see a neurosurgeon","3119":"doctor: got it how long do these episodes last these pain patient: you know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour but generally generally a few minutes","3120":"doctor: any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know patient: no nothing like that","3121":"doctor: alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches patient: i mean i get occasional headaches but not really i do n't have a history of migraines but i occasionally get headaches like everybody else i take some tylenol that usually goes away but this is different","3122":"doctor: how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten patient: when it comes on it's like a ten it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick and but usually you know after a few minutes usually it goes away but sometimes it can last up to an hour","3123":"doctor: great . so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you patient: sure","3124":"doctor: i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth . that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that patient: yep","3125":"doctor: you can hear it on the other side as well patient: yep","3126":"doctor: okay i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay patient: yeah it's a little bit numb on my right side not so much on my left side","3127":"doctor: okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal patient: it feels a little bit dull on my left on my right side my left side it feels sharp","3128":"doctor: alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri patient: okay","3129":"doctor: and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia patient: okay","3130":"doctor: where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face patient: how do we treat it","3131":"doctor: well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve patient: okay","3132":"doctor: most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first . for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve patient: okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or","3133":"doctor: yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this patient: sure","3134":"doctor: it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you patient: okay sounds good let's do it","3135":"doctor: okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain patient: yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not","3136":"doctor: i think one month would be a great time to follow up patient: okay sounds good so if you want to send that prescription over to my pharmacy that would be fine and then why do n't i come back in about a month and we'll go from there","3137":"doctor: great i'll see you then patient: alright","3138":"doctor: hi michelle what's been going on the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee patient: yeah i'm gon na have to keep this my favorite story is that i had a sandra who injured her knee cold dancing so that would immediately came up to mine but let's try skiing so i was skiing in vermont last weekend and i caught my ski when i was coming off the lift and i fell and my knee popped and it's hurt ever since","3139":"doctor: okay and were you able to ski down the hill or did you have to be taken down by the ski patrol patient: i had to be taken down by the ski patrol i was unable to bear weight","3140":"doctor: okay is n't that slightly terrifying they had to do the same thing for me and you're just kind of sitting there watching all of the trees go by so anyway so what part of your knee is bothering you the most is it the inside the outside patient: it hurts on the outside but it also feels like it wo n't hold my weight","3141":"doctor: okay so it feels like it's gon na buckle patient: hmmm yes","3142":"doctor: okay alright and are you able to bend it patient: i was immediately after the injury but not really now","3143":"doctor: okay and how about straightening it are you able to straighten it at all patient: somewhat but it really hurts when i try to straighten all the way","3144":"doctor: okay alright now do you have any numbing or tingling in your toes patient: no","3145":"doctor: okay and can you feel your toes okay patient: i think so","3146":"doctor: okay alright now are you a pretty active person you said you were skiing do you do what kind of other activities do you do patient: i chase my two four -year-old","3147":"doctor: okay do you have twins patient: i do","3148":"doctor: nice that's great patient: yeah","3149":"doctor: so okay and what's your support like at home who is who is able to help out are you still doing that kind of hobbling around on crutches or patient: yeah now my husband is home with me but he also works a job where he is gone quite a bit so it's just me and the kids","3150":"doctor: okay alright and did the ski patrol give you crutches i i see you have them here with you okay alright great and are you otherwise generally healthy patient: yes","3151":"doctor: okay and no high blood pressure diabetes anything like that patient: mm-hmm","3152":"doctor: no okay alright and well i i wan na go ahead let me just do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay alright so on your heart exam your heart sounds in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation and remind me what knee did you injure again patient: my right knee","3153":"doctor: your right knee okay so on your right knee examination i do appreciate some edema and an effusion over the right knee does it hurt when i press patient: yes","3154":"doctor: okay there is pain to palpation of the right lateral knee there is decreased flexion and extension there is a positive lachman sign there is a palpable palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is no leg edema in the ankle okay well let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and you know my plan for you so you know i know that you had the x-ray done of your of your right knee that did n't show any bony abnormality but i i'm concerned that you have ruptured your your acl or your anterior cruciate ligament that's like a major ligament that helps connect and helps your knee move back and forth so i wan na go ahead and order a knee mri just so that we can get a a a good look and just you know confirm that physical exam okay now some people can have a normal physical exam and their acl can still be torn but you do have a lot of pain on the lateral aspect of your knee so i wan na make sure if there make sure that there is not any other structures that have been damaged by this accident okay i wan na go ahead and you know are you what are you taking for the pain patient: ibuprofen","3155":"doctor: is that helping patient: somewhat yes","3156":"doctor: okay alright do you want something stronger patient: no i'm okay","3157":"doctor: alright so let's just continue with ibuprofen you can take you know six hundred to eight hundred milligrams every eight hours as needed i wan na go ahead and put you in a brace that's gon na help your knee feel a bit more supported okay and let's go ahead and i'm hoping that we can get this mri done in you know the next couple days and then we can have a conversation about what needs to be done now you said that you are are are you know obviously a very active active mom any other exercise or anything else that that i should be aware of that you do just wondering in terms of which kind of graft we would use to fix this with your with your acl being injured patient: hmmm no i not i i would like to get back to the running but currently not that active","3158":"doctor: okay alright alright do you have any questions about anything patient: i think you've explained it well","3159":"doctor: okay alright so i'll see you again soon okay patient: okay thank you","3160":"doctor: alright take care bye","3161":"doctor: hey brandon you know glad to see you in here today i see on your chart that you're experiencing some neck pain could you tell me a bit about what happened patient: yeah i was in a car crash","3162":"doctor: wow okay when was that patient: well which car crash","3163":"doctor: okay so multiple car crashes alright so let's see if we can how many let's start patient: my therapist said well my well actually my mother said i should go see the therapist and the therapist said i should see the lawyer but my neck's hurting","3164":"doctor: okay so i'm glad that you know you're getting some advice and so let's let's talk about this neck pain how many car crashes have we had recently patient: well the ones that are my fault or all of them","3165":"doctor: all of them patient: i was fine after the second crash although i was in therapy for a few months and then after the third crash i had surgery but i was fine until this crash","3166":"doctor: okay the most recent crash when was that patient: that's when i was coming home from the pain clinic because my neck hurt and my back hurt but that was in february","3167":"doctor: okay alright so we had a car crash in february patient: what year it was which february it was","3168":"doctor: okay so let's let's try with this one see what happens hopefully you remember i need you to start writing down these car crashes that this is becoming a thing but you know it's okay so let's let's say maybe you had a patient: you're not judging me are you","3169":"doctor: no there's no judgment here whatsoever i want to make sure that i'm giving you the best advise possible and in order to do that i need the most information that you can provide me makes sense patient: yes","3170":"doctor: alright so we're gon na say hope maybe that you had a car crash and we can verify this in february of this year and you've been experiencing some neck pain since then right patient: yes","3171":"doctor: okay alright on a scale of one to ten what ten is your arm is being cut off by a chainsaw severe how bad is your pain patient: twelve","3172":"doctor: okay terrible pain now i know you mentioned you had previous car crashes and you've been to therapy has anyone prescribed you any medication it's you said you went to a pain clinic yes patient: well they had prescribed it recently i was i was on fentanyl","3173":"doctor: okay alright and so we will be able to check on that when you take your medication so before you take your medication rather like are you able to move like are you experiencing any stiffness patient: yes but it hurts","3174":"doctor: okay it hurts what kind of pain is it sharp is it dull is it throbbing patient: it's the sharp incapacitating pain i ca n't work","3175":"doctor: wow okay are you having any headaches patient: of course","3176":"doctor: any dizziness patient: just sometimes","3177":"doctor: any visual disturbances is it hard to like are you patient: not recently no","3178":"doctor: okay alright any numbness patient: yes","3179":"doctor: okay any spasms patient: of course","3180":"doctor: okay where patient: my body hurts i told you my neck hurts","3181":"doctor: okay so i no i'm absolutely i wan na make sure that we are gon na give you the medication that works like the best for you so i'm sorry if these questions seem like frustrating i would just wan na make sure that i understand what the problem is so patient: i saw pamela and doctor collins's office she's much nicer than you know","3182":"doctor: i mean okay so you know what like maybe maybe pamela would be better like we could maybe talk talk about a referral if that would make you more comfortable patient: my lawyer told me to come here","3183":"doctor: then you're stuck with me okay i'm so sorry but here it's we're gon na try and make it as good as possible alright so last thing i do wan na do my physical exam alright and i need you to let me know as as much as you as much as you can verbalize right so when i push here in the middle of your neck on top of the bone does it hurt patient: yes yes","3184":"doctor: okay alright sorry what about on the side does that hurt patient: yes","3185":"doctor: okay so pain on palpation both on the bony process and on the muscle can you move your neck from side to side can you move your neck can you swive it side to side no no alright so i'm i'm seeing i'm seeing some range of movement moderate range of movement that's fine okay i so when can you bend your neck forward that that's your whole body just just the neck are you capable of bending up patient: really hurts it really hurts","3186":"doctor: okay it really hurts to bend forward and backwards okay alright so i'm just gon na make a little note here i do n't i do n't see any bruising i'm not noticing any swelling there is i i do n't see any laceration what patient: just sometimes it bruises","3187":"doctor: okay sometimes alright that's fine i i just i'm not seeing one here today so that's okay alright so with that being said i do wan na ask have you been experiencing any fatigue are you tired patient: well since the accident yes","3188":"doctor: okay alright just making sure okay so this is what this is my assessment and plan this is what we are gon na do i want to be able to like we had you do an x-ray before you came in here and looking at it i'm not noticing any fracture that's a really good sign considering how many car accidents we've been in lately patient: it hurts it hurts","3189":"doctor: absolutely no i we're gon na address the pain so for my first so looking at your imaging results though i'm not seeing a fracture that's a great sign so for your first diagnosis i'm gon na say that you have what is called a neck sprain that patient: thinking are are you saying i'm thinking","3190":"doctor: no not by any means i am saying patient: pain i have a lot of pain","3191":"doctor: yes and your pain can be explained by multiple things but thankfully it's not a broken neck is that okay patient: yes","3192":"doctor: alright so what we are gon na do when we are gon na like try and treat this as conservatively as possible patient: said it might be broken","3193":"doctor: if pamela said it's broken then you know what this is what we're gon na do we're gon na order something called a ct that's gon na give us even nope you know what let's upgrade to an mri it's gon na give us the most thorough image of everything that's going on the heart and the soft tissues is that gon na is that so that way we can really get a good image of what's happening inside right patient: okay because what the lawyer said i needed was an mri","3194":"doctor: not a problem we're we're gon na make your lawyer happy next step we are going to try working like from the outside in so i do need you to work on getting like you're you're saying you've seen some bruising and some swelling yourself so i want you to put ice on that whenever you're experiencing that in the moment when you wake up i want you to do your best to just like i'm gon na give you some exercises on the sheet and i want you to roll through these exercises every morning right to just get some like movement and like free frenosive movement back into your neck i also wan na put you on a couple medications now i know that you said you were on fentanyl before that's a bit extreme and i i want i i i wan na like monitor this a little more conservatively so what we're gon na start with is something called robaxin patient: hurts a lot if i do n't get more fentanyl","3195":"doctor: you know we can refer you to pain medicine if it really is getting that complicated but for this current period we're gon na put you on some robaxin it's gon na be fifteen hundred milligrams and you're gon na take that six to eight hours every six to eight hours and that really should help kinda relax the muscles in the area take off some of that tension and really help with that pain if you're noticing that the robaxin still is n't helping maybe then we can start we can like start using like a heat pad or maybe some icyhot the biofreeze is a really good one to kinda help with that and then we will refer you to physical therapy i think with the mri we can start evaluating maybe some additional steps so rather than you having to like take that fentanyl because i do n't want you to be in danger right like people i do n't want you to get rubbed so what we could explore are local injections right and we can refer you to pain medication and see about like locally injecting the area and that should be able to help you out hopefully with this patient: i ca n't go to work like this","3196":"doctor: okay so if it's if it's that bad let's wait for the mri result we're gon na give you off for work because you know you ca n't move and we'll see what the mri says about what whether or not we can get you like true local injections in the moment is that alright for now patient: yeah","3197":"doctor: okay okay any other questions patient: not right now","3198":"doctor: alright","3199":"doctor: hi , carolyn . how are you ? patient: good . how are you ?","3200":"doctor: i'm good . you're ready to get started ? patient: yes , i am .","3201":"doctor: so carolyn is a 49-year-old female here for follow-up of her chronic problems . so , how are you doing , carolyn ? patient: i'm doing okay . um , my osteoarthritis has been flaring up a little bit lately , um , so i wan na get- talk about that primarily . so , it's mostly in um , my elbows and it's really been bothering me . i've been sitting at the computer , at the desk more , um , in the office so i do n't know if it's being stagnant in that position all day has um , increased flare-ups for that , but i wanted to talk to you about that .","3202":"doctor: okay , sure . and , are you right or left-handed ? patient: i'm right-handed .","3203":"doctor: okay , and does one elbow bother you more than the other ? patient: my right elbow does bother me more than the other , but primarily , i'm typing all day versus writing , so it- it flares up in both .","3204":"doctor: okay . all right , and um , any other joint pain ? patient: no , just- just really focused on my elbows .","3205":"doctor: okay , and any numbing or tingling in your hands ? patient: uh , sometimes . when i'm typing for long periods of time , i feel a little bit of numbing , um , i try to shake out my arms a little bit . um , just to kind of relieve that um , sensation .","3206":"doctor: okay . all right , and i know that you've had this also , had this history of gout . and the last episode you had was about three months ago . you had some inflammation of your toe . have you had any other issues with that ? patient: no , i have n't . um , the medication you gave me really controlled it , and i have n't seen a flare-up since .","3207":"doctor: okay . all right , and how are you doing with your psoriasis ? patient: that's been under control too . that has n't been a- a major problem for me either .","3208":"doctor: okay . i- i know that we had given you some clobetasol for your scalp . is that- so that's doing okay ? patient: yeah , that's doing a lot better .","3209":"doctor: okay , great . um , all right , well , i'd like to go ahead and do a physical exam on you . patient: okay .","3210":"doctor: let's first look at your vital signs . hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . great , so everything looks good from that perspective . um , so looking at you , i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy . your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm , and your lungs sound really clear . on your right elbow , you do have some edema and inflammation of your right olecranon and there's some tenderness and an effusion right there . so um , does that hurt when i press it ? patient: yeah , that does hurt .","3211":"doctor: okay , and when i turn your arm , do you have pain ? patient: yeah , that hurts a bit too .","3212":"doctor: okay , so she has pain- to palpation of the olecranon bursa and pain with pronation and supination . and when you flex- and when you bend it and straighten it , does that hurt ? patient: yeah , it does and it's a bit stiff too .","3213":"doctor: okay , so pain with flexion and extension of the right arm . uh , your abdomen is nice and soft , and there's no lower extremity edema . uh , let's go ahead and take a look at some of your labs . you know , you have a lot of arthritis for someone so young , so we had sent off that autoimmune panel . hey , dragon . show me the autoimmune labs . hey , dragon . show me the autoimmune profile . hey , dragon . show me the esr . okay , so that's good . hey , dragon . show me the uric acid . okay . all right , well , good . that's great . so , you know , it does n't look like you have any systemic arthritis , or sys- systemic inflammatory in process going on . so , my impression of you at this time is that from a gout standpoint , everything is nice and stable . i think that we should continue you on the colchicine 0.6 milligrams twice a day as needed for flare-ups of your gout . um , and then for your osteoarthritis , i'd like to go ahead and order a right elbow x-ray . hey , dragon . order a right elbow x-ray , and then i'd like to prescribe some meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day for the pain and the swelling . patient: okay .","3214":"doctor: hey , dragon . order meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day . and then i'd like to um , just see those- how- the x-ray show- shows up and the results of that before we refer you for any type of physical therapy , okay ? patient: okay .","3215":"doctor: and then from a psoriasis standpoint , i think everything is stable . we'll continue you on the steroid cream for your scalp , okay ? patient: that sounds good .","3216":"doctor: all right , do you have any questions ? patient: no , that's it .","3217":"doctor: all right , take care . patient: thank you .","3218":"doctor: hey , dragon . finalize the note .","3219":"doctor: good afternoon , beverly . good to see you . patient: nice to see you too .","3220":"doctor: so , i know my nurse told you a little bit about dax . um , now , if you do n't mind , i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you . patient: go for it .","3221":"doctor: great . um , beverly's a 24 year old female patient , and i know you have a history of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure . correct ? patient: yep .","3222":"doctor: okay . so , you're here today for your yearly exam . have n't seen you in a year . how're you doing ? patient: i've been doing well . i began working in a bakery this summer which has been super fun. i have really been enjoying working there, but i find myself, since i am so close to so many delicious treats, snacking a lot during shifts and eating a lot more desserts than i normally would.","3223":"doctor: okay , so , that brings me to your diabetes . so , how have your blood sugars been ? patient: uh , not so good .","3224":"doctor: pretty bad lately ? patient: yeah .","3225":"doctor: okay . and , that's really the only thing that's different is your diet , pretty much ? patient: yeah .","3226":"doctor: and , that's because of the new job and all that ? patient: yeah. it has been really challenging to resist the temptation.","3227":"doctor: it's hard to ignore those desserts , are n't they ? patient: yeah .","3228":"doctor: no willpower like me ? patient: no , no willpower .","3229":"doctor: okay . all right . and , and then , um , i know you've had high blood pressure , hypertension . how is , how have your blood sugars been ? have you been checking them ? patient: so , my blood pressure's been good . um , despite my , um , my diabetes levels being up and down .","3230":"doctor: okay , so , your blood pressures have been normal . you've been sleeping well ? patient: yep , getting a full eight hours .","3231":"doctor: no concerns about hurting yourself or anything like that ? patient: no .","3232":"doctor: okay , good . okay , and i know my , um , nurse did a review of systems . other than what we've talked about so far , is there anything else that you needed to add ? patient: no .","3233":"doctor: good . so , pretty much status quo except for those things that we've been working on , right ? patient: yep .","3234":"doctor: okay , good . all right . well , let me do a quick physical exam , okay ? patient: okay .","3235":"doctor: okay , squeeze my finger here . good . can you feel me touch out here ? patient: yep .","3236":"doctor: okay . and , can you feel me touch you down here ? patient: yep .","3237":"doctor: okay . no swelling . push your leg out . good . pull it back . mm-hmm . go . good . okay . so , on my exam , um , essentially , your exam is normal . your , um , heart is regular . you do have that grade 2 , um , systolic ejection fraction back ejection murmur that you , um , that we've heard in the past . okay ? so , um , we definitely know that's there . that's unchanged , okay ? um , your lungs are clear . um , your grips are equal . neurovascular's intact . you do n't have any carotid bruits in your neck , no thyromegaly . no edema . um , pulses are good , so essentially , your exam is , is essentially normal . let's take a look at some of your lab work , okay ? patient: okay .","3238":"doctor: hey , dragon , show me the hemoglobin a1c . okay , so , blood sugars have been elevated . your hemoglobin a1c is elevated as well , so that tells me your blood sugars have been a little bit out of control . you're still taking the metformin , correct ? patient: yes , i am .","3239":"doctor: okay , and you take that twice a day ? patient: yep .","3240":"doctor: okay . um , uh , hey , dragon ? show me the vital signs . okay , good news here is your blood pressure's good . everything , um , there is fine . so , um , so , my assessment is , is , um , your first problem is diabetes . it's a little out of control . we'd like that hemoglobin a1c to be under seven , um , at least . you know , preferably , under six . patient: mm-hmm .","3241":"doctor: so , um , uh , i'm not gon na change your medication . i think this is diet related , so i want you to try to cut down on the snacking and additional sweets , okay ? patient: yeah .","3242":"doctor: and , i want you to check your blood sugars in the morning . i want you to call them in in about two weeks so we know what your first , um , fasting blood sugar was in the morning , and then , we'll come back and see you in about two months and see if everything has straightened out . if it has n't , then we'll talk about adding another medication , okay ? patient: okay .","3243":"doctor: your second problem is your hypertension . that seems to be relatively stable . i want you to stay

you ... hey , dragon , show me the endoscope . all right , so here it looks like , you know ... your endoscopy results look like you had an episode of gastritis . that's for your , your peptic ulcer disease , and so everything , you know ... you took your , your protonix , and i think everything resolved at that point , okay . patient: okay .","3274":"doctor: so , let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you . so for your first problem , this left elbow pain , you know , i think you have olecranon bursitis , and we're just gon na , you know , have you , you know , get a little pillow for your elbow there . it's just caused by repetitive trauma . patient: mm-hmm .","3275":"doctor: so , maybe you're slamming your elbow down a little bit on the desk , so just get a little rest there- patient: yeah .","3276":"doctor: . and we'll give you some melo- meloxicam , 15 mg , once a day . you can ice the area , okay ? um , for your next problem , the epilepsy , sounds

susan , what's going on with your blood pressure ? patient: so , i've always struggled with , um , high blood pressure , but it's seeming to get really out of control lately . so , i wanted to come in and see if there's any type of new medication i can be on to help it get steady or if there is diet restrictions i should take , um , things like that .","3287":"doctor: okay . so , i know that we've had you on the norvasc and we had to increase your dose , so you're on 10 milligrams a day now . and what are your blood pressures running at home ? you c- ... like , have they been like over 150 ? patient: yeah , they have been .","3288":"doctor: okay . all right . and , have you had any headaches ? patient: i have had some headaches . i do n't know if that's just because of more stress at work or , um , because of the high blood pressure .","3289":"doctor: okay . all right . so , you've had some headaches . have you had any chest pain , shortness of breath , anything like that ? patient: no , nothing like that .","3290":"doctor: okay . um , and , you know , i know that you've had a kidney transplant a few years ago . patient: yes .","3291":"doctor: everything is okay with that ? patient:

let's go ahead and we'll do a quick physical exam . so , looking at you , you do n't appear any distress . your neck is nice and supple . your heart is irregular rate and rhythm . i do hear a slight , uh , two out of six systolic ejection murmur . your lungs are clear . i do see the scar on the left , uh , left plank for your kidney transplant which is healed . and you have no lower extremity edema . so , let's go ahead and look at some of your results , okay ? patient: okay .","3294":"doctor: hey , dragon , show me the creatinine . so , your kidney function looks really good . so , that's really promising after your transplant . hey , dragon , show me the ekg . and your ekg looks great , uh , perfectly normal , so that's good . um , so , my impression of you at this time ... , let me see your blood pressure . patient: okay .","3295":"doctor: hey , dragon , show me the blood pressure . yeah , and you're right , it- patient: hm .","3296":"doctor: . it is high . so , there is something that we can do for that . so , let's go ahead and we'll put you on ... so , my impression of you is that your , your blood pressure is high and the norvasc is n't controlling it . and , you know , we can definitely get it under better control . so , what i would like to do is prescribe you coreg 25 milligrams , twice a day . and that will help bring your blood pressure down , okay ? patient: okay .","3297":"doctor: hey , dragon , order carvedilol 25 milligrams , twice a day . uh , i'd also like to go ahead and , uh , get a lipid panel and some routine labs on you just to make sure that everything is okay . patient: yeah .","3298":"doctor: hey , dragon , order a lipid panel . hey , dragon , order a complete metabolic panel . all right . and then , um , from a transplant standpoint , everything looks fine . your kidney function looks great , so we're just gon na continue you on all of those medications .so , the nurse will come in soon and she'll help you schedule all of the al- schedule a follow-up appointment with me , and we'll see what your blood pressure looks like in a couple weeks after taking that medication . okay ? patient: okay .","3299":"doctor: all

hey dragon , i'm seeing mrs. lee today for , uh , back pain . she's a 40-year-old female . so can you tell me what happened to you ? patient: yes . i was at a birthday party and it was surprise party . so we were all like crunched behind and hiding . and when the person came in we all jumped out , and then i fell down the little stair and i rammed my back into the railing of the s- , uh , staircase .","3303":"doctor: so it was a surprise for you too ? patient: yes it was .","3304":"doctor: very good . okay . so , um , did it hurt because you hit it , or did you twist ? what happened when you ? patient: i think it was my motion-","3305":"doctor: okay . any pain shooting down your legs at all ? patient: no .","3306":"doctor: is it on one side or the other of your back ? patient: um , it's more on the right .","3307":"doctor: on the right . is there anything that makes it better or worse ? patient: uh , if i'm lying flat it hurts a little more , and any twisting motion for sure .","3308":"doctor: okay . all right . and do you have any history or any back problems before ? patient: i did . i had a fusion done .","3309":"doctor: okay , yeah that lumbar fusion . um , let's take an x-ray . hey . or let's look at an x-ray . hey dragon , show me the latest x-ray . okay , we can see where you had your fusion , t4 here on the x-ray . but i do n't see anything that looks , um , significantly abnormal . it does n't appear to have any compression fractures or anything like that . so , it's essentially , except for the fusion , a normal exam . let me do your exam for you here . can i have you stand up please ? does it hurt when i twist you that way ? patient: yes .","3310":"doctor: okay . you can sit back down . if i lift your leg here , does that bother you ? patient: no .","3311":"doctor: how 'bout when i lift this leg ? patient: no .","3312":"doctor: any pain shooting down your legs when i do that ? patient: no .","3313":"doctor: okay . and can you feel me touching down here . patient: yes .","3314":"doctor: okay , great . so , you had a injury to your back when you were twisting at the birthday party . you do n't really have any pain or numbness down your legs . you have some stiffness with rotation , um , but you do n't have any evidence of a , um , what we would call a pinched nerved or radiculopathy . so , i think you basically have a strain of your lower back . um , have you been taking any medications ? patient: just some ibuprofen .","3315":"doctor: okay . and do you have any other , um , medical problems ? patient: um i take medication for anxiety .","3316":"doctor: okay . and that's all ? okay . um , so what we're gon na do is i'm gon na give you , um , just continue the motrin at 800mg , three times a day , with food . i want you to use some ice and heat , alternating on your back . but i do want you walking . patient: okay .","3317":"doctor: um , and , uh , this should sort of take care of itself after a few days . if it's not , or it's getting worse , i want you to come back and see me over the next week . patient: okay .","3318":"doctor: does that sound good ? patient: it does .","3319":"doctor: okay , dragon . hey dragon ,

patient: nice to see you too .","3321":"doctor: so , my nurse told you a little bit about dax , now i'm wondering if i can tell dax a little bit about you . patient: go for it .","3322":"doctor: okay , so rebecca is a 27-year-old female patient . um , you have a history of carpal tunnel , um , uh , release done couple of years ago , you have some chronic back pain , some depression . why am i seeing you today ? patient: so last week , um , and over the course of the month , i have taken up swimming more regularly .","3323":"doctor: just in your right knee ? patient: yeah .","3324":"doctor: okay . just when swimming ? are you swimming freestyle with your legs kicking straight or more like breaststroke where your legs kick out ? patient: yeah , it's only while swimming. i use the breaststroke so i guess where the legs are kicking out like a frog ... it kinda starts hurting a little bit after i swim a couple laps , which a month ago when i started i was able to do ten .","3325":"doctor: and no injury ? like you did n't fall or twist it or anything like that that you remember ? patient: no , not that i can remember .","3326":"doctor: okay . so just swimming a lot and you feeling more and more discomfort ? patient: yeah .","3327":"doctor: okay , good . so , um ... i know my nurse did a review of systems before you came in . there were really no significant issues . you have a history of chronic back pain , that's been doing well ? patient: yeah , it comes and goes , but right now it's been doing really well .","3328":"doctor: okay , no pain going down your legs or anything like that ? patient: no .","3329":"doctor: okay . and i know you have some depression , you've been on medication . how's that been going ? patient: that's been going really well .","3330":"doctor: sleeping well ? patient: yeah .","3331":"doctor: eating well ? okay . do n't feel any concerns about hurting yourself or others or anything like that ? patient: no .","3332":"doctor: okay , good . um , and the , you had ca- carpal tunnel done a few years ago . how's that doing ? patient: that's doing-","3333":"doctor: any flare up with that ? patient: . that's doing really well . i've been getting full range of motion and it's felt a lot better .","3334":"doctor: okay , great . do you mind if i do a quick exam ? patient: yeah , go for it .","3335":"doctor: squeeze my fingers for me . good . okay . is it painful if i move your patella like that ? patient: yeah , that hurts .","3336":"doctor: okay . and i'm gon na hold your leg out , i'm gon na hold , i want you to stiffen your upper ... does that hurt when i do that ? patient: yeah , that hurts too .","3337":"doctor: okay , good , all right . um , let's take a quick look at your x-ray , okay ? patient: okay .","3338":"doctor: hey dragon , show me the right knee x-ray . okay , so here's a picture of your right knee . actually normal x-ray , everything looks good , okay ? on my exam , um , you do n't really have any swelling in- in your joints , um , uh , of your knee . you have a little pain with , um , uh , range of motion of the knee . you have real pain when we do what we call patella in- ... patellar inhibition , okay ? so that's what caused most of that pain . so , um , your heart is regular , your lungs are clear , i do n't feel any adenopathy , your thyroid's , um , normal , your grips are equal , the rest of your exam is essentially normal , okay ? so my assessment is , you have what we call chondromalacia of the patella , okay ? it's just from the overuse and all- all the swimming you've been doing , okay ? so , um , to treat that we'll just use some anti-inflammatories , um , go ahead and take some ibuprofen , 600 milligrams four times a day with food . i do want you to do some straight leg raising exercises , that'll strengthen your quadriceps and that'll help with that pain , okay ? patient: okay .","3339":"doctor: um , basically you want to avoid anything that puts extra pressure on your knees for a little while and it should be fine . if it's not getting any better in a couple weeks i wan na see you again , okay ? so no lunges , avoid the breaststroke . if you're comfortable, you can also do other swimming strokes where your knees are straight instead . or you can take the opportunity to have a little break . patient: all right .","3340":"doctor: your second problem is your chronic back pain , that's been doing really well . um , keep swimming , that's okay after this gets better . patient: yeah .","3341":"doctor: um , but i think , um , i think that's been under control . but if it flares up go ahead and , uh , give me a call , okay ? patient: mm-hmm .","3342":"doctor: um , your third problem is your depression . that's been stable . we're gon na keep you on your current medication , not gon na change anything at this point , okay ? and as far as your carpal tunnel goes , that's relatively stable , so , um , uh , no changes there as well . okay ? so anything else i can do for you ? patient: no , that's it .","3343":"doctor: okay , well we'll get you checked out . patient: all right .","3344":"doctor: hey dragon , finalize the report .","3345":"doctor: we're gon na go right to the front- . so when you touch that- hi , michelle , how are you ? patient: i'm good . how are you ?","3346":"doctor: i'm good . so i know the nurse told you about dax . i'd like to dax a little bit about you , okay ? patient: okay .","3347":"doctor: all right . so , michelle is a 31-year-old female with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension who presents with abnormal lab finding . so , michelle , it came back to me that you had had a positive long ... lyme titer . patient: yeah .","3348":"doctor: and so , uh , can you , you , you know , can you tell me a little bit about it ? i know the last time i saw you , you had had an insect bite , and you know , it came back positive for lyme . so how are you feeling ? patient: i've been feeling ... i could feel better . um ... i've been feeling tired , um , really lacking a lot of energy , and i have swollen joints in my elbows , just really hurts

i've been a little nauseous . i have n't been able to eat much . i've been trying just to keep , you know , toast and crackers and that's all about i've been able to stomach , really .","3351":"doctor: okay , and , and i know that you had had that , that , uh , bite there . have you noticed any other rash anywhere else ? patient: yeah , i have .","3352":"doctor: okay . all right . sometimes they kind of describe it as looking as like a bull's-eye . patient: yes .","3353":"doctor: is that what it looked like ? patient: mm-hmm .","3354":"doctor: okay . all right . well , um , have you had any , any high fevers ? patient: uh , no , not that i've noticed .","3355":"doctor: all right . um , and how about from a diabetes standpoint ? how ... how's your blood sugar been running

little low . um , but nothing too far out of range .","3356":"doctor: okay . all right . um , and you're still taking the metformin ? patient: yes .","3357":"doctor: okay . all right . good . and then in terms of your high blood pressure , are you monitoring the blood pressures at home ? patient: yeah , i , i have a ... i bought a cuff last year , and i've been , um , taking it myself at home . those have looked good . i've been staying away from the salty foods .","3358":"doctor: mm-hmm . patient: um , so that's been good .","3359":"doctor: okay . and , um , so you're still taking the lisinopril ? patient: yes .","3360":"doctor: okay , great . all right , well , you know , i know that you did the review of systems sheet when you checked in , and i know that you're endorsing some nausea and some joint pain and some body aches . any other symptoms ? abdominal pain ? diarrhea ? anything like that ? patient: no , nothing like that .","3361":"doctor: okay . um , so let's go ahead , and we'll ... i'm gon na do a quick physical exam . patient: okay .","3362":"doctor: hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . so i'm looking here at your vital signs . they look great . you do n't have a fever at that ... at this time , so that's really encouraging . i'm just gon na check you out , and , uh , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs and look for any rashes and let you know what i find , okay ? patient: okay .","3363":"doctor: okay , so on physical examination , you know , you do have some swelling of your , uh , elbow joints bilaterally . um , does it hurt when i touch them ? patient: yeah , it does .","3364":"doctor: okay , so she has pain to palpation to both elbow joints . um , and on your skin examination , you do have a bull's-eye rash on your , um , abdomen on the left-hand side . um , it's , it's warm to palpation . any pain with that ? patient: no , no pain for that .","3365":"doctor: non-tender to palpation , no evidence of cellulitis . um , and the rest of , you know , the rest of your exam is pretty normal , okay ? so let me just go over some of the results with you , okay ? patient: okay .","3366":"doctor: hey , dragon , show me the lyme titer . so you can see here , you know , in reviewing the results of your lyme titer , it is elevated . so we're gon na go ahead and do some further testing , but we're gon na , you know , we're gon na look into that , okay ? patient: okay .","3367":"doctor: hey , dragon , show me the labs . and in reviewing the results of your labs , everything else looks good . so again , you know , you do n't have an elevated white blood cell count or anything like that . so i think we got this early enough , and we can go ahead and , and treat it , okay ? patient: okay .","3368":"doctor: so i wan na talk a little bit about , you know , my assessment and my plan for you . so for your first problem , this newly diagnosed lyme disease , i wan na go ahead and prescribe you doxycycline , 100 milligrams twice a day

problem , your high blood pressure . it looks today like everything is fine . i think you're doing a really good job of managing your hypertension , and i'm going to continue you on the lisinopril ,

blood sugar . patient: yes . so , i've been eating a ton of sweets recently . with the holidays it just feels like there is always something sweet available. whether i am at work and there are holiday gift baskets or clients bringing in treats or when i visit my family for the holidays and there is every baked good imaginable, there is always something sweet i can be eating. in the beginning i felt fine, but i have started to feel it after a couple of weeks, and this past week i just felt really light-headed and i could ... was seeing spots , really dizzy . so i went into the emergency room and they said i had a high blood sugar . um , so i wanted to come in and follow up with you to get that , um , get checked out .","3379":"doctor: okay . all right . and how , how are you feeling now ? did they , did , did they treat you in the emergency room ? did they gi- they give you some iv fluids and things like that ? patient: yeah . they gave me some fluids and they told me just to try to really cut out eating any extra sweets and get back into my normal routine and diet, but i am still staying with my family, and my mom and grandmother are big bakers so i think it will be really hard to get into a routine there so i just want to make sure i am nipping this high blood sugar thing in the bud.","3380":"doctor: okay . and i saw you went through a review of systems sheet with a nurse . i just want to ask you a few more questions from that standpoint . so you have had any fever or chills ? patient: no .","3381":"doctor: any chest pain or shortness of breath ? patient: n- uh , no .","3382":"doctor: abdominal pain ? patient: no .","3383":"doctor: any burning when you urinate ? patient: no .","3384":"doctor: any joint pain or muscle aches ? patient: no .","3385":"doctor: perfect . um , and then , i know that you have this history of a-fib , atrial fibrillation . have you felt your heart racing at all , recently ? patient: only when i'm really anxious . i , i feel it , um , pumping a little bit . but other than that i have n't .","3386":"doctor: okay . all right . and how are you doing with your reflux ? patient: i've been doing well . i've been taking the medication that you prescribed to me and that's been helping a lot .","3387":"doctor: okay , yeah . i see here you're on the protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day . patient: yes .","3388":"doctor: so that's , you're doing well with that ? patient: yep .","3389":"doctor: okay . all right . so let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam . so , listening to you , um , look , or looking at you , you appear in no distress . your thyroid is a little enlarged , but non-tender . there's no carotid bruits , your heart is in irregular rate and rhythm , and your lungs are clear . your abdomen is nice and soft , and you have no edema in your lower extremities . let's go ahead and look at some of your test results . patient: okay .","3390":"doctor: hey , dragon ? show me the blood sugar . hey , dragon ? show me the blood glucose . hey , dragon ? show me the hemoglobin a1c . okay , so i see here that both your blood sugar and your hemoglobin a1c are elevated . so your blood sugars have probably been running high for probably a few months . okay ? um , let's go ahead and look at some of your other results . hey , dragon ? show me the diabetes labs . yeah . okay . yeah , so , um , my impression of you at this time , um , for your high blood sugars , that you do have this diagnosis of diabetes . now , we're not sure if it's type i or type ii . even patients in , you know , in their mid-twenties can develop type i diabetes , so we're gon na go off and , we're gon na go ahead and , and send some labs to work that up . hey , dragon ? order a complete metabolic panel . and i'd like to start you on metformin , 500 milligrams , twice a day . that will help keep your blood sugars down . patient: okay .","3391":"doctor: hey , dragon ? order metformin , 500 milligrams , twice a day . and then if some of the autoimmune labs that come back show that you have an autoimmune disorder , meaning that you would have type i diabetes , then we would have to go ahead and put you on insulin . but i'm gon na hold off until we have those results , okay ? patient: okay .","3392":"doctor: but in the meantime , i really want you to avoid , uh , foods high in sugar . um , and the , the nurse will come in and she'll give you a glucometer and teach you how to do blood sugar testing . okay ? patient: okay .","3393":"doctor: and then , from an atrial fibrillation standpoint , your heart , even though you're in atrial fibrillation right now , is in a good rate . and we'll just continue you on your metoprolol , 25 milligrams , twice a day . do you need a refill on that ? patient: yes , i do .","3394":"doctor: hey , dragon ? order a refill on metoprolol , 25 milligrams , twice a day . and for your reflux , we'll just continue you on the protonix , okay ? patient: okay .","3395":"doctor: do you have any questions , hannah ? patient: no , not at this time .","3396":"doctor: okay , so the nurse will come in and she'll go over all that stuff with you . patient: okay .","3397":"doctor: take care . patient: thank you .","3398":"doctor: hey , dragon ? finalize the note .","3399":"doctor: hi janet , how are you ? patient: good , how are you ?","3400":"doctor: i'm good . uh , are you ready to get started ? patient: yes .","3401":"doctor: okay . so , janet is a 33-year-old female , here for some , some joint paint . what , what joint's been bothering you , janet ? patient: it's been mostly , um , my knees , actually . i've been doing more stair type workouts , which i thought was , you know , building muscle , uh , on my knees and supposed to help .","3402":"doctor: mm-hmm . patient: but in turn it , it really has n't , so my knees have been really bothering me .","3403":"doctor: okay . all right . and is it one knee versus the other ? or both equally ? patient: it's both equally .","3404":"doctor: okay . and have you been having any other joint pain like , elbows or shoulder , or anything like that ? patient: no , but i , i should mention that like , i had a rotator cuff repair about two years ago .","3405":"doctor: mm-hmm . patient: um , but i have n't had any problems since that point .","3406":"doctor: okay , and what shoulder was that ? patient: that was my right shoulder .","3407":"doctor: okay , all right . and , um , any pins and needles in your feet at all ? any swelling in your legs ? patient: uh , no , nothing like that .","3408":"doctor: okay , and your blood sugars have been under control ? patient: yes , they have been .","3409":"doctor: okay . and have you had any fever or chills ? patient: no , nothing like that .","3410":"doctor: okay . any nausea or vomiting , chest pains , shortness of breath ? patient: no , but i do have high blood pressure , um , but i , i monitor that and i've been taking medication for that , and that has n't elevated , um , in any way since the joint pain .","3411":"doctor: okay . all right . so , yeah , i see on here that you do take norvasc , five mg a day and you've been taking that every day- patient: yes .","3412":"doctor: okay . um , and , um , so let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you . so , hey dragon , show me the blood pressure . your blood pressure's actually pretty high today , so you might be a little nervous here , which is not uncommon . patient: yeah .","3413":"doctor: um , so , looking at you , your , your neck is nice and soft , there's no enlarged thyroid . your heart has a regular rate and rhythm . your lungs are clear . your abdomen is nice and soft , but looking at your knees , on your left knee you do have a slight erythema and edema . there is a small efusion present over your left knee . um , you have some decrease flexion and extension of your knee , but your strength in your lower extremities is good . uh , so let's go ahead and look at some of your results . i know that we did some x-rays when you came in . patient: yeah .","3414":"doctor: hey dragon , show me the left knee x-ray . okay , so looking at this , this is an , this is a normal x-ray of your left knee , so you may just have a little bit of a strain going on in your , in your knees there . patient: okay .","3415":"doctor: uh , let's look at some of your labs , 'cause i know that you have the diabetes . hey dragon , show me the labs . so , here your white blood cell count is not elevated , so i'm not concerned about an infection or anything like that . um , hey dragon , show me the diabetes' labs . okay and , and your a1c is a little elevated , but it's not , it's not terrible , so i think for right now we'll just continue you on the current regimen . um , so my plan from you , for you in terms of the joint pain , um , i'd like to go ahead and , you know , we'll just send some autoimmune labs to work , work up your left knee pain and , uh , we'll work for you to do some physical therapy and i'd like to go ahead and give you anti-inflammatory medication to help with the pain . does that sound okay ? patient: that sounds great .","3416":"doctor: okay . hey dragon , order meloxicam 15 mg once a day . hey dragon , order a physical therapy referral . hey dragon , order an autoimmune profile . and then from a hypertension standpoint you , because your blood pressure is a little elevated today , i'd like you to continue to monitor it at home and , you know , send me a report in the next couple of weeks sh- , you know , giving me the , the blood pressure reportings . do you have a blood pressure cuff at home ? patient: yes , i do .","3417":"doctor: okay . and then , um , we'll go ahead and order a lipid profile for you . hey dragon , order a lipid profile . and then for , from a diabetes standpoint let's go ahead and , uh , continue you on your metformin 500 mg twice a day . okay ? patient: okay .","3418":"doctor: do you have any questions ? patient: no , that's it .","3419":"doctor: okay . the nurse will be in soon . it was good to see you . patient: nice seeing you too .","3420":"doctor: hey dragon , finalize the note .","3421":"doctor: morning christine , nice to see you . patient: nice to see you too .","3422":"doctor: so i know my nurse told you a little bit of- ... um , about dax and i'm gon na tell dax a little bit about you , if that's okay ? patient: go for it .","3423":"doctor: okay , great . um , uh , this is christine . she's a 63-year-old female patient . you're here for your routine , um , yearly exam . um , i know you have a history of high blood pressure and you've had some depression in the past . and i also know you did have a carpal tunnel release done about two years ago . um , how have you been doing ? patient: i've been doing well . um , the depression standpoint is doing great . i've been using , um , the medication you prescribed me last time and going to therapy every week . and that's really helped me manage .","3424":"doctor: okay . and you're sleeping well at night ? and everything's been going well from that standpoint ? patient: yeah , i've been getting a full eight hours .","3425":"doctor: okay . and no thoughts of hurting yourself or anything like that ? patient: no .","3426":"doctor: okay , good . um , and , um , i- i know you've had some high blood pressure in the past . have you been checking your blood pressure ? patient: i have . it's been a little bit up and down-","3427":"doctor: has n't really stayed put ? patient: yeah .","3428":"doctor: okay . and , um , you've been talking your medication though , right ? patient: yes , i have .","3429":"doctor: and have you had any headaches or swelling or anything like that that's been abnormal ? patient: i have some headaches but i just thought that was looking at a computer screen all day .","3430":"doctor: okay , well , that's fair . patient: yeah , exactly .","3431":"doctor: okay good . and , um ... i know my nurse did a review of systems . other than what we've just talked about , has there been anything else that you wanted to add to that ? patient: um , my carpal tunnel release has been doing well . on , uh , we did that , i think it was two years ago now .","3432":"doctor: great , great . no numbness or tingling in your hands ? patient: no .","3433":"doctor: fingers ? okay , good . all right , well , um , lem me do a quick exam if that's okay ? patient: okay .","3434":"doctor: deep breath . squeeze my fingers for me . feel me touch you here ? patient: yup .","3435":"doctor: can you touch down here ? patient: mm-hmm .","3436":"doctor: can you push your leg out ? push this one up . pull it back . yeah , good . okay . so on my exam , um ... your exam's essentially normal , your lungs are clear , are- ... you do n't have any adenopathy in your neck , you do n't have any , um , uh , hyperthyroidism . um , your heart is regular without any murmurs . um , your grips are equal , neurologically intact , strength is good , pulses are good . so overall , um , your exam is fine . let's take a- a look at some of your labs and vital signs . patient: okay .","3437":"doctor: hey dragon , show me the blood pressure . okay , so here in the office today it is a little bit elevated , okay ? so your blood pressure is a little bit high . so the results , um , do show that . um , hey dragon , show me the labs . okay , so good news is is your- your labs are all essentially normal , so the results of your labs are essentially normal , okay ? so ... um , my assessment is that your- ... you do have hypertension still . um , and i think we need to increase your blood pressure medicine a little bit , okay ? so i'm gon na increase your lisinopril to 10 milligrams a day , just once a day , um , but i'm gon na increase that a little bit , okay ? and then want you to check it and i'm gon na have you come back in a month and we'll see how you're doing with regards to that , okay ? patient: okay .","3438":"doctor: um , your second problem is your dep- depression , you're doing great , i do n't wan na change anything at this point . let's just stay- ... we'll change one thing with your high blood pressure- patient: mm-hmm .","3439":"doctor: so i do n't wan na change any other medications at this point in time , so let's just leave that as it is . patient: okay .","3440":"doctor: and then your third problem was your carpal tunnel . that seems to be doing well . if you notice any tingling or any changes or you get some of those symptoms back , just let me know . okay ? patient: okay .","3441":"doctor: all right . anything else i can do for you today ? patient: no , that's it .","3442":"doctor: okay . great . uh , lem me get you checked out . patient: okay .","3443":"doctor: hey dragon , finalize the report .","3444":"doctor: next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation . hi emily , how are you ? patient: i'm pretty good , how are you ?","3445":"doctor: i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ? patient: yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .","3446":"doctor: okay , and that's the 250\/50 dose , correct ? patient: yes , correct .","3447":"doctor: perfect . so how does that compare ? patient: i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .","3448":"doctor: and that's one puff twice a day ? patient: mm-hmm .","3449":"doctor: okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ? patient: rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .","3450":"doctor: so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity . patient: yes .","3451":"doctor: okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ? patient: yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .","3452":"doctor: no kidding , that's great . patient: yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .","3453":"doctor: really ? patient: yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .","3454":"doctor: and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ? patient: mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .","3455":"doctor: and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ? patient: probably about three or four .","3456":"doctor: okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ? patient: yes , that's correct .","3457":"doctor: okay , and do you think that's working okay ? patient: i do .","3458":"doctor: great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ? patient: nope .","3459":"doctor: okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then . patient: nope .","3460":"doctor: okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ? patient: so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .","3461":"doctor: now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ? patient: correct .","3462":"doctor: okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ? patient: yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .","3463":"doctor: do you use it more just as needed in the summer ? patient: yeah , that's right .","3464":"doctor: okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ? patient: not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .","3465":"doctor: and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ? patient: yeah , it does , it works great .","3466":"doctor: wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ? patient: yep , that's correct .","3467":"doctor: okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ? patient: no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .","3468":"doctor: super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it . patient: yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .","3469":"doctor: okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ? patient: yes .","3470":"doctor: okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year . patient: yeah , okay .","3471":"doctor: and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ? patient: i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .","3472":"doctor: okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards . patient: okay .","3473":"doctor: and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment . patient: all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .","3474":"doctor: it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape . patient: okay .","3475":"doctor: yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point . patient: all right , that sounds good .","3476":"doctor: well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me . patient: okay .","3477":"doctor: all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh . patient: ahh .","3478":"doctor: good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on . patient: okay .","3479":"doctor: and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good . patient: awesome .","3480":"doctor: so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ? patient: i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .","3481":"doctor: yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ? patient: correct .","3482":"doctor: okay . most insurances do limit what we can use . patient: yeah i do know that .","3483":"doctor: okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med . patient: mm-hmm","3484":"doctor: so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much . patient: okay .","3485":"doctor: that we had too much , yeah . patient: okay .","3486":"doctor: um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco . patient: okay , that actually sounds really good .","3487":"doctor: okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day . patient: all right","3488":"doctor: okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you . patient: okay , got it .","3489":"doctor: and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests . patient: okay .","3490":"doctor: is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ? patient: yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .","3491":"doctor: okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well . patient: awesome , thank you .","3492":"doctor: you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ? patient: i just get it over the counter .","3493":"doctor: okay got it . and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ? patient: i do n't think i need any refills , i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis , or there was few select times when i had to use it when i was kid .","3494":"doctor: okay good . well i think we have our game plan . patient: okay awesome .","3495":"doctor: and do the alvesco two puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it . the zyrtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen . patient: okay","3496":"doctor: all right so we've got it . patient: great .","3497":"doctor: all right i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say four months re-check for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer- spirometry at that time . patient: okay sounds good .","3498":"doctor: all right well thanks so much and you have a great day . patient: you too .","3499":"doctor: and we'll do a follow-up in four months with act and spirometry , sooner if needed . follow-up 25 minutes .","3500":"doctor: all right , new patient , jordan roberts . date of birth : 3\/2\/1972 . he's a 49 year old , uh hm , with hypertension and palpitations . please copy forward his thyroid profile from march 1st , 2021 . hello mr. roberts , how are you doing today ? patient: i'm fine , thank you .","3501":"doctor: good . good . so , i saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations . patient: yeah . that was back in march i think , but my girlfriend and i , we talked about it , and on that day i had a few cups of coffee , and no breakfast . so , i think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else .","3502":"doctor: yeah . have you , uh , have you felt it again since ? patient: uh , no .","3503":"doctor: okay . uh , so tell me about the blood pressure then . patient: well , i've had issues with my blood pressure since i was young .","3504":"doctor: do you have a family history of this ? patient: yeah . a lot of my family does have high blood pressure .","3505":"doctor: uh , can you tell me which medications you're taking ? patient: my new med is , uh , a combo med , something 40-25 .","3506":"doctor: okay . um . yes , i see that in your chart . the benicar hct . it has hydrochlorothiazide in it . patient: yeah , that's it . my water pill i call it .","3507":"doctor: okay . are you still taking the amlodipine , 10 milligrams daily ? patient: uh , yes i am .","3508":"doctor: that's- that's a good start on a regimen . are you checking your blood pressure at home , and if yes , what numbers are you seeing ? patient: um , every day .","3509":"doctor: awesome . patient: yeah . every morning , i take it when i get up , and it's been running at about , uh , 146 to 155 lately .","3510":"doctor: so you're not down in the 120s yet ? patient: no , not yet . well , we're trying to get there though .","3511":"doctor: okay . uh , how are you doing with your salt intake ? patient: i'm trying to back off of it . i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .","3512":"doctor: good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure . patient: sounds good .","3513":"doctor: are you doing any exercise ? patient: i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .","3514":"doctor: okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look . patient: all right .","3515":"doctor: uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented . patient: okay .","3516":"doctor: so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good . patient: all right .","3517":"doctor: your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great . patient: good to hear .","3518":"doctor: all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts . patient: nope . nowhere .","3519":"doctor: all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling . patient: all right .","3520":"doctor: all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ? patient: uh , no .","3521":"doctor: okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone . patient: okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?","3522":"doctor: um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try . patient: all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .","3523":"doctor: okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room . patient: all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .","3524":"doctor: yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay . patient: all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?","3525":"doctor: uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon . patient: i'll definitely let you know if that happens .","3526":"doctor: okay . uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better . um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged . um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure . patient: i understand .","3527":"doctor: yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure . patient: okay .","3528":"doctor: um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise . um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure . patient: really ? i did n't realize that .","3529":"doctor: yeah , yeah . it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium . um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that . um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information . um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff . patient: okay . i'll definitely check that out .","3530":"doctor: all right . so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes . uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic . patient: all right .","3531":"doctor: all right . so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension . they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up . when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure . patient: that's interesting .","3532":"doctor: yeah . so , that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points . um , there are of course some risks , so not everyone is a candidate . uh , but we'll cross that road , uh , when we need to , and let's just- let's just see how you do with the addition of the medication . patient: sounds good to me .","3533":"doctor: all right . so , we will see you in two weeks then . patient: sounds good . thanks doc .","3534":"doctor: yeah , you're welcome . let me know if you have any questions . patient: will do .","3535":"doctor: all right . have a great day mr. roberts . patient: you too .","3536":"doctor: mr. roberts presents with resistant hypertension . he's on three meds and maximum dose . i have added spironolactone to his regiment . we will need to monitor his potassium and sodium . he will have a metabolic panel and blood pressure check in two weeks . uh , next medication would be carvedilol , uh , which i try to avoid giving , it's potential for erectile dysfunction . i have talked to the patient about that , and the potential side effects of spironolactone , including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances . if he is not controlled on spironolactone , the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic .","3537":"doctor: brittany edwards , 07 , 1898 . she is a return visit for ibs with functional abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting . ms. edwards is a pleasant , 32-year-old female who was last seen in august of 2019 with flares of abdominal pain , who was diagnosed with irritable bowl that was treated with bentyl . she had a previous prescription for reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea . she was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement , such as citrucel , daily , probiotics to help with gas and bloating , bentyl up to four times daily for intestinal cramping , and stop reglan and use zofran as needed . neuromodulators such as elavil and buspar were discussed but not started . hello , how are you ? patient: i'm okay .","3538":"doctor: good . how have you been feeling ? patient: not so good .","3539":"doctor: yeah , so my nurse told me you have been going out to eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp . patient: yeah , i have .","3540":"doctor: okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that . patient: no , it does n't like it at all .","3541":"doctor: yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol . and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps , or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea . patient: i've been getting both .","3542":"doctor: okay . um , so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ? patient: i'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day .","3543":"doctor: okay . and are they soft stools or formed stools ? patient: um , they're formed .","3544":"doctor: okay . and after you have gone out either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ? patient: yeah , i do .","3545":"doctor: okay . do you feel it's the food or the alcohol or both ? patient: uh , well usually we go to friday's restaurant . i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo .","3546":"doctor: okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce . patient: but it normally does n't bother me .","3547":"doctor: okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ? patient: no .","3548":"doctor: okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ? patient: most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer patron , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . um , every now and again , i'll drink a martini .sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks , but it can be a variety of things .","3549":"doctor: um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ? patient: um , no . i guess i need to find a new drink .","3550":"doctor: okay . and how is it during the week ? patient: like what i eat ?","3551":"doctor: yeah , and with the diarrhea and abdomal- um , abdominal pain . patient: right now , i'm still having the cramping and sharp pains , so i've been avoiding heavy foods . i did have some fried chicken today , though .","3552":"doctor: and was everything all right after that ? patient: yeah , for the most part .","3553":"doctor: okay . remember , it's also the portion sizes . so i mean , if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay . you have to just really watch the portions . patient: okay , good . i ca n't go out- go without some fried chicken at least once in a while .","3554":"doctor: sounds good . all right , well let's take a look at you today , and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions , and we will discuss once we have finished the exam . patient: sounds good .","3555":"doctor: all right . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . all right . i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . all right , so if you could just lay back for me , and i'll examine your abdomen . patient: okay .","3556":"doctor: all right . do you have any tenderness ? patient: no , not really .","3557":"doctor: okay . so the abdomen is soft , non-tender . no masses or organomegaly . and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . all right . you can go ahead and sit up now . thank you . all right , so first i want you to try citrucel . it does come in a tablet . you should use it twice daily for regularity . then i would say , if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 milligrams . you can do one tablet before you eat , and then repeat up to four times daily . and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything . um , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later , and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine . patient: okay , that sounds good .","3558":"doctor: okay . and so your bentyl , that's the anti-spasm medication , and i would take the higher dose . patient: can i get a refill of that ?","3559":"doctor: yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse . patient: yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas .","3560":"doctor: okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water . patient: okay .","3561":"doctor: okay , and you can take it , but before you do , we want to try to reduce the triggers . uh , so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks . patient: okay , i can do that .","3562":"doctor: okay . and so , however , if it is not just these isolated inci- incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long term medication that would take ... that you would take every night . and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ? patient: i was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether .","3563":"doctor: yeah , there is . and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ? patient: that sounds like a much better plan .","3564":"doctor: okay , great . we can definitely do that . uh , just take it every night before bedtime . patient: okay , that sounds good . thank you so much .","3565":"doctor: you're welcome . and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else . and then let's plan on touching base through mychart email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms . okay ? patient: okay , that sounds good . thank you .","3566":"doctor: you're welcome , and have a good rest of your day . so review of symptoms is positive for diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal pain . assessment and plan . brittany edwards is a pleasant female with ibs and functional abdominal pain , aggravated by high stress , poor eating habits , and poor sleeping habits . i've encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications , as well as starting a neuromodulator such as elavil 25 milligrams at bedtime for ibs . she can use bentyl 20 milligrams as needed 30 to 45 minutes prior to eating out at a restaurant . she can also use zofran if needed . however , i have encouraged her to reduce greasy and fatty foods and alcohol consumption . i have asked her to follow up in one month by emailing over mychart regarding any side effects and issues , or issues with elavil or if adjustments are needed .","3567":"doctor: okay , so our next patient is christopher watson . date of birth 04\/12\/1934 . mr . watson is- is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow-up for adult hydrocephalus . this is his first visit since undergoing sh- shunt surgery , excuse me , on august 1st , 2020 . i have followed mr . watson since may of 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control . we established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spino catheter protocol in june 2020 , and he underwent shunt surgery on august 1st , 2020 . a medtronic strata programmable shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at a level 2.0 was placed . good morning , mr . watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ? patient: hi , doc . this is my daughter , theresa . she is the one who helps me keep things straight .","3568":"doctor: mr . watson , have you been sick or been hosp -- hospitalized since your shu- shunt surgery three months ago . patient: uh , not that i recall . patient_guest: no , he has n't . he has been doing much better .","3569":"doctor: good , i'm glad to hear that . before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control . are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ? patient_guest: his walking has improved . he's now able to walk to the dining room just fine . but he could not do that before surgery . he still has times where i have to help him .","3570":"doctor: that's impressive , mr . watson . patient: yeah , i guess . patient_guest: now his bladder control did improve some after surgery , but now seems to have leveled out . so he is wearing diapers .","3571":"doctor: no issues with sores from wearing the diaper ? and any decreased or painful urination ? patient_guest: no , not at all .","3572":"doctor: and how about cognition ? patient: i think i'm better . i do n't feel lost when talking to someone anymore . patient_guest: dad and i both think my sister , hannah , summarized it best . she said \" i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again , \"","3573":"doctor: that's so wonderful ! now have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ? patient: no . has n't bothered me one bit .","3574":"doctor: okay . and any pain in your belly at all ? patient: ca n't say that i have .","3575":"doctor: okay , sounds like you have been improving . alrighty , mr . watson , i'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me . is that all right ? patient: sounds good .","3576":"doctor: okay , i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month , and then we'll chat about it when i come in . all righty , mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . now , i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms , and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan . patient: so what does that mean ?","3577":"doctor: just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved so that's all good for me . so really there's , there's nothing to worry about . patient: all right so i'll come back in three months ?","3578":"doctor: yep , that's right . patient: i do have a question for you though .","3579":"doctor: yeah , of course . patient: do you think i will be able to drive again ?","3580":"doctor: ah man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range . and that , that definitely could be you . you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that then , ya know , i think it could be possible , um , and i'd be happy to recommend it . now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation . so you could kind of do that preemptively , and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go . patient: okay . i kinda figured that anyway but i just thought i'd ask . i do n't like to burden anyone when i just need to run to the store but i also know that i need to be safe .","3581":"doctor: yeah , your safety is our number one priority and , ya know , i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right , they want to keep you here and have you safe . but , i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved . and so , i'm sure when we talk again in three months , we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement . patient: i sure hope so , doc . patient_guest: we really appreciate all that you've done . do we make the appointment out front ?","3582":"doctor: yeah , that would be great . the girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now , and you both take care , all right ? patient: thanks patient_guest: thank you .","3583":"doctor: all righty , so ros is constitutional significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions . negative for fever or unintentional weight loss . gu is significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper . negative for genital sores , decreased or painful output . neurological significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment . negative for headaches , recent falls , or hallucinations . psychiatric is negative for depression , excessive worrying , or mood swings . let's go ahead and use the short pe . vitals ,

through , um , though his daughter does add some details . the shunt sight was clean , dry , and intact with a confirmed setting of two . um he was tested um for recent and remote memory , attention span , and concentration in fund of knowledge . he scored a 26 out of 30 on the mmse when tested with spelling and 25 out of 30 when tested with calculations . of note , he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing , and the third with multiple choice . this was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23 out of 30 with calculations and 24 out of 30 with spelling . and at the time he was unable um in the previous test , excuse me , he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing without and only one with multiple choice . gait testing using the tinetti assessment tool . he was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of six to eight out of 12 and a balance score of 12 out of 16 for a total score of 18 to 20 out of 28 . this is slightly improved from his initial score of 15 to 17 out of 28 . cranial nerves , pupils are equal . eoms are intact . face symmetric . no disarchria . motor normal for bulk and strength . coordination slow

blood pressure medications ? patient: yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .","3593":"doctor: and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um ,

aware of or that we should be checking ? patient: mm , no .","3595":"doctor: okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ? patient: yes . yes i am .","3596":"doctor: okay good . what

everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you . patient: yeah i agree with that .","3604":"doctor: so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges . patient: the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?","3605":"doctor: it actually will help with both . patient: okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?","3606":"doctor: generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better . patient: yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .","3607":"doctor: yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse . patient: yeah , sure , sure .","3608":"doctor: okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good . patient: i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .","3609":"doctor: okay , yeah , maybe you have . patient: yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .","3610":"doctor: okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ? patient: yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?","3611":"doctor: yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but

right that sounds good .","3613":"doctor: all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good .

murmur , no gallop , jvp flat , with a head at 90 degrees . she does not appear anxious , agitated or depressed . my impression , alcohol use disorder . she would like to start naltrexone which we have previously discussed . she will take the injectable form and start on may 17th . we reviewed side effects and risks . the potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to her for many reasons . hypertension , she is taking lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams daily . quite possibly her blood pressure will improve completely with cessation of alcohol . her target bp is 130 to 140 over 70 to 80 . i will see her back week of june 14th , which is likely around the time of her second naltrexone injection . i recommend upgrading influenza

or consistency , as usually , it is .","3621":"doctor: right . patient: um . that part did n't even phase me , until i noticed that the right side of my vagina was hurting . just sore , you know , but that has n't gone away .","3622":"doctor: yep . nah , that does sound like a cause for concern . how long have you been with him ? patient: hmm , we've been dating for three years .","3623":"doctor: mm-hmm . patient: as far as , i can figure , he started cheating on me , i think , about three months ago .","3624":"doctor: uh- . um , okay . do you ... have you ever had an irregular pap smear ? patient: well , yeah , i did , but it was back whenever i was 20 or so . it has n't ... and i have n't had one since .","3625":"doctor: okay . and when was your last pap smear ? patient: uh , about six months ago . it came back normal , though .","3626":"doctor: okay . good , okay . well , let's see ... let's take a look at you , and then , we'll get some samples for std testing . okay ? patient: all right .","3627":"doctor: you'll hear me talk through your exam , so that i can get it all documented . uh- ? use my general physical exam template . pelvic exam demonstrates no external lesions . normal labia majora and labia minora . normal physiological discharge , with normal color and smell . ms. ross , i'm going to touch you , now . you'll feel my fingers , and the speculum in your vagina . you'll feel some pressure , now . cervix is normal . vaginal wall is normal . no cervical motion tenderness and no adnexal tenderness or masses noted . swabs were done for std testing . okay , ms. ross . everything looks good from a visual standpoint . i'm going to send off std testing for , uh , gonorrhea , chlamydia , trichomoniasis , and i'll have you give some blood for syphilis , hiv and hepatitis c. some of these tests will take longer than others . we will call you , if we see anything , but if you have n't heard anything , you can call us in three days for results . patient: okay . sounds good . thank you , so much .","3628":"doctor: of course , my pleasure . and , if everything is normal , i'll see you again , at your next annual checkup . assessment : is screen for std . plan : discussed with patient , and please add that she is high risk due to an abnormal pap smear in the past , and the recent discovery of her sexual partner having multiple partners , for some period of time . end of recording .","3629":"doctor: tyler nelson , date of birth : 3 , 6 , 1949 , mrn , 385729 . he is here today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis . last time he was here , he received a steroid injection in his right knee . hello mr. nelson , how are you ? patient: um , about the same as last time . my knee is still swollen .","3630":"doctor: that was your right knee , correct ? i take it the injection did n't help ? patient: it did , maybe for a couple of weeks .","3631":"doctor: that's it ? and is it still painful ? patient: yeah , it's pretty painful , and now the whole leg is getting swollen .","3632":"doctor: okay , what would you say your pain level is ? patient: i mean , right now it's about a 3 or so , but , typically on a normal day it's around 6 .","3633":"doctor: okay , and its been swollen like that for how long now ? patient: since i was last here a couple weeks after that . so about , maybe two months now .","3634":"doctor: okay , but before it was just the knee ? patient: yeah , the whole thing was n't swollen like this , but i tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time , but it has n't been helping .","3635":"doctor: okay , okay , so that has n't been working for you ? patient: i mean , it helps to some degree , but it's still swollen , especially around the knee .","3636":"doctor: hmm . has it been keeping you from doing things during the day ? patient: well , i slowed down a little bit , and i found a few things too fast . but when it really hurts , is when i've been sitting for a while , and then i have to try and get up . i'm so stiff getting up i have to use a cane to get my bearings . i mean , after a little bit , it loosens up , but that first getting up is real difficult .","3637":"doctor: yeah , i can see , that makes sense . have you been taking your medication regularly ? your on xeljanz right ? patient: yeah , the xr , i think its , uhm , 11 milligrams a day ? yeah , but i'm taking it everyday , and i'm also taking celebrex which i started maybe 2 months ago .","3638":"doctor: yes , the 200mgs daily . how's that working for you ? patient: pretty good , up until it started swelling again .","3639":"doctor: okay , well come sit over here , and if you could take of your socks and shoes , and we'll take a look at your knee . and just to let you know , i have a service now that writes my note about the visit , so you'll hear me call things out and describe what i see fully . patient: okay , gotcha .","3640":"doctor: right , so let's check your leg . can you straighten it , and does it hurt ? patient: yeah , when i try to straighten it all the way it does .","3641":"doctor: okay , range of motion slightly diminished . i'm going to press here , okay ? and how about here , hmm , i see some pitting around the knee and ankle . normal capillary refill in the toes . does any of this area hurt ? patient: um , just kinda sore , like an old bruise ?","3642":"doctor: so , i can feel that the knee is hot , and that means there's something going on , like some inflammation . so we can give you another steroid injection for that . i also want to get an x-ray of that knee , so we can see where all the swelling is coming from . patient: yeah . let's do it . sounds go to me .","3643":"doctor: okay , and did we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ? patient: yeah , that was some years ago , but that was the other knee .","3644":"doctor: okay . so i think we'll set that up for you now . we'll also do an x-ray on that knee . i can send you for a physical therapy , and if nothing is helping , then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee . patient: okay , sounds like a plan .","3645":"doctor: all right , so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot . i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection . there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless . patient: okay . and that's a procedure you're going to do right now ?","3646":"doctor: yep . once we're done talking here , and as far as the edema in your legs , uh , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can do as well . the compression socks are a good start . um , and also , do you eat a lot of salt ? patient: i mean , um , i mean i love my salty snacks .","3647":"doctor: okay . well , salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling . you can also prop your feet up any time you get a chance , especially at night . and have you talked to your private care doctor about this at all ? patient: no , i figured i would just come here first .","3648":"doctor: okay . so i think , try some of those things out first , and if it does n't help , definitely make an appointment with them , also , as you know , xeljanz is a high-risk medication , so we need to check your cmp levels every couple of months . so this time your levels are good , but do make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time . patient: all right . i can do that . thank you so much doc .","3649":"doctor: yes , of course . well let me go ahead and get supplies and we'll get to work on your knee . fluid aspiration and steroid injection procedure . the risks , benefits , and alternatives were explained . the risks of steroid injection were explained , including , but not limited to : hypopigmentation , soft tissue atrophy , tendon ruptures , and transient hypoglycemia among others . verbal consent was attained . the right knee was , uh , um , accessed through the lateral approach with 3 milliliters of initially clear fluid , then bloo- blood tinged fluid . then the right knee was prepped in a standard-fashion . the right knee was injected with 80 milligrams of triamcinolone , and one milliliter of lidocaine . the procedure was tolerated well , with no complications . post-procedure instructions were given . patient will follow up with his pcp . thank you .","3650":"doctor: uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate . hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ? patient: i'm pretty . good . how are you ?","3651":"doctor: good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now . patient: yes . it's doing much better .","3652":"doctor: good , good . do you have any rash leftover ? patient: yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .","3653":"doctor: okay , that sounds good . patient: but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .","3654":"doctor: i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ? patient: no , i'm not right now .","3655":"doctor: okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication . patient: yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .","3656":"doctor: okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel . patient: okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .","3657":"doctor: okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . patient: okay . i did n't realize that .","3658":"doctor: yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? patient: okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?","3659":"doctor: so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ? patient: twice a day .","3660":"doctor: okay , and that's not drying you out too much ? patient: no , that's fine .","3661":"doctor: okay . and you're using the metro cream ? patient: yes .","3662":"doctor: how often are you using that one ? patient: after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .","3663":"doctor: okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ? patient: no .","3664":"doctor: so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ? patient: i'm not .","3665":"doctor: okay . and no neutrogena wipes ? patient: no wipes .","3666":"doctor: okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ? patient: i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .","3667":"doctor: no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see . patient: okay .","3668":"doctor: um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ? patient: that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .","3669":"doctor: okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone . patient: yeah .","3670":"doctor: i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline . patient: okay .","3671":"doctor: uh , but i would pickup the elidel too . patient: okay , i can do that .","3672":"doctor: i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk . patient: it is ? okay .","3673":"doctor: um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself . patient: yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .","3674":"doctor: great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that . patient: yes , i did . thank you .","3675":"doctor: all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it . patient: yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .","3676":"doctor: it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something . patient: okay .","3677":"doctor: let's see . patient: so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .","3678":"doctor: ugh , yeah . that's way too much . patient: i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .","3679":"doctor: yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate . patient: okay .","3680":"doctor: because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 . patient: yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .","3681":"doctor: okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form . patient: you mean the tacrolimus ?","3682":"doctor: yeah , mm-hmm . patient: okay .","3683":"doctor: so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else . patient: can you do the metro market ?","3684":"doctor: yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find . patient: sure .","3685":"doctor: pharmacy is what i'm trying to say . patient: okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?","3686":"doctor: correct , it's not a steroid . patient: okay , good .","3687":"doctor: it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation . patient: okay .","3688":"doctor: but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin . patient: all right .","3689":"doctor: these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad . patient: okay . got it .","3690":"doctor: so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ? patient: okay , thank you for explaining .","3691":"doctor: so i will say , \" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . \" patient: okay . so only apply to the rash area ?","3692":"doctor: yes , and keep using the face wash. patient: okay .","3693":"doctor: i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ? patient: i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .","3694":"doctor: i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you . patient: all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .","3695":"doctor: i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day . patient: that sounds good .","3696":"doctor: so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day . patient: okay .","3697":"doctor: and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping . patient: okay , sounds good .","3698":"doctor: all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here . patient: thank you so much .","3699":"doctor: if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ? patient: okay .","3700":"doctor: but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly . patient: sounds good .","3701":"doctor: all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping . patient: okay .","3702":"doctor: once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream . patient: okay , that sounds good . i can do that .","3703":"doctor: and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well . patient: all right .","3704":"doctor: i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ? patient: yeah , sounds good .","3705":"doctor: do you have enough refills ? patient: yeah , i think so .","3706":"doctor: okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one . patient: yes , i do .","3707":"doctor: all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still . patient: yes .","3708":"doctor: okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well . patient: and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?","3709":"doctor: yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks . patient: okay , thank you .","3710":"doctor: okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples . patient: okay , that sounds good .","3711":"doctor: for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .","3712":"doctor: hey good morning bobby how are you patient: i'm doing okay i as you're aware doctor miller sent me over for this pain in my belly that i've had for several weeks they did he did an ultrasound and and said i had gallstones and they recommended i stay several way from some high fat food but i'm just still having a lot of pain and he referred me to you","3713":"doctor: alright well i'm i'm sorry to hear that you're having pain but i i'm glad that he sent you over to see me i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain can you describe the kind of pain that you feel patient: well it's it's on the right hand side of my belly it's it's right underneath my ribs and it feels like a a squeezing severe pain it comes and goes but when it comes it's really severe and i get kind of nauseated and sick in my stomach","3714":"doctor: okay and then when you get that pain can you rate that pain for me on a scale like zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life patient: when it's severe it's it's probably an eight","3715":"doctor: okay alright and then time wise are we looking at can it just come and go anytime or is it specifically around mealtimes how how does that pain kinda wax and wane for you patient: most of the time it comes right after i eat","3716":"doctor: do n't weigh all so speaking of eating let's talk a little bit about your diet i see here on your chart that you're a type two diabetic and it looked like that you were gon na handle that with diet and exercise let's talk about that a little bit patient: well you know i my my diet was worse when i before i was diagnosed with the the type two diabetes","3717":"doctor: okay so other than the weight loss how how is your diet is that has that been working out for you i mean do you does does that does that fit your lifestyle pretty well patient: yeah it does it does it it i was surprised it was n't as hard as i thought to go back and cut back and go more of a keto diet","3718":"doctor: yeah and that can happen and one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods which is you know kind of the the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food and has that been difficult since you are watching your carb intake patient: the fatty food it is a little bit difficult you know i like those pork grinds and you know i i've had to kind of cut those out they were a nice staple for me when i was on the keto diet but i have cut out the those pork rinses because those were just so delicious and you know i would say it's a little bit better but i still get that pain","3719":"doctor: okay and then do you have any family history of gallbladder disease patient: yeah but you know you know i knew that was coming both my dad and my mother both had gallbladder disease and had to have their gallbladders off","3720":"doctor: okay so both both your parents your mom and your dad had your had their gallbladders taken out patient: yeah","3721":"doctor: okay and then i wan na talk a little bit about your activity level and your and and if you're exercising has this affected your ability to to get out and exercise patient: not really i mean i usually i got ta watch it around meals you know but i've never been a big exerciser right after eating anyhow but you know i'm i'm so glad springs here because it gives me that opportunity to get back out and you know i love photography i i love nature of photography and with the with the the woods going from you know that dark barron look to coming alive with that green and and butting i i love to get out and take foot photographs there","3722":"doctor: that's awesome to hear yeah i my wife and i like to go over and take nature hikes through the new park behind the rex center that just opened up have you ever been over there to do any any picture taken we've got a bunch of beautiful nature pictures that we took about a week ago patient: no i have n't been there i might have to try that out yeah","3723":"doctor: yeah it's awesome patient: i like to get down near the river that's where i i like to catch especially around spring time","3724":"doctor: that's great yeah next time you come in maybe you can bring in some of your pictures that'd be awesome to see patient: okay cool","3725":"doctor: so i'm just curious talking about your symptoms here have you had any fevers you mentioned something about nausea but have you actually vomited from those symptoms patient: there's times when the pain is really bad for a couple of days i've had some what i i would describe as low grade fevers and yes you're right i have feel nauseated but i have n't thrown up","3726":"doctor: okay so if it's okay with you i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure was one twenty eight over eighty eight respiratory rate was sixteen your pulse rate was sixty eight you were afebrile today which is a good thing and your oxygen saturation on room air was ninety nine percent taking a listen to your heart here your heart is regular of rate and rhythm no i do n't hear any ectopic beats no clicks rubs or murmurs noted listening to your lungs here they are clear and equal bilaterally to auscultation now i'm gon na go ahead and do an an abdominal exam i do note positive bowel sounds soft nondistended abdomen however you are positive for some slight guarding there to the right upper quadrant but i do n't note any rebound tenderness now i'm gon na press slightly here beneath your ribs on the right hand side now take a breath in does that hurt when i press so i i see that you're guarded there so i'm gon na say that that it did hurt when i it did hurt when i patient: absolutely that hurts so much when you push right there","3727":"doctor: okay that's that's no problem so you are positive for murphy's signs but i do n't appreciate any peritoneal signs so let's talk a little bit about your results that i reviewed before you came in today so your abdominal ultrasound shows multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder and i do appreciate some mild thickening now the common bile duct size is within normal limits at four . one millimeters now let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you okay i do believe you have some mild cholecystitis with gallstones i do n't appreciate any frank obstruction but it looks like your gallbladder is inflamed and it looks like that's happened maybe over the last few weeks since you've been having those symptoms now since you have n't had any improvement with dietary modifications i am going to make the recommendation that we do remove your gallbladder and i would like to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy now what that means is i'll make a few small incisions and insert a scope with some of those instruments that's gon na remove that gallbladder through one of those little bitty incisions now the surgery is gon na take about an hour to an hour and a half and you'll probably spend the night in the hospital because we just wan na monitor you post procedure to make sure everything is okay you're still gon na wan na avoid those high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are gon na be high in fiber now do you have any questions about what our assessment and plan is for for this patient: no no questions today","3728":"doctor: okay now the other thing patient: how soon can i how soon will i be able to get up and get moving back outside after the surgery","3729":"doctor: so the good news is since it's a laparoscopic procedure you're gon na be back on your feet pretty quick now for the first twenty four hours i'm gon na want you to take it pretty easy but after a couple of days if you feel like moving around on some solid ground you know we do n't want you hiking or anything like that but if you feel like moving around on some solid ground you can get up and walk around within a day or two and then in about a week or so i'll see you again and then we'll release you to go get back out there in nature patient: okay thank you very much","3730":"doctor: you're very welcome the other thing i wan na talk briefly about is now your not your type two diabetes i want you to follow up with your physician just to make sure that you're handling your diabetes especially the fact that you're gon na have surgery and those type of things and we will just continue to monitor your diabetes as has been outlined by your your additional either your endocrinologist or your primary care provider i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get some paperwork signed and if you do n't have any questions for me i will see you next week and we will get this gallbladder out patient: well thank you very much i'm looking forward to i i do n't want anymore of that pain so","3731":"doctor: alright that sounds good we'll see you next week then patient: okay take care","3732":"doctor: hi matthew how are you the medical assistant told me that you injured your shoulder patient: hey yeah i'm i'm hanging in there","3733":"doctor: what happened patient: yeah so well when i was younger i used to be a little bit more active with my friends with the playing pick up football and so you know me being a little bit older now i thought i'll take back up with no problem well i did i tried and all the other guys were a little bit bigger than me so i got i got tackled a couple of times and it just i kinda landed on my shoulder a little bit weird one time and so like i got back into the game i was okay but yeah ever since then the past couple of days it's just been it's been really bothering me","3734":"doctor: okay alright and so when exactly did this happen patient: yeah i'd say maybe it was probably about last weekends so i'd say about like four days ago","3735":"doctor: okay well i'm happy at age 67 you're out there playing tackle football so good good for you and was it your right shoulder or your left

same","3744":"doctor: okay and any neck problems did you injure your neck when this happened patient: no neck has been okay","3745":"doctor: okay and any other joint problems like does your elbow hurt

when this happened patient: a little bit","3750":"doctor: okay alright did you pass out patient: nope nope stayed conscious throughout","3751":"doctor: okay alright well looking at your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever your blood pressure looks quite good it's about one twenty two over seventy six your heart rate is appropriate at eighty two beats per minute and your oxygenation is ninety five percent on room air on your cervical spine exam there is no tenderness to palpation of the cervical spine there is full range of motion on head exam there does not appear to be any trauma there is no ecchymosis or bruising on the right shoulder exam on your musculoskeletal exam there is pain to palpation of the posterior shoulder at the acromioclavicular joint there is decreased abduction and adduction to about ninety degrees only there is there is a he has pain with supination and pronation of the right arm and there is a palpable radial radial artery pulse okay so what does that mean that just means that you have some you know evidence of the injury there and we'll we're gon na talk about that so i had the nurse do a shoulder x-ray on you before i came in the room and the results of your right shoulder x-ray showed that you have an acute acromioclavicular joint fracture so you just have a a a small fracture of the acromion i do n't think that it it's gon na be anything that we need to do surgery for so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your right shoulder injury for your acute acromioclavicular joint fracture i wan na go ahead and just put you in a sling for now i wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i wan na go ahead and just order a cat scan of your right shoulder just to kinda get a better look of how the joint looks and we're gon na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to strengthen your shoulder in hopes of avoiding surgery in the future how does that sound patient: yeah that that sounds great just being able to take a little bit of something for the pain would would would be really appreciated","3752":"doctor: okay do you think you need something stronger than meloxicam patient: no i'll give that a shot","3753":"doctor: okay any questions patient: when can i get back out on the field","3754":"doctor: well you ca n't play taggle football for a while you have to have this fracture healed patient: okay","3755":"doctor: and i would avoid doing it you know as we get older you know our bones get a little bit weaker so i would avoid the tackle football maybe flag football in the future okay patient: yeah yeah that sounds good","3756":"doctor: okay anything else patient: no i think that's that's been great thank you so much","3757":"doctor: okay you're welcome have a good day bye patient: thanks","3758":"doctor: hi jeremy how are you the medical assistant told me that you injured your back patient: yeah i was moving some boxes when my son was moving out of his college dorm and i really hurt my lower back","3759":"doctor: okay how long ago did that happen patient: this was about four months ago","3760":"doctor: about four months ago okay that's quite a long time and you're just seeing me now for it patient: yeah the appointments were backed up and i tried some pt at my gym but it it really did n't seem to help and i was really concerned","3761":"doctor: okay and what exactly are your symptoms are you having pain when you're just sitting there or when you're moving around for a very short period of time patient: it felt like i was gon na tapple over i like i could n't support my my upper body weight and then my right toe or the the toes on my right foot tingled a little bit but that went away after about an hour","3762":"doctor: okay are you still getting that numbing and tingling periodically in your feet or is that completely gone patient: that's completely gone it it just happened when i first felt the the tweak in my lower back i felt that sensation but i have n't since","3763":"doctor: okay and how about any difficulty or weakness in your legs patient: only if i'm carrying something heavy otherwise it seems relatively normal but i i feel the sensation so i'm a little nervous about carrying something heavy","3764":"doctor: okay and are and do you still have pain down there in your lower back patient: if i turn a certain way or if i roll over in my sleep i'll wake up from it from a like a sharp pain but then that that goes away if i if i position myself the right way","3765":"doctor: okay and what have you been taking for the pain patient: i took some tylenol i took some ibuprofen i've tried heat i've tried ice and nothing really seems to help","3766":"doctor: okay is the ibuprofen any better than the tylenol patient: a little bit but for sure a shorter period of time","3767":"doctor: okay and did you get any stomach upset from the ibuprofen patient: no i try not to take too much so i i do n't have an upset stomach from it","3768":"doctor: okay and did you go to like an urgent care centing or an emergency room have you had any imaging on this at all patient: i went to an urgent care and they wanted me to do an mri but i was a little concerned because i think we maxed out our insurance so i i did n't do it because it started to feel better but because it's been going on so long i'm i'm a little bit concerned now i i do wan na actually move forward with that","3769":"doctor: okay alright and any other symptoms any problems with like your bladder or your bowels any incontinence or you know you feel like you ca n't go to the bathroom patient: no i have n't had any of those issues","3770":"doctor: okay alright and any other any other past medical history do you that you have any patient: i had knee surgery about two years ago on my right knee","3771":"doctor: okay and what did you have done to your right knee patient: it was a total knee replacement","3772":"doctor: okay a total knee replacement in twenty eighteen is that what you said patient: no it was actually about two years ago so it's the spring of twenty twenty","3773":"doctor: okay alright alright well i wan na go ahead and just move on to a physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings patient: mm-hmm","3774":"doctor: now you have you had any fever or chills with this patient: no","3775":"doctor: okay alright alright so looking at your vital signs here in the office you know they look really good your you you do n't have any temperature your blood pressure is good it's about one seventeen over fifty six patient: mm-hmm","3776":"doctor: your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty eight and your oxygenation is fine at ninety five percent on room air so that means everything looks good patient: good","3777":"doctor: on your neck exam i i do appreciate some bony protuberance of the c5 c6 do you have any pain when i touch here patient: no","3778":"doctor: no okay on your lumbar spine exam i do appreciate do you have pain when i touch here patient: no","3779":"doctor: okay so there is no pain to palpation of the lumbar spine there is decreased flexion and extension of the lower back the patient does have a positive straight leg raise and there is some spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine on musculoskeletal exam the lower extremities strength is equal bilaterally so what does that mean jeremy that means that you have some you know maybe a some arthritis in your neck here and or maybe just a a little bit of some injury from from that from that back that back thing that you told me about patient: mm-hmm","3780":"doctor: okay but i think overall things look really good so you know i had them do an lumbar spine x-ray on you before i saw you and i looked at the results of your lumbar spine x-ray which showed no acute bony abnormality you know there was no fracture of your back or anything which is not surprising based on your history so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so i do believe it sounds like you have an acute disk herniation now this did happen a few months ago but it sounds like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having symptoms patient: mm-hmm","3781":"doctor: i do wan na go ahead and order a a lumbar spine mri to get a a a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they do n't show us any of the soft tissue so let's go ahead and order the lumbar spine mri i wan na continue with physical therapy so i'm going to refer you to a a physical therapist through our health system patient: mm-hmm","3782":"doctor: and then i also wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day patient: mm-hmm","3783":"doctor: to help with that do you have any questions about that patient: no questions","3784":"doctor: now if you do have a herniated disk we can go ahead and talk about some other treatment options maybe like an epidural steroid injection to help take down some of that inflammation patient: mm-hmm","3785":"doctor: it might make you feel better but we'll we'll deal with that when we get get there okay patient: sure","3786":"doctor: any questions patient: not at this point","3787":"doctor: okay great thank you patient: thank you","3788":"doctor: so dennis is a 57 -year-old

good","3789":"doctor: okay how long have you been feeling not too well patient: about a couple of weeks","3790":"doctor: couple of weeks tell me what's going on patient: i wake up with shortness of breath","3791":"doctor: have you noticed any are you coughing up anything any swelling in your legs or what's going on patient: yeah i've been i've been coughing up i've been coughing up blood","3792":"doctor: okay how long has that been going on for patient: probably three weeks or so","3793":"doctor: okay and are you coughing a lot of blood or just a little bit of blood patient: i shave three to four cups a day","3794":"doctor: wow that's a lot of blood okay are you throwing up any blood are you having bleeding in any place else or just when you cough patient: only when i cough","3795":"doctor: okay have you noticed any bruising or bleeding from your teeth or anything like that or from your gums or anything like that patient: no","3796":"doctor: okay any leg swelling or calf swelling or any any anything like that any recent travel history you've been on a plane or trip recently patient: i had some knee problem but there is no swelling but it hurts that's been going on for quite some time","3797":"doctor: okay so that's not near the knee problem okay and have you had any have you been to the hospital or been to the emergency room or anything like that for your coughing and coughing up blood patient: no i tried to get an appointment in the office but they were kinda booked up","3798":"doctor: alright and alright no but no fevers with this so since you're here your oxygen level looks pretty good in the clinic it's about ninety four percent on pulse your pulse oxygenation so that's good are you short of breath so when you walk or you or you exert yourself you're short of breath you said right okay and have you and how how is your blood sugar been doing since this has been going on i know you're on metformin how's your diabetes been doing patient: not so good you know it kinda going up and down i wear this dexcom","3799":"doctor: okay and patient: and morning when i get up they are around one fifty","3800":"doctor: okay alright so it's been running a little bit high i know we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time and it was about seven . seven . i think and we had talked about you know improving your diet and improving some exercise but is this blood sugar been high and low or high and normal when you're especially in the last three weeks or has it been going on for longer than that patient: i would say about a month","3801":"doctor: okay alright and how is your blood pressure been at home since you've been taking since these episodes that you've been sick are you taking norvasc patient: yes i am but i keep them on some days because my blood pressure has been running somewhat on the low side","3802":"doctor: okay alright and right now it's about a hundred and twenty over seventy what how low does it go in the more when you check it patient: well there are sometimes in the lower nineties","3803":"doctor: okay alright well let me let me examine you here in a second and we'll think about you know what we need to do especially with your coughing and your shortness of breath okay so nita i'm i'm examining you now let's pretend i did my exam i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put it into my chart okay and i'll explain what those things mean so on my exam you've got no jvd there is no swelling in your neck no carotid bruits your lung exam you've got some rails and some rhonchi on on more on the right side i do n't hear any wheezing right now there is some diminished breath sounds in the right side as well on your heart exam you've got two over successolic ejection murmur you've had that in the past that's unchanged from before the rest regular rate and rhythm otherwise your belly exam is nice and soft on your extremity exam you've got one plus nonpitting edema on both of your lower extremities on your on your ankles no calf tenderness no negative homan sign so what does all this mean so basically you've got you know you've got some sort of infection or something going on in your lungs that i can hear right now the rest of your exam is pretty much stable it's unchanged from before so let's talk about what we what we should do about this so for the for the first problem with the shortness of breath the first thing i wan na do is go ahead and get a chest x-ray for you okay you've been coughing up blood i also wan na send you to the emergency department to get some blood testing done i'm worried about a blood clot or something else going on so i wan na get a cat scan of your chest as well so i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to the emergency department i'll call them and and have you head over that way they can get a chest x-ray and a cat scan and some blood work as well and then we'll evaluate why you're having the shortness of breath and why you're coughing up this blood okay and then depending on what they find you may need you know it could be as simple as a pneumonia or it could be something a little bit more serious we may have to get you know start you know depending on what you find we will get the right treatment started any questions about that or can you drive to the emergency department from here or is that okay patient: yeah i can bike no problem i have no question","3804":"doctor: alright for the second problem for the diabetes since your blood sugar is running a little bit high once you get over this i'm blood sugars running a little bit high once we get you over this hump of the shortness of breath and get this diagnosed i'm gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c today we will probably increase your dose of metformin from five hundred twice a day to seven fifty twice a day so why do n't we do that and then why do n't we have we'+C20:C23ll have the hemoglobin a1c back and then we can once you get over this illness that you're undergoing we'll we'll we'll discuss that more i'll have you come back in about three weeks to just discuss your diabetes and what our treatment plan will be for that okay patient: okay","3805":"doctor: for the high blood pressure definitely hold off on the norvasc for right now let's figure out what's going what's causing this episode of shortness of breath i want some blood testing done and and once we have that under better control we can reassess your blood pressure so right now hold the norvasc and then we'll have you come back once everything is done okay patient: no","3806":"doctor: any other questions or anything we know if we need to talk about today patient: no i'm good","3807":"doctor: sounds good we'll get you signed out here in a second","3808":"doctor: alright scott so so i understand that you you had some right knee injury can you tell me a little bit about what happened patient: yeah i was trying to go out and play some pickup soccer games over the weekend and went to go plank kick the ball and and just felt a pop in my right knee","3809":"doctor: okay and and how long ago did that happen patient: about three days ago","3810":"doctor: three days okay and when did you notice any swelling anything like that patient: it it's swollen some some of that swelling has gone down","3811":"doctor: okay alright and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to ten one being the least pain ten being the worst pain how's how's it been ranging patient: it's somewhere between six and seven right now it's about four or five with some of the swelling going down","3812":"doctor: okay alright and did you take anything at all to relieve the pain patient: anti-inflammatories","3813":"doctor: okay alrighty and did that help patient: yeah the ibuprofen helped a little bit but i'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now","3814":"doctor: gotcha okay now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then patient: i can bend it but it hurts towards the end of the motion and i can straighten it but it does n't it feels like i have to help get it straightened","3815":"doctor: okay alright and then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all patient: i can still bear weight on it but it feels just really loose it it does n't feel normal","3816":"doctor: gotcha okay alright well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before i take a look at your knee here i'm gon na do a physical exam and in terms of your gait here i did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation so let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick i do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of ecchymosis let me just feel around here scott how does that feel does that hurt when i kinda press on that there patient: a little bit of pain there not not really bad it's it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee","3817":"doctor: yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel patient: just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end","3818":"doctor: okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam fifty milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan patient: it it does now well i need to limit my work activities i i typically sit behind a desk but it's not been very comfortable sitting here lately","3819":"doctor: yeah definitely so yeah so you you can limit the activities for sure in terms of your work activities i know if you sit too long sometimes it can be painful because you do need to move that leg a little bit so it does n't lock up so i i would like for you to you know do do some slight activities not enough to stress your legs but definitely move move them a little bit every now and then so it does n't lock up on you okay patient: okay","3820":"doctor: alright i do want you to i know you are i know you actually jog often so i want you to just slow that down for a bit no jogging for a while until we get you know results of your mri till we figure out what we what we are gon na be doing okay patient: okay","3821":"doctor: alright and how's your dog you has it been jogging with you before this incident patient: how's just how's my dog or how is my job","3822":"doctor: your your dog patient: my my my dog is okay","3823":"doctor: very good alright well i'm gon na go ahead and have the nurse take you to the scheduler to get your mri and i'll get back with you as soon as we get the results of that patient: okay sounds good thank you","3824":"doctor: thank you","3825":"doctor: alright teresa i see here in your chart that you seem to be experiencing some elbow pain could you tell me where it hurts patient: yeah so it's hurting on the inside of my elbow","3826":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: and when i i i've been doing some pottery i've been creating you know i have a pottery wheel and i've been i love my pottery and for my son's birthday i've been making a a ceramic bowl and i'm gon na paint it and i have to do some real full decorations but i've really been working on it a lot and my gosh this is hurting and i ca n't work on it right now because it's hurting so much","3827":"doctor: i am so sorry so i mean that's really cool that you do parttery it's something that i've wanted to pick up you know but i do n't know that i have those skills yet does the pain radiate down your arm or up your shoulder or anything patient: yeah it does down my arm and along that inside of my arm","3828":"doctor: okay so the medial aspect okay have you did you hit it on anything patient: no not that i recall","3829":"doctor: okay and have you ever injured your elbow before patient: no i have n't","3830":"doctor: okay alright so on a on a scale of one to ten with ten being your arm is actively being sought off by a chainsaw how bad is the pain patient: well i'd say it's about a seven","3831":"doctor: wow that's pretty bad does it keep you up at night patient: yes it really does it's you know if i roll over and it it it just wakes me up","3832":"doctor: okay have you done anything to relieve the pain patient: well i have been taking some ibuprofen but that is n't really helping","3833":"doctor: okay and have you tried anything like ice or heat or anything else patient: i tried a little bit of ice at first","3834":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: but and it's just it's been hurting for about four days now","3835":"doctor: okay okay so it's probably it do you think it's getting worse patient: well it's just not getting better","3836":"doctor: okay no i understand okay so i know that you also have like a history of hypertension and that we have you on ten milligrams of lisinopril have you been checking your blood pressures regularly patient: yeah you know what i remember too i mean they they have been pretty good one teens to one thirties","3837":"doctor: okay alright and okay do you think that you've been good about taking your medications do you usually take them everyday patient: yeah pretty much i i i you know set an alarm for that lisinopril","3838":"doctor: awesome that's great alright and so i see that you also we are treating you for diabetes as well and that we have you on five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day how about that have you been taking that regularly patient: well sometimes i forget i mean having a medication twice a day you know sometimes i'm out doing stuff and i just forget to take it","3839":"doctor: okay alright so when you say a sweet tooth what are we talking about there patient: i love to bak also besides my ceramics i'm really big and baking and i like to make cakes and and take them to you know parties and get togethers you know family get togethers and i like to make senna rules too i've been doing that since i was very young so i kinda noticed that","3840":"doctor: okay cinnamon rolls can be kind of hard like do you for your cakes do you do you use fondant you know to like do any of the decorations patient: no i i mine are just pretty basic they're not overly fancy","3841":"doctor: so you know it's good patient: yeah","3842":"doctor: alright well so i totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family but we maybe wan na start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves is do you think that's something we could manage patient: yeah i know i need to get better on it i probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what i should and should n't eat how like if i need to combine a protein you know if i do eat something a little bit sweet maybe pling a protein or something with it","3843":"doctor: mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a patient: had some friends tell me something about that","3844":"doctor: yeah that sounds like a great idea and i think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice you know i do n't wan na as much as it's really helpful to have friends i do wan na be able to give you like a source of truth right patient: yeah i i had a diabetic consult a long time ago but yeah it it would be nice to see a dietitian again and go over those and maybe there is some new stuff too","3845":"doctor: a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay patient: yeah and can i ask you what word what were my vital signs can you show me what my vital signs were","3846":"doctor: yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far patient: no that sounds good yeah i was just curious","3847":"doctor: mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on patient: well i do go for some walks in the evening i try to get one in on the morning too","3848":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: so not a whole lot other than that because i'm busy with my pottery or baking so but i do try to get out and walk daily","3849":"doctor: okay that's awesome so like how about about how long are your walks patient: well i just walk around the neighborhood there is you know the sidewalks and there is kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge and so it's probably you know maybe one to two miles a day","3850":"doctor: wow that's intense i was not expecting that number that's awesome okay alright so maybe this five pounds is muscle we're gon na go for it okay but thank you but that's some really important information but i'm gon na start your physical exam now okay patient: okay","3851":"doctor: alright so i know that you said that you are experiencing elbow pain could you tell me is it your left or your right elbow patient: it's my right","3852":"doctor: okay alright right elbow when i touch it does it hurt on the inside patient: yes it does","3853":"doctor: okay so moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle when you turn like when you turn your wrist is if you're trying to open a door knob do you experience pain patient: no not really","3854":"doctor: alright so turning out no pain but when you turn your wrist inwards do you have any pain patient: yeah","3855":"doctor: okay so pain with resisted pronation of right forearm when you rest your arm on a table with the palm side up alright i want you to raise your hand by bending the wrist do you experiencing any pain patient: yeah that hurts","3856":"doctor: alright alright so when you are when i'm pressing here and like flexing your wrist are you experiencing any pain patient: yes","3857":"doctor: alright pain with flexion and when bending the wrist alright when i listen to you you know i'm just gon na check your heart and lungs everything sounds sounds good no murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear bilaterally to bilaterally to auscultation i'm not noticing any rash for your at your elbow i do n't notice any bruising any swelling we do wan na note that tenderness but otherwise there is no discoloration no lesions so that's good your pulses and are equal bilaterally and i think i think we have an idea of what we are dealing with here okay so i'm gon na go ahead and give you my impression and plan for your your first problem like your primary problem that you are here for is right elbow pain it's consistent with medial epicondylitis and that it just means it's pain caused from overuse and damage to the tendons in your arm what we are gon na do is rest it i'm gon na order a sling for your right arm and you can wear this while you're awake well i want you to apply ice to your elbow for twenty minutes three times a day i'm going to i'm gon na ask you to take six hundred milligrams of ibuprofen that's three pills every six hours with food and you can take that for one week i know it's really important that you said that you have something that a gift that you wan na make for your son but we're gon na hold off on pottery for the next couple of weeks just to give your arm a chance to heal you know like it's awesome that you wan na be able to do these things for your family but sometimes you know your body is not where your where your where your heart is like where your heart and your head are right and then so patient: i'll i'll just let him know that that i maybe i'll take a picture of what i have so far","3858":"doctor: absolutely that's awesome and so it'll be like a a movie like coming soon to a shelf near you that's great for your second problem right we have this longstanding diabetes i want to increase your metformin to a thousand milligrams twice a day i know that you're saying you're having a hard time keeping up with that so i want you to do a good job of like checking and recording your blood sugars every day i do need you to follow up with me in a couple weeks i also wan na order something called an a1c since you are having a hard time with like the blood like the blood sugars everyday an a1c will give me a more accurate picture of like a longer period of time and then we might need to evaluate like what are what other options that we have if your sugars if we ca n't get them a bit more under control i do want you to follow up with me in a couple of weeks about the about your diabetes and for your third problem of hypertension we're just gon na continue you on your lisinopril at ten milligrams that's it seems to be doing it's job i'm really i'm really glad about that and it's probably due to the walking that you're doing i forgot to mention for your diabetes we are gon na i'm gon na recommend a a referral to diabetic counseling that way you can get like a bit more information on like the steps that you can take to help you with that patient: i was gon na ask you how about my x-ray the x-ray of my elbow how did that look","3859":"doctor: your x-ray honestly looks great in that i do n't see any kind of fracture or bony abnormality so that's what makes me think that this is like a tendon related thing right so in reviewing your x-ray like it it does support the the the assessment and plan that i have given you i patient: okay","3860":"doctor: yeah absolutely i do think for your your primary problem the elbow that we might wan na get put you in some physical rehab if the problem is taking a little longer to heal but we'll discuss that at your next visit here okay patient: okay","3861":"doctor: alright no problem any other questions patient: nope","3862":"doctor: alright thank you for keeping me accountable","3863":"doctor: good morning noah tell me a little bit about why you are here today patient: hi document i'm i'm just had you know the back pain you know and i've i've had it for you know about a week and","3864":"doctor: okay can you tell me a little bit more about it how did it start or how did it do you remember injuring yourself patient: no not really i mean i was just like you know i guess i one day i mean i just twisted you know on my left and maybe i mean i might have picked something up","3865":"doctor: okay and is it anywhere in specific is it in the middle of the back across the whole low back or on one side or the other patient: i think it's more towards you know right in the middle maybe on the lower side and nothing on the you know i mean it sometimes it goes back you know maybe having troubles with the left eye i suppose but i mean it's aggravated you know when i you know when i do some you know maybe i'm a sudden movement to the left","3866":"doctor: okay and that's when you get the pain more patient: maybe located in the center but it goes across to the little back and i on the left side","3867":"doctor: i also heard you say you know if you twist suddenly that makes it worse is that correct patient: it makes it worse it makes it worse i mean yeah","3868":"doctor: now you know i was looking at your records and i know you have that history of diabetes and i have n't seen you a while for a follow-up for that how you've been feeling patient: i mean been okay i mean i take my meds","3869":"doctor: okay so you're on patient: mm-hmm","3870":"doctor: yeah i think i think you're on that metformin twice a day patient: yeah","3871":"doctor: yeah okay patient: yes","3872":"doctor: do you test your blood sugar at home in the mornings patient: yeah i mean i try to","3873":"doctor: and how have those numbers been patient: they bumped towards i mean bit towards the higher side i mean i must have been","3874":"doctor: well if patient: yeah","3875":"doctor: yeah if i remember right your family do n't they own that that bakery down on the corner of main street and did n't they own that patient: yeah thank you","3876":"doctor: and how do you do you stay away from those i i got ta be honest i love i love the cakes and donuts they make those are delicious patient: yeah i try to","3877":"doctor: well let me so we're gon na have to watch that and i'll come back and we'll talk a little bit about the diabetes but let's go ahead and do that i do n't wan na do a a a quick physical exam on you i'm gon na look in your eyes here and so let me quickly look in your ears patient: i see","3878":"doctor: okay that looks good and any let me let me listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and your heart it's a regular rate and rhythm that's all good as we go through that now i want you to sit up here i'm gon na press down your back starting at the top and any pain up top no patient: no","3879":"doctor: okay and then once i get down here and around that low back i wan na press in the center first does that cause you a lot of pain patient: yeah","3880":"doctor: yeah okay patient: yeah that that's the spot","3881":"doctor: okay and if i come over here to the right no patient: not that much you know","3882":"doctor: okay so and then on the left hand side if i push down here kind of into your butt patient: yeah","3883":"doctor: yeah okay patient: yeah","3884":"doctor: lay back on the stretcher for me for a second i'm gon na go ahead and and lift your legs for me or i'm gon na go ahead and lift your legs for you just relax i'm gon na start here on the right side when i lift that right leg up does that cause you significant pain or any pain at all patient: a little a little bit","3885":"doctor: okay let me come around let me lift up the left side if i lift that up does that cause patient: yeah yeah yeah that's that's","3886":"doctor: i can see that gritts on your face so okay that's good and you know as i look at your lower extremities there is no pain or numbness or tingling in your feet or anything like that patient: hmmm no","3887":"doctor: okay okay so lem me talk a little bit about my impression and plan so for that low back pain i believe you have a musculoskeletal low back strain i'm going to order a low back x-ray so we'll order that and get that done as an outpatient i do n't expect to see anything significant but it's gon na tell me how those joint spaces look and if you know if we're dealing with any disk issue but that will be the start of it and i'm also gon na order some physical therapy two for two reasons to help with a little bit with the pain but also strengthen some of the muscles there in the back so those are the two things that we are gon na do now i want you to take take four hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that occasionally with some tylenol when the pain gets more severe up to about three times a day i'm gon na also give you a prescription for some flexeril that's a muscle relaxant and i want you to take one of those once a day every evening but be careful if you're doing any strenuous or hazardous activities such as driving after you take those now for your diabetes my impression is that your diabetes is is under control i noticed that we do n't have n't had a a1c for almost five months so i'm also gon na order an a1c so we can find out where we are with that continue with your diet and exercise we know that's really important and then continue with your metformin i'm not gon na make any changes today but we'll go ahead and look at that once i get that results of that a1c do you have any questions for me patient: yeah can i still go to the bakery","3888":"doctor: i would yes it's nice for you to go to the bakery but you ca n't have any donuts i'm no i you just really need to watch that intake of of anything that you might get at the at the bakery so just just be careful with those carbohydrates those sweets that you're taking as we go through your day it's occasional occasional one perfectly fine but on a routine basis we need to watch that patient: right and how soon should i you know check my blood sugars i mean what's a good you know","3889":"doctor: yeah i that's a great question i'm really glad you asked that i would prefer that you're taking your blood pressure every morning the first thing you get up when you get up in the morning that's gon na give me a good idea and so if you can do that the first thing in the morning and keep a record of it you know i know your glucometer keeps a record of it but if you can write them down and once we get that a1c that's gon na give me a little more guidance on how to deal with your blood your diabetes patient: right do you think would i need to see you know a pain doctor or you know","3890":"doctor: not yet let's let's get the that's a great question i may end up referring you to a a pain doctor for that low back pain but i really would like to start with some of the diagnostics first let's get an x-ray and if there is you know any question of that x-ray and the pain continues i'm gon na go ahead and maybe order a cat scan and then at that point in time we can refer you to a pain doctor if we're still having significant pain patient: sounds good","3891":"doctor: okay thank you i'm gon na send my nursing to see you and we'll get you out the door patient: thank you","3892":"doctor: take care patient: that one is a follow-up mm-hmm","3893":"doctor: hi gregory how are you i the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee patient: yeah yeah i heard it stepping off a curb","3894":"doctor: how long ago did that happen patient: about two and a half weeks ago","3895":"doctor: two and a half weeks ago and what what knee is bothering you patient: the right knee the outside of my right knee","3896":"doctor: the outside of your right knee patient: yeah","3897":"doctor: okay and did you actually fall down when this happened or patient: no i just sorta turned over my ankle","3898":"doctor: and no okay so now it clicks when you walk okay does it hurt when you walk patient: no unless i stand on one foot for an extended period of time like leaning my foot up against the wall","3899":"doctor: okay and what have you taken for the pain patient: really nothing","3900":"doctor: does the ibuprofen work patient: at night you know during the day i'm more active so it it really does n't impact it because i just work through it but at night it does help me to settle down and sleep better","3901":"doctor: does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there patient: no when it's up it's fine when it's down on the floor with my foot flat it's fine it does hurt when i rest it on my heel","3902":"doctor: okay and are you able to do things like bending or things like that patient: a full squat that's when i feel the most clicking like if i go all the way down to a full squat like a catcher that's when i feel the most clicking but otherwise no there is no pain it's just the clicking and i'm fearful that that's an injury of some type","3903":"doctor: okay alright now you said squats are you are you active are you doing like burpees going to patient: no i ride the bike","3904":"doctor: okay alright well i have a peloton who is your favorite instructor patient: i i actually do n't have a favorite instructor i have more favorite rides","3905":"doctor: okay what kind of rides do you like patient: i like rock music and regain music rides so whoever is doing those in a began or a medium content i'm cool with","3906":"doctor: i ca n't picture you as a regade person so that's interesting to know okay alright and any numbing or tingling in your foot at all patient: yes but not from the knee injury i broke my foot my second toe on my right foot and i have numbness depending upon the shoe i wear","3907":"doctor: okay when did you break your toe patient: i've broken it three times over the last ten years so it's just something that's a an annoyance but it was n't caused by this injury","3908":"doctor: okay so you do have some numbing and tingling but it's not new patient: right correct","3909":"doctor: alright alright well let's just go ahead and i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out my exam findings i'll let you know what that means so on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some slight edema you do have a slight effusion does it hurt when i press on the outside of your knee patient: no not physically","3910":"doctor: okay there is no pain to palpation of the right lateral knee i'm gon na be bending your knee in all sorts of positions does that hurt patient: only when you pull it to the outside","3911":"doctor: okay the patient has a positive varus test there is full range of motion there is a negative lachman sign the patient does on cardiovascular exam the patient does have a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse okay well let's just i wan na talk a little bit about i had the nurse do an x-ray on you and i looked at the results of your knee x-ray and it does n't show any acute fracture or bony abnormality which is not surprising based on your injury so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so i think you do have a a lateral a lateral collateral ligament strain based on your exam findings and this this type of injury essentially can be healed by itself you know i do n't think we're gon na need to refer you to surgery or anything like that i want you to go ahead and i'm gon na prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i do wan na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those muscles and areas around that injury then that will make your knee stronger it help prevent future injuries are you able to ice it at all during the day now you said you working you work in sales so you said you're home patient: yeah i actually i'm at home so i can ice it and i have been icing it","3912":"doctor: okay and so does that help at all patient: it's it it makes it feel better in the morning when i first go to my desk and at the end of the day before bed you know i take ibuprofen so i do n't have swelling overnight but honestly i have a pretty decent threshold for pain so it's not good it's not changing it by much","3913":"doctor: okay do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or better patient: i think i think pretty much for the last two weeks they've remained about the same the the only time i feel like they get worse is when i exert myself doing up and down like gardening in the yard or moving pots and stuff outside that's the only time i felt like it got any worse but nothing to the point where it stayed worse","3914":"doctor: okay alright well let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy if you're still having pain then we might have to consider an mri patient: okay","3915":"doctor: any questions about that patient: no","3916":"doctor: okay alright well it was very nice seeing you today call me if you need anything patient: i will","3917":"doctor: okay bye patient: bye","3918":"doctor: hi dennis how are you today patient: good","3919":"doctor: so what what brings you into the office i do n't believe i have ever seen you before here patient: the i'm training for a triathlon and the back of my heel hurts typically after a workout or when i first get up in the morning it will really hurt in the back of my heel all the way up into my calf","3920":"doctor: okay now tell me a little bit about this triathlon training what do you are you are you running far are you tell me kind of how you work out for that today patient: i i will run about ten klometers","3921":"doctor: wow that's that's a that's an aggressive campaign to get there so really hope you get that triathlon in so you're how many days a week does this occur that you're training patient: i i do that five days a week on the weekends i kinda alternate between you know a long run and a long bike do n't really do a long swim but","3922":"doctor: okay on your running days or when you do the running tell me a little bit about your stretching routine do you are you aggressive stretchers you do not stretch at all i know people that do both patient: yeah i do n't i do n't stretch at all i do n't have time for that","3923":"doctor: okay and i'm assuming that with the bicycle either you do n't really work the lower legs to get them stretched out you just jump on and go correct patient: yeah","3924":"doctor: okay tell me a little bit about the pain is you said it it's after the activity but it you when you first wake up in the morning it it's it's there also patient: yeah when i first get out of bed it's just it just feels really tight and almost like it's tearing and i after i been walking around for about ten or fifteen minutes it eases up a little bit but if if i ever sit down for any extended period of time and then try to get back up it's really sore again","3925":"doctor: no go ahead go ahead patient: or after a lot of activity it'll get sore too","3926":"doctor: okay okay i'm sure this is impacting that ability to to really focus on your training uh as you're going with that with that type of a pain so lem me go ahead and let's let's take a look at your your and your lower extremities here and yeah okay so roll up your pants yeah okay good now does your left leg hurt at all do you get that severe pain or is it mainly on the right patient: no it's mainly just on the right","3927":"doctor: okay okay so i'm gon na just hold your leg here and i want you to take your your foot and ankle and i want you to go ahead and just pull your your toes up towards you does that create some pain when you do that patient: yeah a little bit","3928":"doctor: a little bit okay now i'm just gon na hold your foot up and i want you to push against me and does that hurt patient: yeah that hurts a little bit too","3929":"doctor: yeah okay okay roll over here on my my stretcher for me and i want you to dangle your your feet over the edge and what i wan na do is i just wan na i'm gon na squeeze your left calf first and when i do that does that hurt on your left side patient: no","3930":"doctor: and i'm gon na squeeze on the right side anything there patient: no","3931":"doctor: okay okay well that's good your your thompson test is negative that's a really good finding and i just wan na continue pressing here on your right from your heel when i squeeze your heel does that cause significant pain at all patient: yeah","3932":"doctor: yeah okay and if i come up a little bit further as i i run up that achilles tendon does that hurt patient: that's real tender","3933":"doctor: yeah okay okay great not great so yeah go ahead and sit up for me so dennis my diagnosis is achilles tendinitis and it's really from overuse when we see this frequently when somebody starts to you know get in and train aggressively for an event i'm unfortunately i'm gon na have to ask you to stop training for a a week or two i know that's concerning but i really want this to heal before we move into that next phase i did n't ask you about medication but i'm assuming whatever you were doing was n't working significantly so what i'd like you to do is take some ibuprofen or advil that's the same medication and i want you to take three tablets every six hours and that's really an anti-inflammatory see if we can eliminate some of that tendinitis type pain that you're getting that inflammation around that achilles tendon i'm gon na also order a couple physical therapy visits and the reason for that is i'd like you to get some strength and stretching understanding i think it's important for you especially here at the beginning is to get some of that real stretching knowledge in and learn how to stretch those muscles before you start these activities and they are gon na help strengthen your your lower extremities also and i want you to come back to me within you know a week to ten days following your first couple physical therapy appointments so i can monitor how you're doing i see no reason for an x-ray at this point but if this continues we're gon na you know if you're still having pain ten days in significant pain without change modification of your activity then we may have to look at more aggressive treatment plans how does that sound for you patient: sounds good","3934":"doctor: okay hey did you happen to catch that pittsburgh pang one hockey game last night patient: no i i was watching the track meet","3935":"doctor: my gosh the the pang ones are on fire you know they beat up on new york seven to two i mean the hockey's just an amazing sport i i just do you guy do you do a lot of hockey down there in town here patient: used to when i lived in detroit","3936":"doctor: no yeah detroit is a hockey town yeah the red wings okay well i'm gon na go ahead and i'll send my nurse in and go ahead and get you discharged and like i said i'd like to see you back here in seven to ten days after that first physical therapy appointment i've got a great phenomenal office staff you just call in once that gets scheduled they will get you in to that next available appointment so take care and i will talk to you later patient: thanks","3937":"doctor: so hey christina good to see you today i see you're here you have a nonhealing foot ulcer well also looks like in my notes that you got some you've got type two diabetes and that probably the reason for your ear but ulcer not healing so how you doing today what's going on patient: doing pretty good except i ca n't get this ulcer to heal","3938":"doctor: okay how long has that wound been present patient: maybe about a year","3939":"doctor: a year well that that's a that's a a long time so when it started i guess did you have any trauma to the foot or did was it just all of a sudden patient: no trauma it just it seemed like a little blister and then i picked at it and it did get a little bit red and infected so i talked to my primary about it","3940":"doctor: okay when was the last time you were on antibiotics patient: it's probably been five months","3941":"doctor: five months alright do you remember which antibiotics you were on patient: keflex","3942":"doctor: keflex alright so kinda does your foot hurt or is it just just the patient: no pain but i do n't have much feeling in my foot","3943":"doctor: alright so you've got neuropathy yeah that that that makes sense with the the diabetes so have you had any other symptoms like a fever chills any drainage coming from it patient: lately there has been a lot more drainage and i just feel a little more tired","3944":"doctor: okay alright well that that sounds good so today is thursday so what do you have for the weekend patient: not too much i'll probably be walking around at the zoo on this ulcer all weekend and eating out and not doing anything my doctor wants me to do","3945":"doctor: no yeah i yeah i know you do have that diabetes i know your pcp probably would n't be excited about you you eating out and all that but you know hopefully we can we i can at least get your your foot a little bit better so your diabetes i know we talked a little bit earlier how is that going for you is it controlled you know what's your your blood sugars running patient: yeah they are running better than they were but they are still in the two hundreds so my doctor does n't like that my last a1c was about ten","3946":"doctor: okay alright yeah i i you probably definitely need to get back with your pcp about that because the a1c is is pretty high and i know he probably had you on some medication and insulin and metformin and insulin just to try to to get that lower but patient: yes","3947":"doctor: you know we are here for your foot so let's let me take a look at that so we will do a quick exam of your foot so you do n't have any fever your vitals look good so on your your right foot exam i can see here you do have a one by two centimeter two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint i do see some yellow slough that's present with minimal granulation tissue you have no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there is n't any evidence of fluid collection i do n't see necrosis so there is no dead tissue around it there's no odor and i i do n't appreciate any bony exposure and does it hurt when i touch it here patient: no","3948":"doctor: okay so we did a x-ray of your right foot before you came in and it showed no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that there is no bone infection which is really good so let me just talk a little about my assessment and plan of your your foot so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer so what i'm gon na do is i'm going to order a abi or ankle brachial index and that's just to determine your blood supply just to see if we can actually heal that wound i know it's been there for about a year which is a pretty long time and so we just need to see if we can if you do have that blood flow just in case we need to to make other goals for that foot just to depend upon that i'm also gon na do a debridement here have you had that done before of the patient: yes i think so","3949":"doctor: okay so you know you know pretty much about that so i'm just gon na try to take off some of that dead tissue we'll do that here in the office afterwards and then i'm going to prescribe you some colaganase ointment and you could just add that to your wound once a day and cover it with a sterile dressing and we're gon na try to continue that until we see it start to shrink and hopefully you know that will work between the debridement and then the ointment did they give you at your pcp they give you a surgical shoe or have you been wearing your regular shoes patient: i've just been wearing my regular shoes","3950":"doctor: okay so we're gon na get you a surgical shoe and i want you to to wear that and that can help you take pressure off the area because i know you said you're gon na walk around with this zoo this this weekend so i definitely do n't want you to put much pressure on it from now on and hopefully that can help it heal and so after all that i'm just gon na see you back in two weeks and we could take another look and possible do another debridement of the ulcer so do you have any questions for me patient: i do n't think so","3951":"doctor: alright so i'll see you back in two weeks and i hope you have fun at the zoo this weekend patient: thank you","3952":"doctor: alright thanks","3953":"doctor: alright julia so you've been coming to see me for a while now ever since you had an rca stent placed back in twenty eighteen but i see you're here for follow-up after an interior stemi where we had to put in another stent right so like how are you doing patient: well i mean it was a real shock for me i thought everything was fine after my last heart attack and then i just started having this horrible chest pain and it would n't go away so i went to the emergency room and yeah they told me i needed another stent","3954":"doctor: wow so you were experiencing similar symptoms similar to what you had the first time patient: yeah yeah it was yeah it was bad it was just like the last time","3955":"doctor: okay have you had any chest pain or shortness of breath patient: no i think i saw you about six months ago and and i was doing fine","3956":"doctor: okay have you been able to like exercise at all since since you last saw me patient: yeah you know i walk my dog everyday and you know we go like a mile and a half or two miles","3957":"doctor: awesome okay yeah you know because like fall is setting in like are you excited patient: yeah yeah i'm excited","3958":"doctor: do you have any like plans for the holiday patient: no mm-hmm no i'm just you know looking forward to seeing family and having some nice weather and yeah","3959":"doctor: okay so i do wan na ask i know that you have a history of coronary artery disease hypertension and diabetes so i wan na get an idea of like where you stand with those have you been experiencing any kind of leg swelling patient: i have noticed that my legs are a little swollen since they sent me home from the hospital","3960":"doctor: okay are you able to lie flat at night when you sleep patient: yeah i mean i always use a couple of pillows you know i maybe i've had to sit up a little bit more but i mean for the most part i think it's pretty normal","3961":"doctor: okay and then have you been able to afford your medications and are you taking them like your like you were prescribed patient: yeah i'm able to afford afford them i have good insurance i am taking them they told me it's really important to take them so so yeah","3962":"doctor: yeah that's very accurate you know like there are huge consequences to not taking them so if you are noticing any problems please please please please let us know how about your diet are you watching your salt intake patient: i mean i'm not i i i have n't really adjusted i mean i tried to watch it after the last heart attack and now you know i i've kind of been less strict with my diet but i'll have to go back to watching the salt intake","3963":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: i love pizza it's my favorite food","3964":"doctor: what are you for her toppings on pizza patient: pepperoni occasionally vegetables","3965":"doctor: mm-hmm alright but you know that pepperoni is pretty high in salt on top of a cheesy pizza right patient: i know i know i'm gon na work on it","3966":"doctor: okay so we are we are gon na have to negotiate some of these diet things and then especially since you have diabetes like have you been managing that well patient: my i've been watching my sugars yep because i do n't wan na go on insulin so i'm taking that metformin that's why i've been walking my dog i'm trying to stay active","3967":"doctor: okay okay so you know maybe this is just a situation of like where we are on the right path but probably need to step up a few things okay patient: okay","3968":"doctor: alright so i do want to do a quick physical exam so you are aware i'm going to be calling out my findings as i run through it alright patient: okay","3969":"doctor: alright so your vital signs look good you know so i'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention so and then on top of that i'm not i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits so i'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam though there is a three over six systolic ejection murmur heard at the that i'm hearing at the left base that's not like a huge deal especially considering like what you've been through already in terms of the hospital but it is something that i wan na know in your chart when i listen to you your lungs your lungs are clear over here with your extremities i do notice you know some lower lower edema swelling sorry some lower swelling edema lower limb edema and it it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery the cath site is clean dry and intact without hematoma and i also your right radial artery pulses are palpable so i did review the results of your ekg and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good r wave progression and a a evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a stemi one of the reasons though that we had you come in is that we noticed on your echo there is a reduced ejection fraction of thirty five percent we are a little bit concerned about that so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary and like first diagnosis is gon na be coronary artery disease right you already have a history of that but you know we're gon na do some things to make we're gon na continue to evaluate that over time i want you to continue your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and your brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily i wan na continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor and you're gon na be taking that eighty milligrams a day and we're gon na continue you on your toprol and that's gon na be fifty milligrams daily i am gon na refer you to cardiac rehab so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to get back to exercising regularly i know it was kinda scary to have such an episode but i promise like most of the patients i have love cardiac rehab and i think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis we have newly you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation what i think is like what that means is that you're you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit concerning but i think like given your history that it will improve over time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly so i think that the muscle is just kinda like stunned like surprised and since you're compliant with your meds i think you will recover we are gon na continue you on your lisinopril twenty milligrams daily however considering that you are retaining fluid i think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure i'm gon na prescribe something called a diuretic it's called lasix and i do want to we need to take that forty milligrams once a day i wan na add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and i need you to get labs finally we will repeat another echo in about two months last but not least there is the hypertension your blood pressure seems fine i think with the aldactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider like what other diet options might be available to you maybe suggestions of things that you have n't thought about like cutting out meat especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni but maybe finding you some alternatives how does that sound patient: that sounds good yeah so i'm yeah as long as you tell me i'm gon na get better i believe you","3970":"doctor: yes yeah i i strongly believe this is our best course of action and that you will get better given enough time i i see that you are making efforts i'm really glad that you are out there walking and that you're cognizant of your diet and willing to make changes we will just you know monitor it over time okay patient: okay","3971":"doctor: alright thank you","3972":"doctor: hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on patient: i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay","3973":"doctor: yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta patient: yes and and fish oil","3974":"doctor: and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that patient: i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy","3975":"doctor: you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so patient: okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents","3976":"doctor: so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging patient: okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then","3977":"doctor: no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time patient: okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack","3978":"doctor: okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies patient: it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty","3979":"doctor: okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking patient: i thought it was close to sixty","3980":"doctor: okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet patient: yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results","3981":"doctor: i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist patient: oh","3982":"doctor: that's your kidney doctor patient: i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago","3983":"doctor: okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil patient: right yeah that's i threw all of those out","3984":"doctor: okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span patient: i'm a more of a san francisco fan","3985":"doctor: so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again patient: okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches","3986":"doctor: you can take tylenol patient: okay","3987":"doctor: yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur on your heart which i've heard before in the past and it does n't it does n't look like you're retaining any fluid which is good but you do have a little puffiness in your legs which sometimes some of the medications can cause patient: yeah i do have that","3988":"doctor: so let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and and plan for you going forward so for your first problem of your coronary artery disease i think you're doing really well i wan na go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in in exercising again okay and i am gon na go ahead and refill your metoprolol your crestor forty milligrams once a day as well as the aspirin okay i do n't think we need to proceed with a a stress test or anything at this time but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay patient: okay","3989":"doctor: okay for your patient: sounds really good","3990":"doctor: good for your second problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i am gon na reach out to doctor miller and make an appointment for you to be seen just because again i think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay patient: okay","3991":"doctor: and then for your third problem of your diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c and i'm gon na put that referral in for the dietitian to give you some dietary education and i'm gon na go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your your insulin regimen okay patient: okay","3992":"doctor: any questions patient: yeah you know i've been kinda down ever since i had my heart attack is there any medication that i could take to make me feel a little bit less sad","3993":"doctor: yeah i mean are you having any thoughts of of harming yourself or harming others patient: no no i just feel kinda down","3994":"doctor: you feel kinda down what's your patient: life sucks","3995":"doctor: what well i do n't think so what what's your support system like patient: you know i i live with my dog and that's it so it's kind of you know lonely","3996":"doctor: okay alright well would you be interested in in like a referral to psychiatry or something like that so that you have someone to talk to about some of of issues because medication can help but i do i think it's important to have you know talk some of these things out patient: okay yeah you know i'll give that a try i mean i'm retiring i got plenty of time","3997":"doctor: okay so why do n't we go ahead and i'm gon na place a referral to psychiatry for you know you know difficulty adjusting after having a heart attack maybe some some mild depression okay does that sound okay okay patient: yeah that sounds really good thank you","3998":"doctor: okay you're welcome anything else patient: so you will do the medication refill do i so that's automatic","3999":"doctor: yep i'm gon na put them into the computer and and whatever pharmacy you want yep mm-hmm patient: okay alright sounds great thank you","4000":"doctor: okay you're welcome i'll be in touch bye patient: okay alright bye-bye","4001":"doctor: yeah so sorry so barbara is a 31 -year-old female and she has history of diabetes type two and asthma and she is here today with abdominal pain so barbara tell me a little more about your abdominal pain what's been going on patient: so i've been having this pain for the past one week and as you know i have a longstanding history of diabetes and i guess i've been drinking too much coffee lately i do n't know if that triggered my gastritis so","4002":"doctor: okay alright and so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what patient: it's gradually increasing for sure","4003":"doctor: okay alright and along with the pain have you had any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea patient: nausea and vomiting is on and off","4004":"doctor: okay okay and and so and you vomited how many times patient: a couple of times","4005":"doctor: okay alright been drinking a lot of coffee you said too uh is that is that starbucks i love those nitrocolbrus and starbucks we ever had those those are incredible patient: yeah","4006":"doctor: that's patient: and the venti","4007":"doctor: yeah the for sure you got ta go venti on that you really have to coax them into it though they wo n't even give you it's it's like you need a license to get a venti on that that nitro it's so strong so that's my achilles heel i tell you but okay so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain uh you you you you've been drinking more coffee and maybe that's related as you're thinking patient: yeah i think so because i started last week and towards the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad so i've been controlling myself this week and you know i i probably just had one cup","4008":"doctor: okay yeah okay and so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it patient: it's on both the sides of my upper abdomen","4009":"doctor: hmmm okay patient: so i it also increases when i work out like if i wan na jog or like go for a run my abdominal pain just like spikes you know so i have to take it easy","4010":"doctor: okay alright understood you've not had any fever with that pain have you patient: no i have n't","4011":"doctor: okay alright and so how about your diabetes how's your diabetes been doing how your blood sugars been what low one hundreds two hundreds where where is it patient: i think it's been under control it's eight hundred so","4012":"doctor: okay good and you're still taking the metformin five hundred milligrams once a day right no actually it looks like last visit we increased that to five hundred milligrams twice per day is that correct patient: yes that's probably helping me keeping it under control so","4013":"doctor: okay good good and then for your asthma have you had any recent asthma attacks and are you still taking the flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed for wheezing patient: yes but sometimes i forget you know i have n't had any asthma attacks lately so i just figured i could decrease","4014":"doctor: yep okay patient: i think that's a good decision though","4015":"doctor: yeah well better to stay on the flovent daily and then just use the albuterol if you need it but if you stay on the flovent daily it will decrease the frequency of those attacks so yeah alright well let's go ahead and examine you okay so on your physical exam it's pretty normal for the most part unremarkable but i i'll i'll say on your on your heart exam you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam and and i'm not worried about that we're kinda watching that but it just means i hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving and otherwise normal heart exam for your abdominal exam you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen your abdomen's otherwise soft there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever and there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant so i think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen so i think that you know that may be you may be right this could be some gastritis so so then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam you do have some mild end expiratory wheezes very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam so let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here so first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain i do think that you have acute gastritis and i think this is probably related to the caffeine intake and i i know that you've had a a moderately heavy history of alcohol use too so i want you to cut back on the alcohol as well you know keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great and then also cut back on the caffeine and that should help and i'm going to write you a prescription for zantac as well as we need and so i'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain and then i'm going to check a urinalysis a urine pregnancy test a cbc a comprehensive metabolic panel as well and we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on and then for your second problem of diabetes type two let's continue you on the metformin but i wan na adjust the dose slightly i'm gon na increase the morning dose to one thousand milligrams and the evening dose we can keep at five hundred so we'll go metformin one thousand milligrams in the morning and five hundred milligrams in the evening please continue to check your blood sugars let me know what they are when you come back you know we just keep track of those and then we'll see you back in four weeks by the way i wan na have you follow up with me in four weeks and for your third problem of asthma let's continue you on the flovent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily and then also albuterol as needed so how does that sound for a plan any other questions comments suggestions patient: that sounds good and i also feel like i'm eating been eating a lot of spicy food","4016":"doctor: okay yeah i'd also recommend while this is hurting you definitely cut back on the spices the spicy food easier said than done sometimes i know but yep yep alright sounds good well listen i'll see you back in four weeks give me a holler if if you have any questions or anything else in the meantime patient: i will","4017":"doctor: alright you take care sure you got","4018":"doctor: good afternoon alexis i understand you're having some issues with your hand patient: yes i sit at the keyboard all day long and recently i've been having some numbness and tingling in my right hand","4019":"doctor: okay how long has that been going on patient: i do n't know probably on and off for six months but over the last month or so it's been a little more persistent","4020":"doctor: okay okay and when does that numbness and tingling do you get a lot of pain with it first let me ask that question patient: some pain","4021":"doctor: some pain patient: mostly when i'm actually typing on the keyboard is when i experience the pain","4022":"doctor: okay and when you get this pain what makes it better is it stopping and just resting for a while or do you take medications or try other patient: i've been taking ibuprofen so ibuprofen and seem like not typing on the keyboard helps the most","4023":"doctor: your mouth okay patient: wow","4024":"doctor: yeah when you're moving that around okay patient: yeah","4025":"doctor: does this pain ever wake you up in the middle of the night or the pain or the tingling patient: no","4026":"doctor: no okay patient: not affecting my sleep hmmm","4027":"doctor: okay so and you're using motrin for for ibuprofen for for the pain well let me go ahead and take a take a look here at your is it both hands or just your right hand patient: mostly my right hand","4028":"doctor: mostly your right hand okay so let's go ahead and take a look at that right hand when i bend your wrist does that cause any pain patient: yes","4029":"doctor: it does okay and so you do have some pain on extension and if you pull your your hand wrist up towards you does that cause the pain also patient: yes","4030":"doctor: yeah okay so you do have pain on flexion and extension and when i touch the fingertips here now you said you had some numbness in your thumb and your index finger and a little bit in your your middle finger the other two fingers they feel okay or do you think that there is different than the other hand patient: yeah for some reason it really is just that the thumb the pointer in the middle finger that i experience the most symptoms with","4031":"doctor: okay so i i want you to grip my hands here and just squeeze tight okay so you do have a a little bit of a less grip strength on the right and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain and and numbness that you have going on now i want you to turn your arm over for me and i'm gon na touch on or tap on the inside of your wrist or or forearm and when i do that i can see your face you're grimacing so that that that must cause that shooting pain yeah okay so you do have a positive tinel's sign so in alexis what i think is going on is that you have a a carpal tunnel syndrome and we see that frequent patient: i was afraid of","4032":"doctor: yeah you see this frequently but people who are doing data entry spend a lot of time on keyboards or you know some a lotta manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again and again will get that type of pain so here is my plan i'd like to put you in a splint and it's it's it's kind of a wrist splint i would like you to wear that at night that will help with that i want you to continue with the ibuprofens but i would like you to go up to six hundred milligrams four times a day and patient: okay","4033":"doctor: we're gon na do that now i am going to order some a a outpatient test called an emg where we look at that nerve conduction study in that wrist and that's really what's happening here is you've got some thickening in the the in the wrist and the the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down and just compressing some of those nerves any other questions for me for now if that test comes back positive and we'll talk about that later on your next visit if it comes back positive we may have to do we're gon na stick with conservative treatment first but we may consider some surgery where i can go in and release that impingement on your nerves through your wrist it's a simple outpatient procedure and then i think you would feel better how does that sound patient: that sounds like a good plan i was hoping maybe i could get some relief with some therapy rather than having to go to surgery so i like that plan very much","4034":"doctor: yeah we'll start with the the wrist splint and once i get the nerve conduction studies that will give me another idea whether or not i need to send you some physical therapy in addition or if we need to go directly to surgery but that will all hinge on that nerve conduction test do you so do you have any further questions patient: no that's great thank you so much","4035":"doctor: thank you very much","4036":"doctor: hey good to see you philip so i see here you're coming in you had some right elbow pain also you have a past medical history of hypertension diabetes we are gon na check up on those as well so can you tell me what happened to your elbow patient: sure i hurt it about a week ago playing lacrosse with my kids just suddenly started hurting me when i was throwing the ball","4037":"doctor: okay okay so how old are your kids patient: my oldest is thirteen and the other one is ten i was playing with a thirteen -year-old","4038":"doctor: okay yeah i know i i play with my kids sometimes and i think i'm getting too old to do all that so i just i've hurt myself before as well alright so with your your elbow what part of your elbow would you say hurts patient: it's really like right at the point of the elbow right at right at like the tip of it","4039":"doctor: anytime i move it do you remember falling patient: no i do n't think so but my kid got pretty rough with me and was checking me several times with a sick","4040":"doctor: okay alright yeah that that that definitely makes sense so how would you describe the pain is it like a dull pain is it stabbing what what would you say patient: it it's a pretty sharp pain","4041":"doctor: okay and does it radiate down your arm or does it stay in that one spot patient: it radiates down the forearm","4042":"doctor: radiates down the forearm alright so have you taken any medications for it to make it better patient: i tried taking advil couple of days but i usually just forget about it","4043":"doctor: okay when you took it did it did it help at all did it change your your pain score patient: yeah i i think it helped some","4044":"doctor: okay that's good alright so we'll we'll do a physical exam on that elbow we'll take a look at it in a second but i do wan na talk to you about your your hypertension you came in today i know you have past medical history of hypertension came in today your blood pressure's a little bit high it was a one fifty over seven over ninety which is pretty high today i see you're on twenty of lisinopril have you been taking that daily patient: yes","4045":"doctor: okay so maybe you just have a little little white coat syndrome i know i have that myself and even though i'm a physician i i still do n't like to go to the doctor so i definitely understand how about your diet i know we talked a little bit about that before and you said kinda during the pandemic you fell off a little bit how you been doing that have you been lowering your salt intake patient: yeah but i only eat low salt items avoid adding salt to food kind of the whole whole family follows like a you know like a mediterranean diet","4046":"doctor: okay yeah that's good that that's that's definitely good yeah i know a lot of people during the pandemic it was you know sitting at home and and eating more than we should but that's i'm very happy that you've been compliant and you have that low salt diet so let's talk about your diabetes i think you see here on on five hundred of metformin are you taking that as well daily patient: yes","4047":"doctor: okay and your blood sugars how have they been patient: since i do n't take insulin i do n't check it everyday when i have checked it it's usually running somewhere between eighty to a hundred","4048":"doctor: okay yeah that's that's really good yeah so i that's that's pretty good so what we're gon na do we're gon na get a a1c just to see you know that range and it's possibility we can we can you know lower that metformin dosage but we will do that after your visit then we will take a look at that so lem me go ahead and will do that quick exam of your elbow but first i want to make sure you're not having any chest pain or anything like that patient: no","4049":"doctor: no belly pain patient: no","4050":"doctor: alright so listen to your lungs so your lungs are clear bilaterally listen to your heart so your heart exam you do still have that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur but we know it about that before so let me take a look at your elbow so when i press right here on the back of your elbow is that painful patient: yes","4051":"doctor: alright so when i have you you you flex and extend it it's painful does that does that hurt patient: yes it does","4052":"doctor: alright so your right elbow exam shows you have pain to palpation of the olecranon area of the posterior elbow you do have mild pain with flexion and extension but you do have also normal range of motion at that elbow so we we did do an x-ray before you came in and luckily nothing's broken no fracture no bony abnormality so it's a normal x-ray which is really good so let me just talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have a elbow contusion i believe your son did hit you with the lacrosse stick and it caused that that pain i see some swelling little inflammation there as well you have a little bit of a bruise i think that's that's what happened so for that i know you're having some pain i'm gon na prescribe you eight hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that twice a day and that should help with some of that swelling and pain i also want you to ice it three times a day for twenty minutes at a time that should also help with the swelling and pain and just for the time being for the next couple of weeks just you know maybe you know not play lacrosse with your son just to help that heal then you can get back on on the field so for your your high blood pressure we're just gon na keep you on the hypertension we'll just keep you on that twenty milligrams of lisinopril looks like you're doing great with that and your diet and then for your diabetes we will keep you on the five hundred milligrams of metformin and we will also get a a1c just to check your levels and see if we do need to adjust the medication in the future alright so do you have any questions for me patient: no sounds good","4053":"doctor: alright so we will see you next time and my nurse will be in with those prescriptions patient: alright thank you","4054":"doctor: patient is an 82 -year-old male with past medical history significant for hypertension and stage three chronic kidney disease who presents for hospital follow-up after an acute on chronic chf exacerbation alright hey hey kevin how are you doing today patient: hi document well i mean i thought i was doing good but then i've been trying to watch my diet like you said and i really noticed that my ankles were swelling and then one day i got really super short of breath and i even had to call nine one one now when the paramedics got there they put me on the special mask to breathe when i got to the er the doctor in the er said my blood pressure was super high","4055":"doctor: yeah okay so yeah so i saw that and i was notified that you were in the hospital for heart failure now i do see here that your blood pressure was two hundred over ninety are you have you been taking your medications patient: well i take them most times but i do n't know sometimes i miss a dose or two but i really do try to take it for the most part","4056":"doctor: okay well good i'm i'm glad you're trying there you do need to take them though okay consistently now you said you were watching your diet did you have some slips you said your ankles were swelling patient: well be honest with you you know i'm a big cheese man i love me some football and and we go to parties on the weekends and i mean i i ca n't help it i really like pizza and i love chicken wings and i know i should n't have them but they are good and i want to eat them when i'm with my friends","4057":"doctor:

have to you know you have to watch those right you can you can you can have a little pizza maybe a little chicken wings every now and then but you know when you go to a lot of parties on weekends we we have to really watch that okay patient: yeah i mean you're wrong about the cowboys but yeah i guess you're right about everything else","4058":"doctor: okay thank you so tell me how are you feeling now though patient: man doc i feel good i was in the hospital a couple of days and they gave me this medicine made me go to the bathroom like nobody's business and then they gave me this water pill

zenthomas and also on your neck exam here there is no thyroid megaly so now on your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any hepatomegaly or splenomegaly why can i see these today so i reviewed the results of your cholesterol level and it was elevated at two ten so that's high so let me go ahead and tell you about my plan so for your problem of elevated cholesterol what we wan na do is you know the american academy of pediatrics actually recommends that all children be screened screened once you know they become between ages and nine and eleven and then again between ages seventeen and twenty so that's why you were screened okay so we do we yeah so we do this because studies have shown a link between high cholesterol and premature heart attacks so i wan na go ahead and order a full cholesterol panel there could be other reasons that could be causing the the high cholesterol but i'll go ahead also and check some glucose a complete metabolic panel some thyroid studies and liver panels and i wan na perform a genetic testing to see if this problem is familial or this is a secondary cause so we are also gon na go ahead i wan na follow up in a follow-up with a well balanced diet so including a variety of foods that are lower in saturated fat and sugars so i want you to follow that and i want you to meet a nutritionist and so who can give you information about what kind of foods to eat okay patient: okay","4107":"doctor: alright now i do want you to continue to be active and exercise so that's great especially that you know your bike riding so you keep that up that's a great thing and you're doing well with that so keep that up for you okay and then i wan na follow up with another cholesterol level in three to six months after you've met with the nutritionist and then and they've you know instituted those dietary changes patient: okay it sounds good","4108":"doctor: okay good well take care julie i'll talk to you soon patient: alright thanks

okay are you having it now or is it gone right now patient: right now it's not there","4112":"doctor: okay and how long have you been having this patient: probably maybe three months","4113":"doctor: okay and what seemed to bring it on anything exacerbated or relieve it patient: it mainly happens when i'm walking i like to try and walk but lately i just have n't been able to keep up with it because i'm having this pain","4114":"doctor: alright and well how would you describe this pain it's like a dull pain sharp pain stabbing pain how would you describe it patient: i would say it's dull it's kinda like a pressure","4115":"doctor: okay and does it go anywhere or radiate any place patient: no","4116":"doctor: okay alright but no chest pain right now no shortness of breath no sweats or clamminess or anything like that right now patient: nothing right now","4117":"doctor: okay alright well certainly you know i looked at your ekg that did we did in the office when you came in the ekg i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so i'm you know we should definitely talk about the plan for this chest pain in a few minutes but right now the good news is i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so let's talk a little bit about your other conditions since you are here today how are you doing with your diabetes i know we have you on metformin and we talked about last time about you know improving your diet and exercise i'm glad you're exercising but i'm so sorry to hear about the chest pain so tell me about how is that going patient: yeah i mean i think my blood sugars have been a little higher because i have n't been able to be active and i'm trying with the diet you know i do love sodas so i'm really trying strength dose","4118":"doctor: yeah i i am addicted to diet coke myself so i i hear you on that one and we had checked your hemoglobin a1c last time it was you know seven . which is pretty good it's not you know it could be better but it's not it's not bad and we talked about sending you to ophthalmology also for an eye exam have you seen ophthalmology in the last few months or last before i saw you patient: i have an appointment in two weeks it was a long waiting","4119":"doctor: okay got it and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that with your diabetes or any side effects from your medications the metformin patient: no","4120":"doctor: okay alright good and i saw also there was a record in your i was looking at your record before previously before i walked in you also had we've been checking your blood pressure but but i think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure have you noticed any findings with that or have you know have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that because we do n't have it in our system here yet but i did add it in today but we do n't have you on any medications yet for that patient: no i mean i do n't know doc no one told me about high blood pressure do i have high blood pressure","4121":"doctor: well i think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the your blood pressure was elevated so they had mentioned that i noticed a trend in your blood pressure it's been running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years patient: okay do you think that could be causing me my my chest pain","4122":"doctor: it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so patient: someone had told me before","4123":"doctor: yeah me too but we we can we can definitely you know get you started on some monitoring devices for that and also maybe start you on some some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure and maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay patient: okay sounds good","4124":"doctor: so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness so what does all this mean i'll explain that in a second so basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs so you know with this chest pain i'm a little bit so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily i'm also gon na give you a prescription just a baby aspirin you can take eighty one milligrams once a day and also i'm gon na give you a prescription for nitroglycerin it's a it's a little pill you split underneath your tongue if you have this chest pain if it does n't go away after one or two pills i want you to go to the hospital call nine one one and go to the hospital but we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart okay any questions about that patient: so anytime i have a chest pain even if i'm just like walking i have to take that pill","4125":"doctor: yeah if you if you stop walking the chest pain goes away you do n't have to take the pill but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away i would take the pill and see if it goes away if it does not patient: how long like how long do i wait to see if it goes away","4126":"doctor: about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes and if it does n't go away then i would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because i worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it does n't lead to a heart attack those chest pain could be a you know a a a sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly patient: okay","4127":"doctor: alright patient: mm-hmm","4128":"doctor: and for the second problem the diabetes you know i think you're doing fairly well continue with your eye ophthalmology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today and i'm gon na have you come back in about two weeks and we can see if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away from you know the the pop and the sweet things and once we have your heart taken care of or make sure your heart is okay you can and we can hopefully resolve this chest pain that you're having get back to your exercise regimen okay any questions about that patient: no","4129":"doctor: okay and for the third diagnosis the high blood pressure you you do have a trend i've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure's been running a little bit high several other people have documented as well i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide it's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus it'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your in your feet i'm gon na have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at epic mychart and i'll get a reading of those as well and then what when you come back in two weeks we'll keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going and then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling i think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is a probably a good idea patient: okay are there any side effects with this medication","4130":"doctor: yeah it can cause sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom a little bit more often in the evening but generally most people do n't have a whole lot of side effects i'll give you a handout of the side effects but sometimes you can have a cross reaction with some other medications like sulfa medications but generally most people tolerate this pretty well patient: okay","4131":"doctor: alright any other questions we got patient: that's it","4132":"doctor: alright well great seeing you thanks for coming in today patient: thank you appreciate it","4133":"doctor: hey sophia how are you doing today patient: i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you because of this knee pain that i've been having for about six months now","4134":"doctor: okay do you remember what caused the pain initially patient: you know i really ca n't recall any specific event that caused the pain","4135":"doctor: alright well can can you describe the pain for me patient: yeah so it's it's like a deep achy pain that it i feel like it's behind my kneecaps and sometimes i can even hear like what seems like like some creaking in my knees","4136":"doctor: hmmm alright now tell me what what type of activities makes that pain worse patient: so i feel like the pain gets worse anytime i'm like getting from like a seated position to standing so i i work from home so i'm at my desk a lot so anytime i get up i have some pain or after watching tv or even like going up and down stairs it's really painful","4137":"doctor: hmmm okay and does anything make the pain feel better patient: usually after i rest it for some time it does help with the pain","4138":"doctor: okay now you did mention earlier that you have tried some things in the past can you tell me what they were patient: yeah so when it first started hurting i was putting ice on it and i even got like some ace bandage like wrapping from the pharmacy i do take ibuprofen or aleve sometimes but i try to avoid really taking any medications","4139":"doctor: okay and and tell me what is your day like patient: well i try to be as active as i can i actually love to run and i would run like five to six miles a day but now i i mean honestly i ca n't even get to half a mile and my leg will start hurting my knee will start hurting","4140":"doctor: okay that's definitely a decrease in your mileage there where have you been running lately like do you run outside or on a treadmill or patient: yeah i i you know i will do the treadmill during the winter but i just love being outdoors and running","4141":"doctor: yeah yeah there are some really nice senior routes here in boston is n't there like patient: there are","4142":"doctor: so many knee places there's some right by the harbor that i've i've done some runs there before too it's pretty nice well i mean the boston marathon what can you say right patient: right exactly exactly no it's very nice","4143":"doctor: well okay well hopefully that we get you feeling better so you can start running again more than . five miles but tell me though have you noticed any swelling or redness in your knees patient: no not really","4144":"doctor: okay and have you ever injured your knees before patient: no i've been pretty good i actually have never broken a bone actually no i'm gon na change that actually i did break my arm when i was in sixth grade but nothing since then","4145":"doctor: okay and it's just your arm right not not your knee patient: right","4146":"doctor: okay well alright well let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here let me look at your vital signs okay i reviewed your vitals they they overall they look good take a listen to your heart real quick alright and your heart exam i hear regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs and on your musculoskeletal exam i have seen you and walk around here and you do have normal gait alright now i'm gon na have you do some movements on your legs here okay patient: okay","4147":"doctor: alright good your strength is three out of five for abduction of legs bilaterally and the remainder of muscle strength for your lower extremities are five out of five so that's good let me take a look at your knee now on your knee exam there is no overlying erythema that's redness or ecchymosis and that's bruising or any warmth of the skin appreciated there is no effusion let me go ahead and feel around here does that hurt right here how does that feel patient: it does","4148":"doctor: sorry so there is tenderness to palpation of the bilateral retinacular retinaculum and there is positive patellar grind test alright and can you are you able to squat for me patient: i can but that hurts","4149":"doctor: okay alright so you're definitely having some knee pain with squatting and i'm just gon na maneuver your leg just a little bit here real quick okay so lachman anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray tests are all negative bilaterally so that's good there okay now your neuro exam patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical alright so now i did review the results of your x-ray and both of your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan so for your problem of bilateral knee pain based on what you told me your exam and reviewing your mri your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a very common condition that we see that causes knee pain especially in active young people so this condition has to do with the way your kneecap which is your patella how that moves along the groove of your thigh your thigh bone which is the femur now for the pain you may continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatory as needed to help with the pain but i'm also going to recommend physical therapy where where they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you may have so do you have any questions for me about that patient: will i be able to run anytime soon","4150":"doctor: well that is a goal of treatment and to get you back in running again now you will have to take an take it easy from running for now but we will continue to assess your progress with each visit okay patient: okay","4151":"doctor: alright anything else patient: no i think that's it","4152":"doctor: okay well very good well i will be following up with you soon and again just take it easy for now from the running okay patient: okay thank you","4153":"doctor: hey kyle so i see here on your chart that you've been having some back pain could you tell me like how you've been doing what's going on patient: yeah i have this real bad low back pain it started a couple of weeks ago i was lifting something and i just felt a pop and i i do n't know what's going on","4154":"doctor: okay and so you were like moving what what were you moving exactly when you say lifting patient: i was lifting a box of books","4155":"doctor: alright did we use proper lifting technique do you wonder patient: you know probably not","4156":"doctor: okay alright i'm sorry about that alright can you describe the pain for me patient: yeah i i feel like kind of it's like achy and sharp","4157":"doctor: uh uh and does the pain like radiate anywhere patient: you know it did n't at first but now i'm feeling it's kinda starting to shoot down my left leg","4158":"doctor: okay alright and how is positioning for you does any sitting in any particular position hurt more or hurt less patient: no sitting is usually okay for me","4159":"doctor: mm-hmm okay and then do you have any numbness or tingling associated with the pain patient: no","4160":"doctor: okay alright any loss of sensation patient: no","4161":"doctor: okay how yes sir okay how about any weakness patient: no i do n't feel any weakness","4162":"doctor: okay and i know this sounds like a weird question but i do need to know do you experience any loss of control of your bladder or bowels patient: no","4163":"doctor: alright this this is a no judgment zone i there i'm working through some things in my head to make sure that i give you the best care

some ibuprofen and tylenol","4164":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: that that sometimes helps","4165":"doctor: okay alright and has anyone discussed the option of like just no has anyone discussed surgery with you patient: no this is the first time i'm talking about it","4166":"doctor: okay alright that's good so what is your like how what is your activity level right now that i know that you're you know an olympic weightlifter with books what else do you do to like exercise patient: you know i try to exercise a few times a week but i'm pretty inconsistent i have a sedentary job","4167":"doctor:

previously","4168":"doctor: alright so do you have any family members that have spine conditions patient: yeah my dad has back pain","4169":"doctor: okay alright and then do you smoke patient: i do n't smoke","4170":"doctor: okay awesome alright so sorry one question did you do you have a history of playing sports patient: yes","4171":"doctor: okay what did you play patient: soccer","4172":"doctor: okay what position patient: i played midfield","4173":"doctor: okay the people who hide in the back that's fine i was centered forward fine no baby do you have a team that you wrote for patient: you know i am a tatnham hotsper fan","4174":"doctor: they have the best colors not going to lie but i i grew up manu so sorry patient: well i wo n't fault you for that","4175":"doctor: thanks okay so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings just to have them recorded and if you have any questions please feel free to stop me and let me know okay patient: okay","4176":"doctor: alright so looking at your vitals your blood pressure seems alright we are in like the one thirty over seventy range that's perfectly fine your respiratory rate i have you at an eighteen again pretty normal when i listen here to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops that means your heart sounds great on your respiratory exam your lungs sound clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal back exam as i'm looking here i do n't notice any overlying redness or bruising on the skin when i push here on the midline of your back does it hurt patient: yes","4177":"doctor: okay so there is midline tenderness at the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness alright so are you able to bend forward patient: yes","4178":"doctor: alright and are you able to bend backward patient: yes","4179":"doctor: alright do either of those actions cause you pain patient: bending forward","4180":"doctor: okay so pain with lumbar flexion and so i'm gon na have you lie down and we're gon na do i'm sorry okay and then i see that a supine straight leg test is positive alright so for your neurological exam you said that you are experiencing pain radiating down radiating down your left leg correct patient: yes","4181":"doctor: alright when i touch are there any like decreased sensation patient: no","4182":"doctor: okay alright so patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical alright so i received before you came in here we got an mri and so in reviewing your results it does show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right neuroforaminal i do n't like this word neural foraminal stenosis what those complicated words is that i just said is that it seems that you have a a a herniated disk with nerve impingement so let's talk about my assessment and plan alright your symptoms are in line with a i'm sorry you have lumbar back pain at the l4 l5 disk space due to a herniated disk with radiculopathy this means that one of your disks that sits between your vertebrae like the bones in your spine is bulging out and the bulge is pinching on some nerves so that's why you are feeling that pain like radiating down your leg i'm gon na recommend something a spinal injection with a strong nsaid and called the i'm sorry and a corticosteroid i'm just gon na inject it into the lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of like an x-ray to localize the exact area of your pain this should help with the inflammation that's causing your pain i know that sounds a bit scary it this is a typical procedure that i do all the time it's in office and we can get you scheduled today if you would like so what questions do you have right now patient: is that something that we can do today","4183":"doctor: yeah i think i have time in my schedule to get it done today just you know i'm here for you right now patient: alright","4184":"doctor: there are sorry yeah you're right there are risks associated with this kind of injection just like any procedure but we aim to minimize them and my ma when she comes in we will give you some paperwork with explanations and any and hopefully answer most of the questions that you have if after reading that you have any more questions please feel free to stop us we want to make sure that you feel as comfortable as possible during this time patient: okay","4185":"doctor: alright patient: great","4186":"doctor: anything else patient: i think that's it","4187":"doctor: alright","4188":"doctor: angela good to see you today so i'm writing here in my notes that you're you're coming in you had some left knee pain so how did you hurt your knee patient: yeah so i hurt my knee the other day when i was running around with my niece she she is learning how to take off the training wheels for her bike","4189":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: and i fell and i think i twisted my knee in some kind of funky way","4190":"doctor: okay that that that that's not good how old are your niece patient: she is five and perfect","4191":"doctor: well that's good that you're trying to help her with the learning how to ride a bike patient: yeah","4192":"doctor: that sounds fun but i'm i'm sad as you hurt your knee doing it so for your knee pain are you are you able to bear weight on that leg the left leg patient: well i've been limping ever since and it really has n't gotten better so i thought it was maybe time to come see you because it happened about a week ago","4193":"doctor: yeah yeah it's a definitely a good time to come see me so what part of your knee would you say it hurts patient: honestly it's been hurting on both sides more so on the inside than the the outside","4194":"doctor: so okay so more in the medial aspect less on the lateral okay that makes sense and you said did you hear a pop when you when you twisted it patient: yeah i did","4195":"doctor: okay alright so how would you rate your pain with your knee out of out of one to ten patient: it started off as like a four but i think it's getting worse and it's starting like it's it's like a like a throbbing kind of pain yeah","4196":"doctor: alright and have you taken anything for the pain patient: yeah so i i had like a ulcer not too long ago so my doctor told me that i could n't take any like kind of advil or ibuprofen","4197":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: so i've been taking some tylenol and i wrapped it with kinesiology tape are you familiar with that","4198":"doctor: yep yeah i'm i'm familiar patient: okay","4199":"doctor: alright and has the has the ibuprofen been helping you at all patient: i ca n't take ibuprofen","4200":"doctor: i mean i'm sorry the tylenol patient: no it's okay but the tylenol it helps like a little bit but you know like it's it's got like a time limit right so by the time and i'm not supposed to take it like more than like every like four hours or something like that but by hour or two like it it hurts again","4201":"doctor: okay yeah that yeah you ca n't take too much of that tylenol because it'll it'll mess up your liver definitely patient: right","4202":"doctor: alright so go ahead and do a quick exam on your knee here so when i press here does that hurt patient: yeah like when you press on the inside that hurts a lot","4203":"doctor: okay alright i'm gon na do a couple of other other maneuvers here for your knee so on your left knee exam i do appreciate some edema you also have some effusion some fluid in the knee you have moderate range of motion so you're able to move it a little bit but not all the way i also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee even negative lachman's test and a negative valgus and varus test as well so all that to say is i do n't think anything is is torn in your knee based on the your physical exam so we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so everything is good there so let me talk to you little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay patient: yeah","4204":"doctor: alright so for your your left knee pain i believe you you have a mcl strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee i think when you were running with your knee she had somehow twisted it and so you strained that ligament there so for that what i want to do i'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an nsaid so i will put you on some tramadol you can take fifty milligrams you can do that twice a day and then you can take that tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain alright i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer leg knee immobilizer and you can wear that for the next week i just wan na keep the knee from moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here and i also want you to ice it and you can do that three or four times a day for twenty thirty minutes at a time and that should help some of that swelling as well and i i you know i know your niece is gon na be upset but i just do n't want you to be running probably for the next three weeks with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal so how does that sound patient: that's alright how long do you think it'll be before i can like run or something like that","4205":"doctor: hmmm i think you'll be back to normal in about a month the strain does n't seem too bad but we just need to get you off of the knee so we can allow it to heal i mean once we do that you know along with you know the icing the mobilization and you taking the medication i think you'll be good to go in a month if you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse please feel free to call the office and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an mri to you know to see if it's anything worse but i do n't think it is but just let us know how you feel in a couple of days patient: okay alright thanks","4206":"doctor: alright any other questions patient: no that's it","4207":"doctor: alright great thanks","4208":"doctor: hi diane , how are you ? patient: i'm doing okay , how are you ?","4209":"doctor: i'm doin' okay . so i know the nurse told you about dax and i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you okay ? patient: okay .","4210":"doctor: diane is a 28 year old female with a past medical history , significant for , depression and hypertension who presents for emergency room follow-up . so diane what's going on ? i heard that your- your blood pressure was really high in the emergency room . what happened ? patient: yeah , so i ended up going for a walk , um , yesterday 'cause it was sunny and it was really great . and i just felt really light-headed , um , and i started to fall a bit , and , um , luckily i was with my boyfriend and he caught me , um , and then we went right to the e , to the er .","4211":"doctor: yeah , okay . yeah , i saw that the blood pressure was pretty high , like in , like , the , almost 200 . patient: yeah .","4212":"doctor: did you have a headache ? patient: yeah i did .","4213":"doctor: okay , all right . have your blood pressures been running high in the past ? patient: yeah , they have been . it's- it's , like , once a week , a month , it , kind of , just skyrockets .","4214":"doctor: you're not taking your blood pressures , i take it- patient: yeah .","4215":"doctor: . when you're traveling ? patient: yeah , no , i do n't bring my cuff with me .","4216":"doctor: okay , but you did buy the cuff like we talked about in the past ? patient: yes i did .","4217":"doctor: okay , all right . and are you taking your medication , are you taking the lisinopril ? patient: yes i am .","4218":"doctor: okay , all right . um , so i think we had started you at a , kind of , a moderate dose , so we'll have to talk about that a little bit , okay ? patient: okay .","4219":"doctor: then in terms of your depression , how are you doing ? i know that we did n't start you on medication , since you're on a bunch of other medications . what- what are your strategies for dealing with that and how are you doing ? patient: so last year i started therapy and i've been going once a week and that's really helped .","4220":"doctor: okay , all right , great . and how is your support system ? patient: really great . my boyfriend , my mom , and my brother are- are s- , amazing and they're all super close to me , so it's been , it's been good .","4221":"doctor: okay , well great . so i know you did a review of system sheet when you checked in and i know that you had the headache and the lightheadedness yesterday . do you have any other symptoms at this time , chest pain , shortness of breath , anything like that ? patient: uh , i have a little bit of nasal congestion , but that's just from my seasonal allergies .","4222":"doctor: okay , all right . well i want to go ahead and do a quick physical exam , okay ? patient: okay .","4223":"doctor: hey , dragon , show me the blood pressure . so , yeah , looking at your blood pressure today here in the office , it does look a little elevated still , so we'll have to talk about that . so i'm just gon na listen to your heart and your lungs and we'll go from there okay ? patient: okay .","4224":"doctor: so on physical examination , i- i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits in your neck . your heart on your heart exam , it does show that you have a slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur . your , there , your lung exam shows nice clear lungs bilaterally and you do have some trace pitting edema to your lower extremities bilaterally . so what that means is , you know , i- i think ultimately , uh , you know we just need to get your blood pressure under better control , okay ? patient: mm-hmm .","4225":"doctor: um , uh , let me just go ahead , i want to take a look at some of your results , okay ? patient: okay .","4226":"doctor: hey , dragon , show me the ecg . yeah , so in reviewing the results of your ekg , it looks the same as last year . um , you do have just blood , those changes from your chronic high blood pressure that we'll address , okay ? hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram . and this is just the echocardiogram from just a few months ago that just , you know , show that you have that slightly leaky heart valve , nothing to do for it , and that the heart murmur is stable , okay ? patient: okay .","4227":"doctor: so let's just talk a little bit about , you know , my assessment and my plan for you . so , for your first problem , your high blood pressure , it's not controlled at this time , so i want to go ahead and increase the lisinopril to 40 milligrams once a day . i want you to continue to check your blood pressures and report them to me through the patient portal and we'll have to make adjustments if necessary and maybe have to add a second agent , okay ? patient: okay .","4228":"doctor: and then for your second problem , uh , i want , you know , for your depression , i do n't think that we need to start you on any medication , it sounds like you're doing really well from that standpoint , but you know that you can contact me if you , if you need anything , okay ? patient: okay .","4229":"doctor: do you have any questions ? patient: no , not at this time .","4230":"doctor: okay , all right , well it's good to see you . patient: good seeing you too .","4231":"doctor: hey , dragon , finalize the note .","4232":"doctor: hi alan , how are you ? patient: hi , good to see you .","4233":"doctor: good to see you as well . are you ready to get started ? patient: yes i am .","4234":"doctor: so , alan is a 61-year-old male , here with complaints of shortness of breath . so alan , what's going on ? patient: so over the weekend , uh , i took a very long bike ride , about three hours or so and i got back , i was very light headed , i was short of breath and it really surprised me because i pretty much bike ride every morning and it was never an issue before so i'm a little concerned about that .","4235":"doctor: okay , and have you had any other symptoms ? have you had any fever- patient: no-","4236":"doctor: . chest pain ? patient: no , but i felt very light headed and , uh , i- it was hard to catch my breath afterwards , so maybe i did have a little chest pain but , uh , it , it eventually went away after about an hour .","4237":"doctor: okay , um , and anyone else sick in your , in your family ? patient: no .","4238":"doctor: okay , and any cough ? patient: um , i had a little bit of a cough with my first cold in the last year and a half , but that went away after about a week or so .","4239":"doctor: okay , all right . um , and any other symptoms ? i know you went through the review of symptoms- patient: mm-hmm .","4240":"doctor: . with the nurse but any nausea or vomiting or abdominal pain ? patient: n- no .","4241":"doctor: okay . all right . well , i know that i've treated you for migraines in the past . how are you doing with those ? patient: that's been under control . i've , uh , taken medication , i've , uh , avoided bright lights and it's so far so good .","4242":"doctor: okay . all right . and i think we had you on imitrex for that . have you- patient: yes , i'm still taking that .","4243":"doctor: all right . and then your reflux , how are you doing with that ? patient: managing that as well .","4244":"doctor: okay and everything's working out well with the protonix ? patient: yes .","4245":"doctor: okay . and then i know you had the cataract surgery about three months ago , your vision is okay ? patient: that was about four and a half months ago and it's been actually great ever since .","4246":"doctor: okay , great . all right , well , we're gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam . i wan na see your vital signs first . patient: sure .","4247":"doctor: hey dragon , show me the vital signs . okay , so looking here , everything looks quite good . your oxygenation is perfect , which is wonderful . let me just take a listen . deep breath . another one . good . so , on your physical exam , your neck is nice and supple . i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distension . your heart is in a regular rhythm , i do n't hear any murmur . your lungs do have a slight wheeze , expiratory wheeze , bilaterally . i can hear it every time you breathe and i see trace lower extremity edema in your lower extremities . patient: so what does all that mean ?","4248":"doctor: you know , you , uh , i'm not quite sure yet but we're gon na review some of your results . hey dragon , show me the chest x-ray . so looking here , this is a very normal chest x-ray . um , i do n't see any pulmonary edema , there's no pneumonia , so we're viewing your chest x-ray as , it's a norm- it's normal . patient: good .","4249":"doctor: so , let's look at your pulmonary function test . hey dragon , show me your , the pfts . and looking here again , these look quite good , i'm , i'm quite encouraged by that . that's , that's normal pulmonary function tests . hey dragon , show me the labs . and all of your labs here look quite good here as well so , i- i- i'm very pleased . so , right now my impression of you is that you may have had an asthma exacerbation from exercising and with the allergies , so at this point in time i'd like to go ahead and prescribe you some albuterol inhaler . patient: mm-hmm .","4250":"doctor: two puffs every four hours as needed for wheezing or for shortness of breath . and , i'd like to go ahead and order a pulmonary referral for you , okay . do you have any questions about that ? patient: no questions , thanks .","4251":"doctor: hey dragon , order a pulmonary referral . hey dragon , order albuterol inhaler , two puffs every four hours , as needed for shortness of breath . and then i think from your reflux standpoint , everything seems stable and your migraines , i think that we should just continue on with the imitrex , as needed . does that sound good to you ? patient: that sounds fine .","4252":"doctor: i wan na see you in a couple weeks and if you have this shortness of breath again , i want you to call me right away , okay ? patient: you got it .","4253":"doctor: all right . good to see you . patient: same here .","4254":"doctor: hey dragon , finalize the note .","4255":"doctor: hi joyce , how are you ? patient: i'm good . how are you ?","4256":"doctor: i'm doing well . so , i know the nurse told you about dax . i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you when we get started , okay ? patient: okay .","4257":"doctor: all right . so , joyce is a 50 year old female with a past medical history significant for copd , congestive heart failure who presents for follow-up to an abnormal lab finding . so , joyce , i , i got the results of your lab , uh , your labs . your hemoglobin was low . uh , so , i asked them to schedule a follow-up appointment with me . so , how are you feeling ? patient: i've been feeling really tired lately . over the past couple of months , i've noticed that my energy has really gone down . i used to be really active , um , just trying to be as healthy as i can be , running, climbing . um , i at least try to do an hour or two a day . and over the past month , it's gone slowly downhill . i've just been so tired and exhausted and i have n't been able to really keep up with the way i , i was g- was going with my exercise .","4258":"doctor: okay . all right . um , now , have you had ... have you noticed any blood in your stools at all ? patient: uh , no , not really . not , not at this time .","4259":"doctor: okay . and are your stools , like , dark or charry or black looking ? patient: no . not that i've noticed .","4260":"doctor: okay . and are you spotting a lot with your periods ? patient: no , i'm not .","4261":"doctor: okay . all right . um , and do you have any other ... i know that you are endorsing this fatigue and you feel kind of dizzy and that type of thing . do you have any other symptoms like chest pain , shortness of breath , fever , chills , body aches , anything ? patient: no , nothing like that .","4262":"doctor: okay . any weight loss ? patient: um , i've noticed a little bit , but that's because i think i've been doing really well with my exercise . um , but nothing too significant .","4263":"doctor: okay . all right . well , let me ask you a little bit about how's the , the copd doing . i , i know that , you know , you've stopped smoking several years ago , but , you know , you still have that em- those emphysema changes on your chest x-ray . so , how are you doing with that ? how's your breathing ? patient: it's been okay . um , i have n't been smoking . i ... after i quit , i quit cold turkey and i have n't gone back since . so , that's been doing well . i think , uh , during the changes of season , it gets a little bit harder for me to breathe , but i think that's just because of my allergies .","4264":"doctor: okay . all right . and then from a congestive heart failure standpoint , are you watching your diet , you're watching your salt intake ? patient: yeah . i've been doing really well with that . i've been staying away from the french fries , and all the other salty foods that i love to eat , uh , and everything looks great .","4265":"doctor: um , so , french fries are one of my favorite foods , that and fried chicken , so- i give you a lot of credit for staying away from french fries . patient: thank you .","4266":"doctor: um , okay . so , you ... so , no swelling in your legs or any- anything like that . patient: no , not that i've noticed .","4267":"doctor: okay . and you feel like you have a good support system ? patient: yeah . my boyfriend is , is great and i have , um , my brother right down the road .","4268":"doctor: okay . all right . good . i'm glad to hear that . uh , so , let's go ahead . i wan na just do a quick physical exam , okay ? patient: okay .","4269":"doctor: hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . all right . well , your vital signs here in the office look good , so , i'm , i'm really happy to see that with the abnormal hemoglobin that we saw . um , i'm gon na just listen to your heart and lungs and press on your belly a little bit and i'll let you know if i find anything , okay ? patient: okay .","4270":"doctor: all right . okay . all right . so , on physical exam , you know , i , i do n't appreciate anything cervical lymphadenopathy . your heart sounds really good , but i do hear a , a slight two out of six systolic heart , uh , murmur , um , systolic ejection murmur on your heart exam . your lungs sound clear . your abdomen ... you know , you did have a little tenderness to palpation in your right lower quadrant on your abdominal exam , uh , but i do n't appreciate any lower extremity edema . so , all that means it that we , you know , we hear that heart murmur , which we heard in the past , um , and your belly had some tenderness , so we'll have to talk about that a little bit , uh , going forward , okay ? patient: okay .","4271":"doctor: let's look at some of your results , okay ? patient: mm-hmm .","4272":"doctor: hey , dragon , show me the hemoglobin . so , here , looking at this , you know , your hemoglobin level is 8.2. somebody like you should have a hemoglobin o- of about 13 , 14 , okay ? patient: okay .","4273":"doctor: so , we need to investigate why it's low . hey , dragon , show me the anemia labs . okay . so , looking here at your labs , uh , everything looks good from , from this standpoint . i think some of your anemia labs are still pending at this time that's part of the workup . patient: mm-hmm .","4274":"doctor: so , let's go over a little bit about the assessment and plan for you . so , you know , your main problem , this abnormal lab , this low hemoglobin that we found , so , you're anemic and we nee- ... you know , i'm waiting for those anemia labs to come back to find out exactly , you know , what type of anemia you have . i'd like to go ahead and schedule you for an endoscopy a- and a colonoscopy just to make sure that you're not bleeding from your , inside your belly , okay ? um , and i'm ... i'll be in touch when those labs come back to see what further workup we need to do , okay ? patient: mm-hmm .","4275":"doctor: for your next problem , the copd , i think you're doing great . you know , i , i do n't think that you , uh , need any further referrals at this time for that . i would just continue staying away from smoking . it does n't sound to be like you need any inhalers at this time . uh , for your third problem , your congestive heart failure , you know , i wan na continue you on the toprol , continue you on the lisinopril and we'll continue you on your current diuretic dosing of 20 , lasix 20 milligrams a day . i'm gon na go ahead and order that referral to g- to gastroenterology . they're the ones who will do the endoscopy and the colonoscopy , okay ? patient: okay .","4276":"doctor: hey , dragon , order the referral to gastroenterology . so , i'll be in touch . i'm gon na stay in close contact with you over the next week or so and , uh , we'll get this all sorted out , okay ? patient: okay .","4277":"doctor: all right . take care , joyce . patient: thank you .","4278":"doctor: hey , dragon , finalize the note .","4279":"doctor: hi evelyn , how are you ? patient: i'm good , how are you ?","4280":"doctor: i'm good . it's good to see you . patient: good to see you too .","4281":"doctor: so i know the nurse told you a little bit about dax . i'm gon na tell dax about you , okay ? patient: okay .","4282":"doctor: so evelyn is a 56-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease , prior carpal tunnel release , and a herniated disc who presents for her annual exam . so evelyn it's been a little while since i've seen you , how have you been doing over the last year ? patient: i've been doing okay , um , everything , um , with my herniated disc in my back has been doing really well . i have n't had any , um , back pain , or any , um , limitations in movement , so that's been doing well .","4283":"doctor: okay , yeah , i know that we have done a steroid injection for that , uh , a couple of month- , uh , several months ago , so that's- that's doing well ? patient: yeah , it is .","4284":"doctor: okay , i'm

but i have n't had any of the other symptoms you mentioned .","4288":"doctor: okay , does the chest pain happen when you walk ? patient: yeah , it does .","4289":"doctor: okay , and does it- does it go away if you- if you rest ? patient: yeah , it does actually .","4290":"doctor: okay , all right . do you ever get it just sitting there at rest ? patient: no i do n't .","4291":"doctor: okay , all right . okay , and- and can you describe it ? patient: it's like a burn .","4292":"doctor: okay , and where exactly is it located in your chest ? patient: just , um , right in the middle ...","4293":"doctor: okay . and how often are you getting it ? patient: um , probably about three- three times a week .","4294":"doctor: okay , all right . well i'm glad that you talked about that with me today , um , i know the nurse did a review of systems sheet with you , and , you know , you're obviously endorsing this- this chest pressure . um , have you had any other symptoms , i know the- the other ones that you have n't had , but any lower extremity edema , or muscle aches , or fever chills ? patient: no , nothing like that , but i have had a little bit of congestion , um , just from allergies , because of the pollen .","4295":"doctor: okay , so you're endorsing some nasal congestion ? patient: yeah .","4296":"doctor: all right , well let's go ahead and we'll do a physical exam , okay ? patient: okay .","4297":"doctor: hey dragon ? show me the vital signs . so here your vital signs look really good , i'm- i'm happy to see that your blood pressure is under- under good control , and your oxygenation is fine , so i'm just gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , and i'll let you know if i find anything , okay ? patient: okay .","4298":"doctor: okay , so in physical exam your heart has a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard before . your lungs are nice and clear , uh , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits , and- and you have no lower extremity edema , you have healed , uh , surgical scars on your- on your , uh , right wrist . um , so let's go ahead , i wan na look at some of your results , okay ? patient: okay .","4299":"doctor: hey dragon , show me the echocardiogram ? so this is the echocardiogram from last year , you know , you did have a slightly low pumping function of your heart at 45 % , but , uh , i- , you know , i suspected that will improve over time , and you did have some slight , what we call , mitral regurgitation , that's just a leaky heart valve , and that's that murmur that i heard . hey dragon , show me the ecg ? and here , you know , in reviewing your results of your e- ecg , you know , it looks stable , it just kinda reflects your prior coronary artery disease . there's no new changes , which is good , so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you . so , from your first problem , you know , your carpal tunnel release , i do n't think that we need to anything further about that , 'cause you seem to be doing really well , you're back at work , if you have any recurring symptoms , just let me know , and we can take it from there . for your next problem , your herniated disc , that also sounds like your doing really well , i do n't think that we need to refer you for any further steroid injection , or physical therapy at this time . so , if you have recurrent symptoms , i want you to let me know . and finally , your last problem , the most concerning problem to me is your known coronary artery disease , and this recurrent chest pain you have . so , i wan na go ahead and continue you on your asprin , and your toprol , okay ? i wan na go ahead and order a stress test for you to see if you have more blockages that could be causing this chest discomfort , okay ? patient: okay .","4300":"doctor: and i'm gon na go ahead and get a lipid panel and , uh , start you on crestor 20 mg , once a day , okay ? patient: okay .","4301":"doctor: hey dragon , order a cardiac stress test . do you have any questions ? patient: no , that's it .","4302":"doctor: okay , all right . hey dragon , finalize the note . so , it was good to see you , the nurse will come in , she'll help you get your scheduled for all of those things , and i'll be in touch , okay ? patient: okay .","4303":"doctor: take care .","4304":"doctor: morning roy , how are you doing ? patient: hey , good to see you .","4305":"doctor: so , my nurse told you a little bit about dax ? so , if you do n't mind , i'm going to tell dax a little bit about you today . patient: perfect .","4306":"doctor: great , great . so , roy is a 50-year-old male patient who comes in with a history of depression , you had some , um , high blood pressure and some hypertension . so , tell me how have you been doing? patient: sure . so it's been a , a pretty stressful winter and spring . and , uh , we've been onboarding a couple new employees and we have been pretty short-staffed in the meantime .","4307":"doctor: um , any changes in , um , weight gain or anything like that ? patient: probably for the last month or so , we've been hosting some friends over vacation , and on ... you know , at the beach in the summer , so the diet is off the charts .","4308":"doctor: okay . okay . gotcha , gotcha . patient: out the window .","4309":"doctor: out the window . okay . and , um , now i know you've had a history of depression . you're on zoloft , uh , 50 milligrams a day . have you been doing okay with that ? patient: uh , for the most part . again , it's been kind of a challenging year-and-a-half or so .","4310":"doctor: okay . uh , sleeping okay at night ? patient: mm-","4311":"doctor: occasionally ? patient: i , i could use more sleep like everybody .","4312":"doctor: uh , no feelings of , uh , you want to hurt yourself or anybody ? patient: no , no .","4313":"doctor: okay , good , good . and , um , your high blood pressure , um , that's been under relatively good control recently . have you found that ? your blood pressures have been okay ? patient: yes . that's why this is a little concerning to me , because of the , uh , recent , the recent readings .","4314":"doctor: okay , gotcha . gotcha . okay . so , um , if you do n't mind , i'm going to do a quick exam . okay ? patient: sure .","4315":"doctor: okay . so , um , on my physical exam , your lungs are clear . your heart is , is regular . you do have a grade two systolic ejection murmur . we've had that before , so nothing new- patient: mm-hmm .","4316":"doctor: . there . um , and not clinically relevant at all . um , your extremities are normal , no edema . um , you have put on a c- a , a little bit of weight . patient: okay .","4317":"doctor: i want you to get back on that diet . patient: okay .","4318":"doctor: because that's the key . right ? patient: okay .","4319":"doctor: as far as your high blood pressure , not going to change anything there . okay ? we'll just leave you on your lisinopril 5 milligrams a day , that's good . patient: okay .","4320":"doctor: that's also good for your kidneys , so everything , everything good ... is good there . your third problem is your depression . been a rough year . some of that's just normal reactive stuff . so i think we'll just keep you where you are at . not going to change the zoloft . do you need a refill on your zoloft ? patient: uh , actually i do .","4321":"doctor: okay . hey dragon , order a zoloft 50 milligrams daily . we'll get that refilled for you . okay ? so , um , i'd like to see you back in about a month , an- and then in about , uh , three months patient: okay .","4322":"doctor: a1c , if everything's getting back on track . okay ? anything else i can do for you today ? patient: no . that should do it .","4323":"doctor: okay . come with me , we'll get you checked out . hey dragon , finalize the note .","4324":"doctor: hi logan , how are you ? patient: hi . good to see you .","4325":"doctor: it's good to see you as well . so i know the nurse told you about dax . i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you . okay ? patient: sure .","4326":"doctor: so logan is a 57-year-old male , with a past medical history significant for coronary artery bypass grafting , hyperlipidemia , and ocd , who presents with an upper respiratory infection . so , logan , what's going on ? patient: so , uh , about a week ago i started to get a cold . and , in the last two or three days , it seemed to move into my chest .","4327":"doctor: okay . um , and , and are you having any pain in your sinuses ? or , any post nasal drip ? patient: um , i had some post nasal drip for , again , for the beginning of the week . and then , uh , it , it left my , uh , my head . it went right down to my upper , uh , chest .","4328":"doctor: okay . and have you gotten vaccinated against covid ? patient: i actually have . i've , uh , gotten both vaccines .","4329":"doctor: okay . all right . patient: on both , both stages .","4330":"doctor: okay . and anyone else sick as far as you know ? patient: no , not in my house . no .","4331":"doctor: okay . and have you had any fevers ? patient: uh , i thought i had a slight fever , but no .","4332":"doctor: okay . and , um , any shortness of breath ? patient: no .","4333":"doctor: okay . all right . um , so let's just talk a little bit about your high cholesterol . how are you doing with the diet ? patient: i've been pretty good for the most part . uh , we did a little bit of travel over the last week or so , so the diet was n't great . but , for the most part it's been good .","4334":"doctor: okay , i , i know we have you on the , on the crestor 20 milligrams a day . you're doing okay with that , so tolerating it ? no muscle aches , anything like that ? patient: no muscle aches .","4335":"doctor: okay . and i know you had the , uh , bypass grafting last year . you're doing okay ? patient: it's been great .","4336":"doctor: no chest pain ? patient:

so , here it ... your vital signs look great . your oxygenation is 96 % . so that's very good . okay ? uh , i'm just going to check out your heart and lungs , and i'll let you know what i find . okay ? patient: sure .","4341":"doctor: okay . so on exam , you do have some cervical lymphadenopathy . and your lungs have bilateral ronchi in them , um , and some wheezing . so , what that means is , you know , you have a little infection . you probably have a little bit of a cold , and you have some lymph nodes that are swollen , and some congestion in your lungs , like you said . let's go ahead and take a look at some of your results . okay ? patient: mm-hmm .","4342":"doctor: hey dragon , show me the lipid panel . so your cholesterol , for the most part , is really good . i think you're doing a good job . uh , i do n't think you have to make any changes right now . um , hey dragon , show me the covid test . turns out you're positive for ... for covid . so the results of your po- your covid test are positive . patient: okay .","4343":"doctor: so , i know you were vaccinated . you probably have a , a , a very , um , low-level positivity . so let's talk about that . so for your first problem , uh , is your covid infection . and i think the vaccine has helped you . it seems to be very mild at this time . your oxygenation is really good . i want you to quarantine for t- for 10 days , so , uh , try to avoid your other household family members . okay ? patient: okay .","4344":"doctor: and you're going to have to take off work . um , if your symptoms worsen , i want you to call me . patient: okay .","4345":"doctor: it's just supportive management . uh , for your next problem , your high cholesterol , let's continue you on the crestor 20 milligrams a day , and continue to watch your ja- your , your diet and i- then i'll go ahead and order another lipid panel for six months . and , from a coronary artery bypass grafting standpoint , your coronary artery disease seems under control . you're exercising . you do n't have any chest pain . we'll do a stress test in six months as well . patient: okay .","4346":"doctor: okay ? any questions ? patient: no questions

examination of your heart , you know , i do hear that's , like , two out of six systolic ejection murmur , but we've heard that in the past . your lungs sound nice and clear . and on your knee exam , i do appreciate , you know , some bilateral , uh , edema and some slight erythema , there is a slight effusion present on the right knee . does that hurt ? patient: little bit .","4373":"doctor: all

hey , dragon . show me the right knee x-ray . so this is an x-ray of your right knee and in reviewing the results of that , everything looks fine , there's no boney abnormality , there's no fracture , which is not surprising , based on the history , okay ? patient: mm-hmm .","4375":"doctor: hey , dragon . show me the ekg . and this is your most recent ekg which we did before you came in , and that all looks really good . so , um , so no concerns from a heart standpoint . so let's talk a little bit about , you know , my assessment and my plan for you . patient: mm-hmm .","4376":"doctor: so for your first problem , your , your knee pain , you know , i'm concerned that it might be from , you know , a flareup of your lupus , so i wan na go ahead and order and autoimmune panel to kinda see where we stand , okay ? patient: sure .","4377":"doctor: hey , dragon . order an autoimmune panel . for your next problem , the coronary artery disease , i think you're doing really well , your ekg

some re- routine blood work done last week and , uh , they said that my blood sugars were , were high , so that i should come in , um , and talk to you and get some more work done and , and , uh , see why that is .","4386":"doctor: okay . well , were you having any symptoms at all or just , we had some blood work done routinely ? uh , any chest pain , shortness of breath ? any nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea ? patient: no , no symptoms . uh , so i was a little shocked when i came back high and , and elevated , so hopefully we can figure out what's going on .","4387":"doctor: we've been , kind of , checking on this for a while and you've been on metformin . we actually increased your dose last time- patient: yup .","4388":"doctor: so right now you're on 100 , 1,000 milligrams a day ,

hey , dragon , show me the hemoglobin a1c . so in reviewing your , that's the lab that we checked after when i saw before i walked in . it says 8.1 , which is elevated , so i think we need to do a maybe a better job with adjusting your medication . how are you doing with your diet for your diabetes ? patient: my diet's been really great lately . i've been avoiding sugars , um , been really watching , uh , my weight and power walking every day , so i was a little surprised when the , the blood work came back that i- i had , um , an elevated , uh , test .","4391":"doctor: okay . and , uh , have you had any , uh , any other , are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or your fasting blood sugars ? patient: yes , i am .","4392":"doctor: okay . all right . how are you doing with

today . all right . for the first issue , for the diabetes , since your hemoglobin a1c is is elevated , uh , and you're already on 1,000 milligrams of metformin , i think we should add , uh , jardiance , uh , 10 milligrams a day . uh , so that's a new medication . we'll start that . i do want you to , uh follow your diet pretty , uh , aggressively . i wan na see if we can get that hemoglobin a1c down the next time . i'm also gon na add some labs today to see what that , to see a lipid panel and some other blood work . hey , dragon , order a cbc , cmp , and a lipid panel . and

.","4400":"doctor: okay , great . and for the knee , i think you're doing great with that . you know , continue with your physical exercise , with your physical therapy , uh , uh , with your normal

weekends, it even encouraged me to do a little in the yard myself which was a nice way to be active and get some sun. but with the seasons changing and it getting so cold out, i have not been able to keep doing it and need to find something new to do. . i'm not ready yet to try any meds , so i think i'd like to look into some alternative options .","4432":"doctor: okay . so yeah . so we can talk about some therapy and that type of thing . patient: sure .","4433":"doctor: all right . and no ... you do n't wan na harm yourself or others ? patient: no .","4434":"doctor: any thoughts like that . patient: no .","4435":"doctor: no , okay . and then in terms of your diabetes , how are you doing , you know especially with the holidays managing your- your sugar intake and that type of thing ? patient: uh , got through halloween okay . did n't stick to the diet too much through the thanksgiving week but it's a little bit better . so i've been trying to really monitor it .","4436":"doctor: okay . and are you ... you're still taking the metformin , correct ? patient: yes .","4437":"doctor: okay . all right . and then in terms of your high blood pressure , did you buy the blood pressure cuff that i recommended ? patient: yes .","4438":"doctor: okay . and how have they been running . i have n't received any you know notes from you in the portal . patient: nothing out of the ordinary . it's been pretty moderate .","4439":"doctor: it's been pretty good . and you're still taking the lisinopril , no problems with that ? patient: mm-hmm . correct .","4440":"doctor: okay . all right . i know you did a review of system sheet when you checked in . patient: mm-hmm .","4441":"doctor: um , do you have any symptoms . chest pain , shortness of breath , belly pain- patient: no .","4442":"doctor: blood in your stool . patient: no .","4443":"doctor: weight loss . anything like that ? patient: no .","4444":"doctor: okay . all right . i wan na go ahead and do a quick physical exam . patient: mm-hmm .","4445":"doctor: hey dragon . show me the vital signs . so here in the office . i agree . your blood pressure looks good . uh , i think you're doing a good job with that so keep up the good work . i'm gon na go ahead and take a listen to your heart and lungs , i'll let you know what i find . patient: sure .","4446":"doctor: all right . so on physical examination , everything looks pretty good , so on your neck exam , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits . on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base , which we've heard in the past . patient: mm-hmm .","4447":"doctor: your lungs are nice and clear and you do have uh one plus non-pitting edema bilaterally in your lower extremities . so what does all that mean ? it just means i heard a little sound in your heart , which you know is n't anything clinically significant . we had looked into that last year . patient: mm-hmm .","4448":"doctor: you do have a little swelling in your legs but that might just be from your your diet recently , okay . patient: sure .","4449":"doctor: i wan na just take a look at some of your results . hey dragon , show me the ekg . so i just had the nurse do an ekg on you before you came in just to make sure we were n't missing anything . you're in your 60's we have some risk factors . everything looks good . patient: mm-hmm .","4450":"doctor: there's no evidence that i'm concerned about anything at this time . hey dragon , show me the diabetes logs . so on your diabetic labs , your hemoglobin a1c is elevated . it's at eight . i'd like to see it closer to six . now some of them might be having to do with the holidays that type of thing but i still think that we need to get that under better control . patient: sure .","4451":"doctor: so lets talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem of your depression i'd like to just go ahead and refer you to uh psychiatry not for medications , but just for some talk therapy that type of thing , okay ? patient: that's fine .","4452":"doctor: um , for your second problem of your type two diabetes i'd like to go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c in the next couple months . i want to increase the metformin to 1000 milligrams twice a day . and we're gon na go ahead and order a lipid panel , okay . patient: mm-hmm .","4453":"doctor: uh , lastly for your third problem for your hypertension i'm gon na go ahead and order an echocardiogram just to recheck it . just that heart murmur . and i'm going to go ahead and keep the lisinopril at 20 milligrams a day . do you have any questions ? patient: no questions .","4454":"doctor: okay the nurse will be in soon , she'll get you checked out , okay ? patient: you got it .","4455":"doctor: hey dragon , finalize the note .","4456":"doctor: okay . maria martin , date of birth 03\/05\/1946 , has been informed and consents to have this visit recorded . the patient is here for follow-up . hi , maria . how have you been doing ? patient: same i guess . pretty good .","4457":"doctor: okay , so you got my letter last time on the results . your sugars are not very well controlled . patient: yeah , i got them .","4458":"doctor: okay . so did you increase your glimepiride ? patient: did i increase it ?","4459":"doctor: yeah . so we want you to , as the letter said , from the last time , when your a1c was 9.9 , we wanted you to increase it to four milligrams twice a day , so let's start that . patient: okay , sure . so you want me to take two of the pills , now twice a day ?","4460":"doctor: yes . uh , how much of it do you have ? patient: well , i just filled it .","4461":"doctor: okay , good . so yeah , you can take two of them twice a day , of what you have . the new prescription will be for four milligrams twice a day . patient: okay .","4462":"doctor: great . and are you trying to eat healthier : less sugars , less carbohydrates ? patient: uh , well ...","4463":"doctor: not really ? patient: . well , i have n't had any pasta ; i just do n't really like it , so we do n't have any in the house . we do n't often have bread , and if we do , we buy wheat bread .","4464":"doctor: okay . but even the wheat bread , try to cut down on the number of slices you eat per day . patient: i just usually have two in the morning . i do n't care for sandwiches much ; maybe peanut butter sandwiches once in a while .","4465":"doctor: well , that's great . patient: i drink club soda .","4466":"doctor: okay , that's fine . how about your eye exams ? are they up-to-date ? patient: yep . i just got new glasses .","4467":"doctor: okay . who do you go see ? patient: i go to liberty road , the group up there .","4468":"doctor: okay . the , um

for my eyes .","4472":"doctor: cataracts , yep , okay . patient: so he did that and then i had to wait for a month to get healed up and then he wrote my prescription .","4473":"doctor: perfect . and then you've got the high blood pressure . patient: yeah . a couple of weeks ago , it was 116 on the dot .","4474":"doctor: okay . well , we will recheck it . you're on a combination of medications . you are on the met- met- uh , metoprolol , 50 milligrams once a day , you're on the lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide , at 20 , with 25 milligrams once a day , and you're on the amlodipine , 10 milligram once a day . are you taking all of those ? patient: well , yeah .","4475":"doctor: perfect . and then you've got the high cholesterol and the vascular disease in your legs . you're on atorvastatin . are you tolerating it okay ? patient: yeah , but honestly , my feet feel like hell .","4476":"doctor: okay . yeah , the feet i think is what we call peripheral neuropathy . patient: also , i have the pain up to my hip .","4477":"doctor: okay . you have pain in the hips and upper legs ? patient: yeah , all of it .","4478":"doctor: okay . so those do seem relatively stable , right ? and are you trying to get the walking in ? patient: yeah .","4479":"doctor: okay . and you are smoking still ? patient: yeah , still smoking .","4480":"doctor: not ready to quit ? patient: no , not really .","4481":"doctor: it's a bad combination . patient: i know . i'll think about it .","4482":"doctor: okay . now , let's do my review of systems . you're not having any headaches or dizziness ? patient: headaches or dizziness , no .","4483":"doctor: good , good . and the vision is better with the cataract surgery ? that's been good ? patient: yeah . not happy with this lens ; it's kinda funny . the other one is good .","4484":"doctor: hmm , sometimes they can go in and clean up the eye with laser , but we'll see what they say . patient: okay .","4485":"doctor: okay . no shortness of breath or coughing ? patient: i've been coughing here lately because i've been congested .","4486":"doctor: what does it look like when it comes up ? patient: it's relatively clear .","4487":"doctor: no fever , chills , no shortness of breath ? patient: no .","4488":"doctor: okay . no chest pains or pressure or tightness ? patient: no .","4489":"doctor: nausea , vomiting , gi symptoms ? patient: no .","4490":"doctor: okay . peeing okay ? patient: not good . it's , you know , i'm old ; it takes me a little more time .","4491":"doctor: slower stream but stable ? patient: yes , but i do pee ...","4492":"doctor: mm-hmm . how many times do you have to get up at night ? patient: not too bad , just once in a while .","4493":"doctor: okay . all right , let's have a look at you . patient: okay .","4494":"doctor: physical exam : carotids are normal , pulse is no buits . heart exam : rhythm is regular , normal rate , s1 and s2 are crisp . i do not hear any murmurs today , okay . have you lean forward for me . take some deep breaths , in and out . okay , lungs are clear . i do n't hear any rasps or wheezing today . patient: my coughing got better this morning .","4495":"doctor: you cleared out the lungs ? all right , let me take a look at your feet . patient: okay .","4496":"doctor: okay . extremities are without edema . pulses are palpable on the dorsalis pedis posterial tibial . she has thickened nails . patient: yeah .","4497":"doctor: yeah . mildly dry skin , no skin breakdown . l- let me know if you can feel this . patient: okay . i closed my eyes . yeah , yeah , okay .","4498":"doctor: mildly decreased sensation in the tips of the first and second toes . okay , we're done with your exam . patient: okay .","4499":"doctor: okay . so again , try to keep the feet moisturized . patient: yeah .","4500":"doctor: you do have a little bit of periphe- peripheral neuropathy . um , there is a medication we can use if they get really bad , but you're already on so many medications . patient: my girl that i talk to and stuff , she uses on her feet ; she really likes it . it's , like , a foot scrub or some type of cream . i put it on when i think of it after the shower . so i could get my own instead .","4501":"doctor: that sounds good . so for now , your sugars , we're gon na check your ... we're going to recheck your blood work today , but the sugars last time we checked , the a1c , your blood sugar average was above nine . i really want you to increase the glimepiride . so the ones you have at home , the two milligram , take two of them twice a day . patient: okay .","4502":"doctor: okay . watch for low sugars , weak , shaky , sweaty . if that happens , let us know , and i do n't expect it to . patient: okay .","4503":"doctor: okay . the new prescription that i'm going to write is gon na be for the , uh , four milligram pill . so when you get the new one , just one pill twice a day . also , continue the metformin , okay ? blood pressure , when i rechecked it , i got 140 over 60 s- so the numbers at home are better , so we're gon na continue the combination of medications . we'll check kidney function today . for your cholesterol though , you're on the high dose of atorvastatin or lipitor to protect the arteries , so we really wan na keep you on that . patient: yeah , no problem .","4504":"doctor: i want you to quit smoking , but we've had this battle before . patient: yeah .","4505":"doctor: hmm . and then , we will leave everything else the same . we'll get the labs today and we'll see you back here in four months . sound good ? patient: okay .","4506":"doctor: great . have a good day , ma'am . take care of yourself . patient: thank you . you too .","4507":"doctor: patient mrn : abc123 . date of birth : january 1st , 1960 . patient is a 60 year old , right-handed male , referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling . hello , mr. cook . how are you doing this morning ? patient: hi , dr. martinez . this weekend was a bit rough . i've had this numbness and tingling for a few weeks now .","4508":"doctor: so it's in both of your hands ? patient: yes , ever since my car wreck last december when i broke them ... well , once they healed , i mean , i noticed it more , the tingling and the numbness .","4509":"doctor: and you still wear the splint only on the right wrist ? patient: no , i also wear the left sometimes . the right is just worse , but the splint helps . both have really gotten worse over the last month . when i broke them , my right wrist was definitely in worse shape . i've also been having some s- mild stiffness in my neck too . i hit my head during the accident , and they told me it was a contusion .","4510":"doctor: and where would you say the tingling and numbness is ? patient: on this side , it goes from here and here up to about here . on the other side , it's from here to here .","4511":"doctor: i see . so on the right side , you're pointing from the middle and ring finger , all the way up the forearm . and on the left , the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger . and is there any pain or just tingling and numbness ? patient: eh , it's mainly just sore . sometimes they throb , but overall , they feel weaker too , especially when i'm using them . the tingling happens more when they hurt , but when it goes away , the tingling is dull .","4512":"doctor: and when do you feel these symptoms ? patient: well , really , i guess , just more so at night , and they come and go throughout the day .","4513":"doctor: okay . and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ? patient: like , feeling something ? no , not that i can really think of . though , in general , they may be less sensitive than they should be , but i can still feel . they also gave me some nerve pain medicine , but i have n't been taking it like i should .","4514":"doctor: and are you still on the coreg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety ? patient: yes , i'm still taking those . i had prediabetes too , but i got it under control by changing my diet .","4515":"doctor: and no history of thyroid issues , correct ? patient: nope .","4516":"doctor: all right , thank you , mr. cook . okay , first , we'll go over your review of systems . correct me if i'm wrong in any of this . constitutional , you have fatigue and weight gain ; gi , you have excessive appetite and bloating ; eyes have floaters ; cardiovascular shows shortness of breath and leg swelling ; endocrine , you're always hungry ; skin , you have some nail bed changes , dryness , itching ; musculoskeletal , you have gout and muscle pain . and the remainder of the review of systems is negative . patient: yep , that's all correct .","4517":"doctor: all right , we're going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination . let's look at the right hand first . can you feel this ? patient: yeah , but a little less on these two fingers .","4518":"doctor: sensation is normal , except pin prick sensation diminished in third and fourth fingers on the right . and how about on the left ? patient: um , yeah , but these two a little less .","4519":"doctor: sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left okay , let's test your reflexes now . reflexes are 1+ and symmetric ; 2+ knees ; toes are downgoing bilaterally . all right , i'm going to tap on your right wrist . do you feel anything ? patient: yeah , it feels like a zing up my wrist and something into my elbow too .","4520":"doctor: and how about the left side ? patient: yeah , same on that side too .","4521":"doctor: tinel sign positive at both wrists and both elbows . rest of exam is normal . all right , so what i am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or , potentially , this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome . however , your symptom presentation suggests car- bilateral carpal syndrome , as the nerve in your wrists are aggravated by your past trauma . this is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me . patient: okay , so how do we make it better ?","4522":"doctor: first , i want to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from . we'll need to schedule you for a nerve test , which is called an emg test . they will measure the responsiveness of your nerves to truly pinpoint where you are having your issues . patient: that sounds fine to me .","4523":"doctor: great . after the tests are complete , you can return here for a follow-up visit . if you're still having symptoms , we can consider a referral to our hand clinic , possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release se- surgery . you could also refer ... we could also refer you to an orthopedist for the same treatment . patient: sounds good , doc .","4524":"doctor: all right , keep wearing your splints , and i will see you after those studies . patient: thank you .","4525":"doctor: patient shirley taylor . date of birth 5\/4\/1961 .

one also sometimes . the right one's just worse . the splint seems to help . both have gotten worse over the last month . when i broke them though , my wrist was definitely in worse shape than it is today . i've been having some mild stiffness in my neck too . i hit my head during the accident , and they told me it was a contusion .","4528":"doctor: okay . and where exactly on the right side would you say the tingling and numbness is ? patient: on the right , i can really notice it from my middle and ring finger all the way up to my forearm , and on my left , a bit more the pinky and the ring and not the middle .","4529":"doctor: all right . and , um , is there is pain or , or just tingling and numbness ? patient: uh , mainly just sore . sometimes they throb , but overall , they feel weaker too , especially when i'm using them . the tingling happens some more , but when they hurt , you know , it goes away and then the tingling's just dull .","4530":"doctor: what kind of activities ? patient: well , really , i guess , just more so at night , and then it just kind of comes and goes throughout the day .","4531":"doctor: okay . and do you experience any loss of sensation in your

me some nerve pain medicine , but i have n't been taking it like i should be .","4532":"doctor: okay . looks like your medical history is notable for chronic kidney disease , gout , hypertension , anxiety , gerd , and diabetes . patient: well , i had pre-diabetes , but i got in under control changing my diet .","4533":"doctor: okay . good . and are you still on the carvedilol 25 milligrams two times a day for hypertension and lexapro 10 milligrams a day for anxiety ? looks like your allergic to sulfa drugs as well . is that correct ? patient: yeah , i'm still taking those and sulfa just causes me to break out in a rash .","4534":"doctor: and no history of thyroid issues , right ? patient: nope .","4535":"doctor: all right . thank you ms. taylor . i'll be right back for your exam . i want to look up that medication you mentioned for your nerve pain . patient: all right . thanks .","4536":"doctor: review of systems , please make the following changes . uh , constitutional , patient

, he referred me here .","4540":"doctor: okay . can you tell me more about it ? patient: yeah . though i mean i ... right now , i take 40 milligrams of omeprazole twice a day . some days , it is fine , but others are just really bad .","4541":"doctor: what do you feel ? patient: it feels like burning .","4542":"doctor: in your chest ? patient: yes , in my chest and also in my throat .","4543":"doctor: in your throat and chest . all right . any difficulty with swallowing ? feels like food or liquids kinda get stuck ? patient: no .","4544":"doctor: okay . that's good . any abdominal pain ? patient: no , not really .","4545":"doctor: nausea or vomiting , changes in bowel movements ? patient: no .","4546":"doctor: constipation , diarrhea , rectal bleeding ? patient: nope .","4547":"doctor: okay . very good . and how long have you had this problem ? patient: i've had acid reflux since i was around 12 , but it has gotten worse over the past few years .","4548":"doctor: okay . and how long have you been on the omeprazole ? patient: on the way , it is now i think about a year .","4549":"doctor: okay . do you find that it's done anything for you in the past ? patient: i mean , i can tell it's helped because some days , i'll be fine , and then some days , i eat something and it feels terrible .","4550":"doctor: are there any things that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint , like food choices or stress ? patient: sure . probably stress and food choices sometimes .","4551":"doctor: okay . what things bother you ? patient: spicy foods , um , so i try not to eat them too often , but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it .","4552":"doctor: we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that , even sodas . um , even just the carbonation can cause that . how about tomato-based products or citrus products ? patient: yeah , sometimes , but i still eat them .","4553":"doctor: okay . it's reassuring that you are n't having any difficulty swallowing , though . how's your weight been ? pretty stable ? patient: i'd say pretty stable , although i have n't had much of an appetite for the past two months . i have been under a lot of work stress .","4554":"doctor: what do you do for work ? patient: i'm a paralegal .","4555":"doctor: okay . and any family history of gi issues ? patient: um , my grandmother had esophageal cancer .","4556":"doctor: on your mom or dad's side ? patient: mom's side . and my mom had some issues like acid reflux , and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach .","4557":"doctor: okay . have you ever had an upper endoscopy ? patient: i think maybe when i was younger .","4558":"doctor: but not in the last 10 years ? patient: no .","4559":"doctor: have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole ? patient: um , at one point i was on omeprazole and ranititine -dine . it did help . but other than that , those are the only medications i have taken .","4560":"doctor: okay . have a seat here , and let me listen to your heart and lungs , and then we can talk about a plan for you . patient: okay .","4561":"doctor: so normal physical exam per my new patient template , except for well-healed abdominal surgical scars noted . what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from ? patient: i always forget about that surgery . i had it when i was a baby . my mom said my intestines were twisted , so i had to have surgery when i was around one month old .","4562":"doctor: hm , gotcha . okay . so let's talk about what you have going on . from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several-year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux . and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole , 40 milligrams twice daily . you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ? patient: yes .","4563":"doctor: and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated bev- beverages , citrus , and tomato-based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet . so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd , even though you're taking the ppi . patient: okay , yeah , i could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods .","4564":"doctor: great . so stress is another trigger that we need to address . high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms . patient: yeah , stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me .","4565":"doctor: so working on that may help with your gerd . additionally , we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole . if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium . patient: that's fine with me . i'm definitely open to trying whatever .","4566":"doctor: perfect . i will send a prescription for nexium 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file . i'll also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd , or upper endoscopy , to look for potential causes of the gerd . we'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth , down your throat , through your stomach , and end in the small intestines . we'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything . patient: okay . can i schedule that today ?","4567":"doctor: yeah . you can get scheduled at checkout desk . i'll have you follow up with me in the office for the egd so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary , stress , and medication changes . how does all of that sound ? patient: that sounds good .","4568":"doctor: perfect . i will walk you to the checkout desk . be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes or if you have problems before your egd and follow-up appointment . please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan . i suspect that she likely has gerd with underlying functional etiology as well . reassuringly , she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia . if her egd is normal and her symptoms pers- persist despite a trial of nexium , we can consider a trial of protonix and obtain a ph-impedance study . this will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity .","4569":"doctor: . next patient is michelle king . date of birth : 05\/07\/1982 . please use toc template . she was admitted to district regional hospital on 06\/29\/2021 , and was

going on . patient: it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .","4572":"doctor: okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high . patient: so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?","4573":"doctor: typically , it does n't . patient: okay .","4574":"doctor: but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive . patient: yeah , that's what they said .","4575":"doctor: and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ... patient: hm .","4576":"doctor: but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed . patient: yeah .","4577":"doctor: uh , they did n't do a ct scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ? patient: yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .","4578":"doctor: mm-hmm . patient: it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .","4579":"doctor: yeah , it was good that you went in . patient: so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .","4580":"doctor: well , maybe that's all it was . patient: yeah .","4581":"doctor: so you're doing good otherwise ? patient: yes , i am .","4582":"doctor: good . let me take a quick listen to you . patient: okay .","4583":"doctor: all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ? patient: nope .","4584":"doctor: great . so here are my thoughts . patient: okay .","4585":"doctor: you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ? patient: yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .","4586":"doctor: okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues . patient: mm-hmm .","4587":"doctor: i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while . patient: okay .","4588":"doctor: and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ? patient: sure , i can do that .","4589":"doctor: great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol . patient: okay .","4590":"doctor: and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels . patient: mm-hmm .","4591":"doctor: i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see . patient: i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .","4592":"doctor: have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing . patient: is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?","4593":"doctor: got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works . patient: yeah .","4594":"doctor: all right . so we have our plan . any questions ? patient: yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .","4595":"doctor: sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ? patient: i am unvaccinated .","4596":"doctor: so what are your concerns about the vaccine ? patient: well , we do n't know the side effects .","4597":"doctor: correct , we do n't . patient: it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as \" vaccine injury \" .","4598":"doctor: right . patient: which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.","4599":"doctor: well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you . patient: okay .","4600":"doctor: and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay . patient: yeah .","4601":"doctor: but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid . patient: mm-hmm .","4602":"doctor: i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that . patient: all of them ?","4603":"doctor: yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ? patient: no , i do n't .","4604":"doctor: right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint . patient: well , i am open-minded to this .","4605":"doctor: mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated . patient: okay .","4606":"doctor: so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country . patient: mm-hmm .","4607":"doctor: the er is full of these vaccines . patient: i understand .","4608":"doctor: so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion . patient: well , that's what i'm here for .","4609":"doctor: yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly . patient: okay .","4610":"doctor: so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency . patient: sure .","4611":"doctor: but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ? patient: will do .","4612":"doctor: all right . anything else we can discuss today ? patient: nope . i think i'm all set . thank you .","4613":"doctor: you're welcome . so we'll see you in two to three weeks . have a good rest of your day . patient: thanks , you too .","4614":"doctor: next line heading will be \" acute to chronic constipation \" . she believes her hospitalization was more likely due to her dysreflexia , from her quadriplegia that typically occurs . she did have a lot of vital signs changes , including blood pressure fluctuations . the patient feels like she has a good bowel regimen , including taking the miralax regularly as a primary treatment for constipation issues as well as lactulose for severe constipation . she feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection and was just related to her constipation . however , we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis . i would recommend just in the next three or four weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs , and we'll repeat the cbc just to make sure her white blood cells tend downward . uh , next line and heading will be \" quadriplegia \" . um , next line and heading will be \" covid vaccine status \" . again , she's hesitant . we had a good discussion , and i recommended that the only true preventative mechanism for covid is the vaccine . i do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off . i would be concerned if she does n't get the vaccine and i would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status . she does not want to get covid . however , she needs to make these decisions . she is somewhat homeopathic .","4615":"doctor: all right . this is matthew rogers . date of birth 5\/24\/2007 . i would like to use the acne follow-up template for him . he is here today for an acne follow-up . at the last visit on 3\/3\/21 he was prescribed the following : clindamycin lotion , uh , trent- tretinoin cream , 4-5 % benzoyl peroxide wash for f-face and 5-10 % for chest and back . so we're going to enter the room : hi there , how are y'all today ? patient: good , how are you ?","4616":"doctor: i'm good , thank you . uh , acne doing better ? patient: yeah .","4617":"doctor: excellence , excellent . tell me , uh , what did you do for your skin this morning ? patient: i washed it with , uh , the benzoyl peroxide and i put the antibiotic thing , and the sunscreen moisture stuff as well .","4618":"doctor: perfect . uh , what did you do last night ? patient: uh , i washed my face with the benzol peroxide , i put , uh , the tret-tret-tretinoin cream , sh-uh sorry i do n't know how to say that , uh , for nighttime and the sunscreen moisture stuff again .","4619":"doctor: all right , all right , now have you had any redness , peeling , dryness , or irritation with the use of these medications at all ? patient: nope . not at all .","4620":"doctor: excellent , excellent . and , uh , washing your chest and back with the higher strength benzoyl peroxide wash , is that right ? patient: uh , no . i did n't get it .","4621":"doctor: okay . um , are your chest and back doing okay ? patient: um , i mean , i have n't put much effort into it because it has n't' really bothered me .","4622":"doctor: fair enough . that's all right . um , if it bothers you , that's what , uh , that's why i recommended last time patient: okay .","4623":"doctor: um , so as we move into the summer it may be something that you are more interested in pursuing doing that , uh , but if you feel like the acne on your face ... do you feel like the acne on your face is improving ? patient: yeah . definitely .","4624":"doctor: all right , good . good . uh , go ahead and bring your mask down . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . that looks good ! patient: yeah . it's okay .","4625":"doctor: definitely . uh , this is one of the fun parts of covid for me . it's like the mask comes down for my acne patients and it's like a big reveal . this lo- this looks a lot better , like a lot better . uh , i'm just going to take a look at your back and chest real quick . um , i would n't recommend making any changes to what you're doing . uh , i'm happy with how things are going . are you- are you happy with how things are going ? patient: yeah .","4626":"doctor: all right , yeah . if that little bit bothers you , i would use a 5-10 % benzoyl peroxide base . i think that ... i think that what i have using on your face is a 4-5 % . um , usually the back and chest can handle a little , uh , a little something stronger . um , that's the only thing i would think about changing , otherwise it think this looks great . patient: sounds good .","4627":"doctor: all right , uh , do you have any questions for me ? patient: um , i do n't . i'm just going to write that down .","4628":"doctor: uh , well you want me to write that down for you on your , uh , checkout sheet ? patient: uh , yeah . that'd be awesome .","4629":"doctor: uh , the one i recommend for the chest and back is the , the PanOxyl 10 % . uh , we actually have samples of it and coupons . so i can send you home with those . patient: cool . that'd be perfect .","4630":"doctor: all right , um , so i'm going ahead and tee up a one year prescription for you because at this point i'll want to see you once a year . i want to make sure that you have enough of your medicines , um , and these are going to walgreens on broad ? patient: uh , yeah .","4631":"doctor: okay . um , all right . so the tretinoin , uh , usually lasts patients a couple of months . you probably have n't refilled that , right ? patient: uh , yeah , we did once , i think .","4632":"doctor: okay . okay . so i'm going to go ahead and send in a new refill for the clindamycin with 11 refills . and then the tretinoin cream with three refills . uh , that's usually about enough for a year . uh , if you run out though , just let us know . i'm happy to send more . uh , i just need to see you back once a year for your medicine . all right ? your acne printout with steps will be at your checkout sheet . and then here are your samples and coupons . patient: alrighty , thank you .","4633":"doctor: um , as far as the physical exam . scattered inflammatory papules and pustules across the upper back and posterior shoulders . there are less than 5 inflammatory papules on the forehead , cheeks , and chin . acne vulgaris is improved and well controlled on the face , but there is a mild flare on the back . recommend continuing current treatment plan for the face and initiation treatment with PanOxyl 10 % foaming wash to the back in the shower daily .","4634":"doctor: stephanie morales , medical record number 113322 . 44-year-old female that presents today six weeks status post right medial unicompartmental arthroplasty . hello !

problems ? patient: no , no problems , uh , just still the numbness on this side .","4638":"doctor: okay . that area of numbness will get smaller as the nerves that innervate the skin across the knee heal . patient: right . okay .","4639":"doctor: so lem me take a look at your right knee . patient: sure .","4640":"doctor: all right , and relax for me . good . all right , and bend . good . that looks good . um , the incision looks nice . patient: mm-hmm .","4641":"doctor: let's look at your x-rays . uh , they look good . so here's what you got going on in there . uh , it looks good . everything's lined up nicely . um , that's looking at it from the front . and this is looking at it from the side . and then this was underneath your kneecap , but we did n't do anything there . but things looks great . patient: okay . i'm so happy with how the surgery went . i have no pain .","4642":"doctor: yeah , you know , you're still early in your recovery , so i expect you to get even better than what you are now . um , so keep doing your pt to work on your strength , range of motion , and endurance . patient: okay , will do .","4643":"doctor: you're probably still gon na have aches and pains occasionally . i usually tell people it's two or three months before you feel like you're back to yourself again , so you're doing really well . patient: okay . that's really good to know . thank you .","4644":"doctor: yeah , let's plan to talk again in six weeks . so if you stop at the desk on your way out today , they're going to get you set up for a telemedicine visit . and that visit'll just be to check in and see how you're doing and make sure things are progressing okay . patient: sure , okay . and can i ask you about work before i go ?","4645":"doctor: okay . i , i do n't want you lifting greater than five or 10 pounds , and no standing or sitting longer than a half an hour . uh , usually that means you ca n't do a ups job . patient: all right . so would you write a note to excuse me for another six weeks ?","4646":"doctor: sure . i'll have my nurse anna give it to you . patient: that's great . thank you .","4647":"doctor: okay , so we'll talk again in six weeks , and we can discuss your job again at that time . patient: sounds good .","4648":"doctor: yeah , those , um , are the types of , of jobs that take a good three months until you're kind of ready to get back to doing that kind of labor-intensive work . patient: okay , and driving now ?","4649":"doctor: uh , we have plenty of data that says normal reflex time is returned at six weeks , and then your return to driving is determined by when you're ready and feel safe to be driving . patient: okay .","4650":"doctor: yeah . so hang tight . anna will bring that note back in to you , and we'll talk in six weeks . patient: all right , that sounds good .","4651":"doctor: uh , but keep working hard on , on pt in the meantime though . patient: i definitely will . thank you .","4652":"doctor: all right , have a good rest of your day . patient: you as well .","4653":"doctor: okay , this is a six-week post-op meeting exam for her . her gait was antalgic with a slight limp and decreased velocity . she's not using an assistive device . right knee focused exam has a healed surgical scar , mild swelling , tenderness- tenderness . . on the area of the incision . range of motion is zero to 120 degrees . everything else normal . radiographs were three views of the right knee taken today and show implants in stable position . no evidence of loosening or early complications . thanks .","4654":"doctor: okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12\/27\/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ? patient: i'm doing okay . how are you .","4655":"doctor: i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad . patient: yes , that's correct .","4656":"doctor: great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ? patient: yeah , that sounds good .","4657":"doctor: okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today . patient_guest: sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .","4658":"doctor: sure . that makes a lot of sense . patient_guest: we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .","4659":"doctor: goodness . okay . then what happened ? patient_guest: yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .","4660":"doctor: okay . patient_guest: um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .","4661":"doctor: wow . okay . patient_guest: uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .","4662":"doctor: all right-y . then- then what happened ? patient_guest: yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .","4663":"doctor: okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ? patient_guest: yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .","4664":"doctor: okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel . patient_guest: thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .","4665":"doctor: mhm . okay . patient_guest: yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .","4666":"doctor: all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ? patient_guest: she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .","4667":"doctor: got you . okay . patient_guest: so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .","4668":"doctor: hmm . okay . patient_guest: yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .","4669":"doctor: yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ? patient_guest: only pepcid .","4670":"doctor: okay . patient_guest: yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .","4671":"doctor: all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ? patient_guest: no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .","4672":"doctor: great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ? patient_guest: yes . my mom had breast cancer too .","4673":"doctor: okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ? patient_guest: yes , that is correct . he did .","4674":"doctor: okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ? patient_guest: yes , and they did n't catch it in time .","4675":"doctor: i'm so sorry to hear that . patient_guest: yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .","4676":"doctor: my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care . patient_guest: you're welcome .","4677":"doctor: okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ? patient_guest: yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .","4678":"doctor: okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned . patient_guest: um , this is what she sent me , \" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . \" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .","4679":"doctor: okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ? patient_guest: correct . yep .","4680":"doctor: all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did . patient_guest: yes .","4681":"doctor: okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ? patient: i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .","4682":"doctor: okay . and any pain when you go pee ? patient: sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .","4683":"doctor: okay . and any blood in your pee ? patient: no , not that i've noticed .","4684":"doctor: okay . patient_guest: she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .","4685":"doctor: okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um- patient_guest: okay .","4686":"doctor: all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented . patient_guest: okay .","4687":"doctor: all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ? patient: okay .","4688":"doctor: good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee . patient_guest: okay .","4689":"doctor: or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today . patient_guest: okay . thank you .","4690":"doctor: i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead . patient_guest: okay . that sounds good .","4691":"doctor: okay . and does ashley play any sports ? patient_guest: yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .","4692":"doctor: how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water . patient_guest: okay . great . we will work on that .","4693":"doctor: okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses . patient_guest: we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well .","4694":"doctor: good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't

range of motion so that's good any pain down your legs patient: no","4727":"doctor: great no nerve pain alright so we took an x-ray when you came in it looks like you do n't have any fractures or anything on the spinal bone that's good you can see where you had surgery it looks like everything has healed properly there so that's good news so what i think you did is you have a a muscle pull there from having a misalignment in your spine so what i'm gon na do is i'll prescribe some physical therapy for you you have great physical therapy here at the va so you can just come right to our physical therapist and that should help have you have you been there before patient: yes","4728":"doctor: how do you feel about it patient: i really go to the dentist","4729":"doctor: got it okay so i'm also gon na prescribe you some meloxicam instead of the ibuprofen that might help a little bit more with some of the pain management patient: is there any chance i can get some vicodin","4730":"doctor: lem me check your record quick for for pain management it's kind of a strong drug for vicodin and we do n't really like to prescribe that unless it's totally necessary so why do n't we start with the meloxicam and i also write a referral to pain management and they can talk to you a little bit about some of your pain and maybe not using narcotics to manage it patient: how about some demerol","4731":"doctor: hmmm sure i'll prescribe demerol patient: thank you","4732":"doctor: yeah you're welcome any other problems going on today you want to talk about patient:

yes","4737":"doctor: okay so what's going on patient: sorry to put you off i do n't think i have that script","4738":"doctor: macular degeneration yeah yeah i was because we do n't we do n't to do the intro anymore i was just going with that you you're coming in with sudden visual distortion and blurring of vision so i'll just you know i'll just say i'll just go ahead and go into this technician part so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines and your door frames have been looking crooked to you is that right patient: it is yes","4739":"doctor: okay what kind of venture are we gon na go into do you do you have the the script or no it it just talks patient: but it's it's not presenting like like how you're reading it like how you're talking about it is it kinda what i'm saying because like after that i'm supposed to say yeah whenever i take my husband out to like a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights but i'm not really getting the question of like so what's causing it or where do you have this happening stuff like that so i'm a little confused","4740":"doctor: okay i mean i can just straight out follow the script just so we can kinda get it rolling so so i said so hi so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines in your door frames have been looking crooked to you patient: yeah and whenever i take my husband out to a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights","4741":"doctor: uh okay so do you have a favorite restaurant you like to go to patient: i do mcdonalds is one of my favorite here in arlington","4742":"doctor: that sounds good what what do you what's your favorite there patient: they have a great egg plant parmajon one of my favorite so i just go ahead and go with that","4743":"doctor: that sounds really nice very good patient: it's just","4744":"doctor: yeah okay well so it looks like you're still smoking a pack of cigarettes a day patient: yes i tried to stop smoking every now and then but it's still been hard to totally stop","4745":"doctor: okay and how is your blood pressure been doing are you keeping up with your medication patient: i take my blood pressure when i can remember to do so","4746":"doctor: okay yeah it's really important to keep up with your blood pressure check that regularly i'm totally going off script and you know might want to keep a log of that as well and check your blood pressures regularly so okay well let me do a just a quick exam of your eyes if you can take off your glasses and just rest your chin on the chin rest okay so the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes right eye the cornea is clear no mvi pciol cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees without any tears or holes or pe changes in the fovea posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula thickening of the retina presence of subretinal fluid and exudates accumulation positive for hemorrhage left eye the cornea is clear no mvi cup to disc is . three or pe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage or subretinal fluid retina is attached okay so i reviewed the results of your diagnostic tests so for the oct so it shows drusen deposit and the retinal pigment epithelium subretinal fluid accumulation choroidal neovascular membrane can be visualized fluorescein angiography reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration so the diagnostic tests and the eye exam are really indicative of neovascular age related macular degeneration so this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss and it really happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina and they will leak fluid and blood and hints the name wet amd and can create a large blind spot in the center of the visual field and this is really with the most common cause for severe loss of vision so my plan is to give you an injection of lucentes once a month it's injected into the vitreous portion of the eye after it's been numbed and injections are given regularly over a period of time it may slow the rate of vision decline or stop further vision loss but however the disease and loss it may also progress despite treatment do you have any questions patient: i do not no that sounds great","4747":"doctor: hi jaqueline how are you i heard that you injured your ankle patient: yeah it's not going so great","4748":"doctor: what what happened to your ankle patient: well i was doing something i did n't really want to be doing and i fell and now my

hits","4771":"doctor: you've had a fever how high was your fever patient: like two hundred","4772":"doctor: that's not a fever alright okay so lem me go ahead you looking at your vital signs you do n't have a fever now your temperature is ninety eight . six your blood pressure is fine at one eighteen over seventy seven and your heart rate looks good at seventy seven beats per minute on your right ankle exam there is some edema and erythema on the lateral malleolus on the right hand side there is associated ecchymosis and a few excoriations does it hurt when i press on it patient: yes","4773":"doctor: there is pain to palpation of the right lateral malleolus there is decreased flexion and extension of the right ankle as well as internal and external rotation there is no apparent injury to the knee or the foot okay so what does that mean jacqueline seem awfully giggling right now so what does that mean so i took a i had the nurse do an x-ray on you before i came in and reviewing the results of your right ankle x-ray shows that you have no acute fracture or bony abnormality which is good you just have a some soft tissue injury so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so for patient: really","4774":"doctor: yeah so for your assessment and plan i do believe you have a an acute right ankle sprain i wan na go ahead and put you in an air cast we can give you some crutches i wan na go ahead and prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day you should ice the area for about twenty minutes five times a day and weight-bear as tolerated i am anticipating you to start feeling better in the next couple of weeks if you're not come back here and see me and we will consider physical therapy or pursuing further imaging okay patient: okay bye","4775":"doctor: hi betty how are you i i read in the medical records that you ended you did end up having a heart attack they ended up putting a stent in your right coronary artery how are you doing patient: i'm thankful to be alive but definitely struggling and definitely scary time for me","4776":"doctor: yeah you know i'm i'm i'm glad that we went ahead and sent you to the emergency room now i know that you were in the hospital for about forty eight hours how are you feeling since you've been home you've been home a couple of weeks now how are you doing patient: yeah they told me to really take it easy so i've just been you know doing very light work i i i do n't really do much outside of just you know sitting around and taking my medication but i would say i'm doing okay i feel like i have you know a little it i do n't feel perfect but i feel better than you know i did","4777":"doctor: okay and have you had any more of that chest pain since they put that stent in or is that completely gone patient: i have not had any chest pain since no a little you know sore right after surgery but that doing much better now","4778":"doctor: okay and i know that they went through your wrist for the cardiac catheterization how is your wrist doing patient: it's good i you know it was red for a while but it seems to be healing and i think there is no infection","4779":"doctor: okay and you're right handed correct patient: correct yes right handed","4780":"doctor: okay alright and any shortness of breath when you walk around or move anything like that patient: yeah i i would say you know i've been trying to keep my my i i'm not doing a lot of exercise but i will say that when i go up and downstairs you know i do feel like i have shortness of breath","4781":"doctor: okay now i know they put you on that medication the brilinta are you you're taking it correct patient: yes i take it twice a day every twelve hours","4782":"doctor: okay great and you're still taking your aspirin correct patient: i take the baby aspirin at night is that okay","4783":"doctor: yeah that's perfect as long as you take it once a day and you're able to afford the brilinta any issues with cost with that patient: no i so far so good","4784":"doctor: okay alright so it's really gon na be really important for you to go ahead and continue to take these medications to prevent that stent from clogging again okay or prevent that stent from closing because we do n't want you to have another heart attack okay patient: okay yeah","4785":"doctor: okay and how about watching your diet are you able to watch your salt intake i know that you really liked a good pizza every now and again are you patient: yeah i i have eaten pizza a few times what i'm trying to do is really be diligent and eat well throughout the week and then i have had pizza a few times on the weekends is that okay","4786":"doctor: you can have a piece here and there you know the pumping function of your heart was pretty normal when i saw from the hospital your ejection fraction that's the pumping function of your heart was at about fifty percent which is you know low normal but not bad so that's good so okay just i would just watch your salt intake okay patient: okay yeah i've been eating a lot of vegetables and and chicken without salt on it","4787":"doctor: okay great and then you know i i'm i'm glad that you're taking it easy now remind me this might cause you some anxiety were the denver denver nuggets swept or did they end up winning are they still in the nba playoffs i forget i know that you are a denver nuggets fan patient: i am yeah they they are not sweep they were down three games but they wanted the last one so there is a there is a chance for it come back but they they play again tomorrow","4788":"doctor: okay yeah i'm a self expand and and we just swept the brooklyn net so i was really excited about that patient: congrats that that's that's always good to sweep the nuts no one no one likes them","4789":"doctor: no one likes them okay well let's i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your blood pressure here in the office your blood pressure looks good it's about one twenty seven over sixty which is pretty good on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention there is no carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally and on your musculoskeletal exam your right radial artery cardiac cath site is clean dry and intact there is no hematoma and there is a palpable radial pulse now what does that mean betty so all of that means is that you know you have a little bit of a heart murmur after having the heart attack but i looked on the echocardiogram and it showed that you know you do have mild mitral regurgitation which is just you know a little floppy valve which is is fine we'll just keep an eye on that and then everything else for the most part looks good so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of your inferior myocardial myocardial infarction i wan na go ahead and continue with your aspirin continue on your brilinta you're gon na stay on the brilinta for at least one year and aspirin you're gon na take lifelong until i tell you to okay i wan na go ahead and have you continue on the crestor forty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and put in another echocardiogram for about six months okay do you have any questions about that patient: yeah do you think i can no that sounds good i have one other more question though","4790":"doctor: yeah so at this point you're you know you're out like two weeks and your and your cath site is looks good so you can go ahead and and resume swimming now with that being said i would want you to just do a few laps here and there i do want to enroll you into cardiac rehab that's gon na give you a bit more confidence to go back to exercising and they also give a lot of dietary education and counseling in cardiac rehab does that sounds like something that you can do patient: yeah i think i have to","4791":"doctor: okay i agree alright i also want you to go ahead and continue with your toprol fifty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and order a some liver function studies and a lipid panel to follow up with the next time we meet and i want to see you again in probably six weeks okay patient: okay","4792":"doctor: okay any questions patient: no i think that's it thank you very much","4793":"doctor: okay take care bye","4794":"doctor: and good morning hi beverly patient: good morning","4795":"doctor: how do you see your last name patient: howard","4796":"doctor: howard nice to meet you patient: you

happen patient: maybe like two weeks ago","4799":"doctor: okay and which knee are we talking about patient: my right knee","4800":"doctor: alright and tell me exactly what happened patient: so we were like riding together and i think he said he saw a squirrel or something like that he's a little distractible and you know like he went down so i went down i hit it on the curb like it's really kinda it was sore i gave i i took some ibuprofen and i i like washed it out and put a band-aid on it but it's it's just been like kind of hurting everyday since then so i scheduled an appointment","4801":"doctor: okay is it getting better getting worse or just kinda lingering on patient: it's it's just holding on and i tried taking like medication right i took some ibuprofen and it was fine it just like it keeps coming back and i i read on the label i'm not supposed to take that stuff for more than two weeks right","4802":"doctor: well it all it all depends everyone's different we'll get to that patient: okay","4803":"doctor: and your knee was not bothering you at all before this normal knee patient: yep","4804":"doctor: never okay alright what do you do for living patient:

dog","4806":"doctor: okay have you broke up with him already or patient: no i did n't know that knee injury was a reason to but now that you've told me maybe we should talk about that","4807":"doctor: we'll talk about that later too patient: okay","4808":"doctor: alright so let's take a let's take a peek at your knee here patient: okay","4809":"doctor: you gon na stick it through the screen or how you're gon na do this alright patient: okay","4810":"doctor: alright then i'm just i'm gon na i'm gon na grab your leg we're just gon na take it through just let it relax i'm just gon na take it through a little range of motion i'm gon na kinda poke around all different places you tell me where it hurts okay patient: okay okay","4811":"doctor: alright now i'm poking i'm poking i'm poking so on the inside part here is this where it hurts patient: yeah like when you touch it it really hurts","4812":"doctor: right there okay tell me what's worse here or here patient: on the inside","4813":"doctor: okay so medial joint line tenderness patient: mm-hmm","4814":"doctor: pes bursa nontender epicondyle nontender back of her knee nice and soft any pain back here patient: no i do n't think so","4815":"doctor: okay popliteal space is nontender how about over on this side patient: no","4816":"doctor: okay lateral side nontender skin she has got about a dime size little abrasions dry looks about a week week old right over the medial patella everything else looks good no scars okay how about can you straighten it out all the way patient: i can but sometimes it like hurts a little bit like it almost like it clicks","4817":"doctor: yep that's good though full full extension how far can you bend it patient: all the way back","4818":"doctor: okay let's see patient: okay","4819":"doctor: good good and how about the other side let me see the left knee can you bend that one all the way back too patient: yeah that's fine","4820":"doctor: okay full full symmetric flexion no no deformities go ahead and just let it relax patient: mm-hmm","4821":"doctor: valgus stress medial collateral ligament intact lateral collateral ligament intact okay so little kind of little laxity posterior drawer let me see the other let me see the other knee patient: mm-hmm","4822":"doctor: yeah so that that feels pretty much normal so she's got a about a one plus posterior drawer anterior drawer negative lachman negative good let's go ahead and just kinda bend and straighten for me patient: okay","4823":"doctor: good patellar patella tracks fine no crepitus alright let's go back to this medial side you're tender right there is that right patient: yeah","4824":"doctor: it's tender on the medial joint line but actually negative mcmurray negative lateral side negative mcmurray good so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts patient: yeah sometimes","4825":"doctor: what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like patient: walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts","4826":"doctor: yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it patient: hmmm","4827":"doctor: you actually no patient: yeah it hurts no","4828":"doctor: what about you i mean are you real weak patient: no i would say i'm pretty strong","4829":"doctor: did you go to the gym patient: i go to the gym but i swim so the","4830":"doctor: okay i ca n't treat people like you you you you need to work harder patient: i quit complaining okay","4831":"doctor: yes sir work harder patient: okay","4832":"doctor: do you do you play sports in in college or high school patient: i did in high school","4833":"doctor: yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids patient: no","4834":"doctor: just kinda you're thinking walking the dog patient: yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim","4835":"doctor: on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee patient: no no i have n't would you recommend that","4836":"doctor: well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off patient: okay","4837":"doctor: it's pretty bad patient: okay","4838":"doctor: we'll get we'll get to that too patient: okay","4839":"doctor: so did you already have x-rays of this knee today patient: yes","4840":"doctor: okay do i go into that to patient: yeah","4841":"doctor: look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it patient: you're only cup of this","4842":"doctor: let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like patient: hmmm","4843":"doctor: i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery patient: mm-hmm","4844":"doctor: but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament patient: okay","4845":"doctor: does that make sense patient: yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen","4846":"doctor: yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here patient: okay","4847":"doctor: so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier patient: mm-hmm","4848":"doctor: so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses patient: okay","4849":"doctor: okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner patient: mm-hmm","4850":"doctor: we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we

them","4881":"doctor: you do n't check them okay so yeah we can get a a glucose test today and and and just check those because that's something we want to do everyday you know just to make sure you're eating the correct amount and that your sugars are are in range to make sure that and also to make sure that our medication is is the right amount as well so we'll do that that glucose test at the end of your visit and we could see if we can adjust your medication or not so let's go ahead and do a physical exam on you so i just want to double check make sure are you having any chest pain patient: yeah yeah yeah on and off so it kinda comes with the elbow pain arm pain","4882":"doctor: okay comes with elbow pain arm pain patient: chest pain","4883":"doctor: chest pain patient: it kinda goes up my neck sometimes too","4884":"doctor: up your neck alright patient: yeah it's that whole side it just aches comes and goes","4885":"doctor: comes and goes alright how often is that chest pain

patient: no","4888":"doctor: no okay just the chest pain alright patient: yeah","4889":"doctor: so i'm gon na listen to your heart here and it it does seem like i do hear a slight murmur with your heart here and i i do n't think we've we've heard that before so i think i'm gon na get an ekg as well because i'm concerned you might be having like a mild heart attack so because you have the pain all the way up your elbow that go into your neck and your your chest pain as well i do n't think it's it's it's musculoskeletal pain because you said you had n't done anything with it so far so what i wan na do is and let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan here so i i do think that you or you do have that chest pain i'm concerned that you know you might be having a mild heart attack i'm gon na get ekg for that we're also gon na get you some aspirin is a nitroglycerin just to see if that helps with that pain as far as your for your diabetes i want you we're gon na get that p oct glucose and we'll keep you on be five hundred of metformin for now and then for your hypertension we'll keep you on that two . five of of norvasc but i think our most immediate issue is the is the chest pain and so we'll do the ekg and depending upon those results we'll we'll call nine one one because we really need to get you to the hospital if that is the case so how does that sound patient: i do n't know i was talking to my brother and he's a he is a heart doctor and he kinda thought maybe it was n't the heart but","4890":"doctor: i did n't hear about that no patient: yeah he he he yeah

ability did not stop pooping probably had a diarrhea i'm not sure i did n't hear about that but most of the time patient: no it could it could stop pooping rushing","4893":"doctor: could not poop and you said pooping patient: yeah i know","4894":"doctor: it could n't stop pooping yeah i mean that that might cause like anxiety or something like that you know we ca n't stop pooten he's he's he's in charge of my united states but right now i'm i'm really you know me i'm concerned about your heart so i do wan na get the ekg just to make sure you know it'll be would n't be good if we did n't get that you know in the case that you you leave here something terrible happened and and i would n't want that to happen on my watch so patient: right","4895":"doctor: we'll definitely get those tests

and how bad would you say the pain is like it's a zero to ten on a scale today patient: yeah it it waxes and wanes in severity it it's in general probably around a four or a five but sometimes it gets up as high as a seven or eight","4901":"doctor: okay is there anything that you notice that makes that pain worse or better like rest or movement or eating or anything else patient: it's usually a little worse after a meal","4902":"doctor: hmmm okay patient: in the morning before i've eaten it's it's not too bad but during the day after a meal it gets worse","4903":"doctor: okay alright and do you notice that pain radiates anywhere or moves you know any or anywhere patient: it's pretty low it might radiate a little bit to the left but otherwise it's pretty localized to the right side","4904":"doctor: okay and have you had any nausea or vomiting along with the pain patient: i've had some nausea and a little bit of heartburn but no vomiting","4905":"doctor: okay and and this is this is this is worse with you said worse worse with meals and is there anything else anything else that that makes it worse patient: it is a little tender if i if i press on it and certain positions seem to make it a little worse when i'm most when it's the highest","4906":"doctor: okay sure any pain with urination or any blood in your urine patient: no no urinary symptoms","4907":"doctor: okay and how about any diarrhea and any of that or blood in your stool no patient: no change in bowels","4908":"doctor: okay alright and so would you say that your appetite has been normal or decreased or any different patient: well since i'm a little nauseated i'm not quite as hungry and i feel just kind of a little overall a little more fatigued over the last week","4909":"doctor: okay okay you did n't overeat you know during the super bowl last weekend did you that was i know probably lots of junk food floating around if your house is anything like mine patient: well once the packers are out of the playoffs i do n't watch the super bowl so nothing i have n't eaten anything unusual","4910":"doctor: okay well that's good that's good and and no no travel i know you're a big big travel travel fan you know i remember you telling me about your trip to europe last summer that sounded amazing have you been traveling outside of the country again recently patient: not recently just back to wisconsin but no unusual travel or other exposures","4911":"doctor: okay alright great and okay so so tell me about your migraines how have they been are you still taking the sumatriptan you know as needed when when you developed migraine you have have you had a migraine recently patient: i have not usually they are responsive to just excedrin migraine i use the sumatriptan when i need to if it if it does n't respond to the over the counter analgesic","4912":"doctor: okay okay great yeah you've learned a lot about it and and the treatments including the the term analgesic and all of that that's pretty impressive you've been you've been through the ringer i think with with those so okay and so you're taking excedrin when you get a migraine and then sort of would you say maybe for breakthrough migraines or worse migraines you'd take a sumatriptan occasionally patient: yeah","4913":"doctor: okay got it and how about your blood pressure how has that been running at home are you checking your blood pressures daily still and how how your how how have your blood pressures been patient: i have not been checking them daily i i probably check it about two or three times a week","4914":"doctor: okay okay not not too bad it does look like you're a little bit elevated today i i maybe i'm just making you nervous though so i hope not so are you but you're still on lisinopril twenty milligrams per day correct it looks like you might be running low do you need a refill of that patient: yeah actually i was going to ask you about that if i could get a refill that would be great","4915":"doctor: sure we can do that and so okay but you are still taking that twenty milligrams per day correct patient: correct","4916":"doctor: okay and alright fair enough so so let's go ahead and and examine you now karen so on your physical exam pretty normal and and unremarkable for the most part on your on your heart exam i do hear that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that you've still got that's unchanged from prior exam that just means i hear some heart sounds you know as i'm listening to your heart there i'm not too concerned about that we'll watch that otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and then your your abdominal exam gastrointestinal exam you have some tenderness in the right upper quadrant i would say mild to moderate tenderness and now if you take a deep breath does that and i press here does that hurt you patient: yes","4917":"doctor: okay yeah you have i would call an equivocal murphy's sign in the right upper quadrant on your abdominal examination as well the rest of your abdomen is soft and no significant tenderness you have no tenderness in the right lower quadrant with deep palpation and you have no cva tenderness on your back exam as well and so we will talk about about that i am a little bit concerned about the tenderness that that i find on your abdominal exam the remainder of your exam karen is pretty normal and unremarkable and and so that's good let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan so first of all for your first problem of abdominal pain you you do seem to have acute abdominal pain with right upper quadrant tenderness that i'm concerned maybe a sign of some gallstones or possibly even an infection in your gallbladder so i'm gon na order some blood tests and an ultrasound today i'm gon na order a cbc chem twelve urinalysis a pregnancy test and also right upper quadrant ultrasound and so we will we will get those tests done right away i'm gon na keep you here we'll see how those look fortunately we've got the facilities for those and if we need to send you to the emergency department based on those results we will i do n't want you to eat anything right now okay in case we find something that might require surgery alright unlikely but it's possible and then okay you know karen i meant to ask you on your history one thing by chance have you had a fever along with this abdominal pain patient: i've had some chills but no documented fevers","4918":"doctor: okay alright alright good yeah i i see you do n't have a fever today so that's that's good and so alright now for your second problem the migraine headaches you you do have a history of chronic migraines and and you have occasional bouts of of migraines nothing recent so let's continue the excedrin as needed over the counter for treatment there and then also the sumatriptan as needed for breakthrough migraine pain and i i would just encourage you to continue to avoid alcohol binges and caffeine binges and try to get enough sleep and all of that's easier said than done i know so but but that seems to be helping you now for your third problem of hypertension your blood pressure seems to be under adequate control so that's good we'll continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams per day and i will write you a refill prescription for that and send that to the pharmacy please continue to check your blood pressures daily so karen how does that all sound for a plan any other questions for me patient: i actually do need a refill on my sumatriptan as well","4919":"doctor: okay alright sure yeah no problem so for your migraines the migraine problem i'm also gon na write you that that refill prescription for sumatriptan and anything else you can think of patient: no the plan sounds good","4920":"doctor: alright sounds good we'll see you back in about four weeks or so and actually i am gon na follow up on your results today before i let you go but i'll check on those and and we'll we'll see how how you do and and hopefully be able to get you home today so we'll go from there i'll i'll see you shortly patient: thank you","4921":"doctor: good alright hello hannah how are

history of any seasonal allergies patient: right around spring time i get a little bit of sneezing and the runny runny nose","4930":"doctor: okay okay and then any how about any body aches for you patient: no body aches","4931":"doctor: nausea or vomiting patient: no","4932":"doctor: okay alright so we will definitely examine you and talk more about that and as far as your diabetes how has

everyday","4937":"doctor: okay and how about your diet how's been thing as far as salty foods patient: i've been trying to stay away from the salty foods but sugar intake i'm having a little bit of trouble with that","4938":"doctor: okay okay but it seems like you've been making good progress and that could be difficult sometimes and you mentioned being around i think you said your sister a few days ago or a family member patient: yeah she was just kinda sick with similar symptoms and i noticed i started to developed a little bit of a cough right after","4939":"doctor: after that okay and how is your family doing how is everyone doing other than that other than being sick for your sister how is everyone going patient: everyone's doing great","4940":"doctor: okay and for you too were you on vacation last week and a lot of people had vacation last week patient: yes i was on vacation last week actually","4941":"doctor: okay hopefully you were n't sick for too much of it patient: no i was feeling okay","4942":"doctor: okay okay patient: got back and started feeling poorly","4943":"doctor: sorry about that alright so what i'm gon na do now is i'm gon na go ahead and start your physical exam i looking at your vitals vitals look overall pretty good i do see your blood pressure is elevated at here it's one forty four over seventy two otherwise everything else looks good so let's check you out so first starting i'm just gon na check start with your sinuses and when i press here do you have any pain any tenderness when i do that patient: no","4944":"doctor: no okay so no frontal sinus tenderness how about when i press on the on your cheeks here patient: maybe a little bit just a little bit","4945":"doctor: on both sides patient: yes","4946":"doctor: okay so bilateral maxillary sinus tenderness alright and i'm just gon na take a look at in your mouth if you can open up okay so i do see some do have some erythema of the pharynx and the tonsils are symmetrical i do n't appreciate any exudates now i'm just checking your neck and i do appreciate some anterior cervical adenopathy alright and i'm just gon na take a listen to you alright so listening to your heart so you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and you do still have that two out of six systolic ejection murmur at the left base now i'm taking listen to your lungs and on your lungs exam okay your lungs are nice and clear i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales or rhonchi alright and just looking at your lower extremities i do n't appreciate any edema there so let's talk about my assessment and plan so for your first problem of the cough so looking at your cough it does seem like you have a upper respiratory infection and so basically that's a virus most likely it's a virus that's causing your symptoms especially being around someone else who has similar symptoms and seems like most likely they spread it to you so i want you to continue with doing a lot of the time is just letting the virus run it's course and taking things just to help with your symptoms so drinking lots of fluids that's gon na help you trying i know you've been doing a cough medicine you can even try another one you have to be careful with the blood pressure and diabetes so you can try like a coricidin hbp can help with the cough and lots of rest okay lots of rest now we are in a current pandemic and so something i can check for you if you're okay with that is checking for covid if that's okay with you patient: yes i'm okay with that","4947":"doctor: okay so we will check you for that today and see how you're doing with that and then we will give you those results okay any questions about that patient: no questions","4948":"doctor: no okay so for problem number two the type two diabetes so we'll continue you on your metformin five hundred milligrams daily or twice a day you had blood work at your last visit so you'll be due at your next visit for your hemoglobin a1c and that's the check the sugars on your red blood cells so we do that about every three months so at your next visit we'll check that for you and then we will go from there but it seems like you're doing well with that now as far as problem number three your high blood pressure so your blood pressure is elevated here and it sounds like it's been you know creeping up just a little bit at home as well you're on a very tiny dose of the hydrochlorothiazide so what i would like to do is increase it to twenty five milligrams once a day again i would recommend that you take it in the morning just because you may have noticed it can make you urinate quite a bit and then i would love for you to just continue checking as you have been a few times a week just checking your blood pressure at different times of the day so we can continue to see how you do with that okay patient: okay alright that sounds","4949":"doctor: alright any questions for me patient: no questions","4950":"doctor: thank you alright so at this point now i'm just gon na press the i'm gon na","4951":"doctor: hey betty how're you patient: i'm doing okay aside from this left shoulder pain that i've been having for a few weeks now","4952":"doctor: wow well i'm sorry to hear that do you remember what you were doing when the pain started patient: i you know i ca n't think about anything specifically but i am very active and i also have been renovating my basement so i have been doing a lot with that","4953":"doctor: wow okay and do you know if there was any direct or associated trauma that you can think of over the past three weeks like did you fall or hit your shoulder or anything patient: no no trauma that i can think of at all","4954":"doctor: okay now have you ever had pain in that shoulder before patient: you know i'm active and will have aches and pains here and there but nothing that some tylenol ca n't take care of","4955":"doctor: okay and and it's isolated to your left shoulder patient: it is","4956":"doctor: okay are you able to move that left arm for me patient: you know anytime i try reaching for something or lifting anything i have a lot of pain and i do n't even try to raise my arm over my head because that's it it really hurts","4957":"doctor: okay so now i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain are you having pain all of the time or does it wax and wane does it come and go patient: it's all the time and if there is any pressure like when i try to sleep at night i ca n't even lay i'm a side sleeper and it i really gives me a hard time because i'm so uncomfortable so the pain is always there","4958":"doctor: okay so you ca n't lay on your left side at all patient: i ca n't","4959":"doctor: alright now do you have that pain when you lay on your back as well or just on your left side patient: i mean it's always there but when i sleep directly on it the pain goes up","4960":"doctor: okay now let's talk just briefly about your pain so if you have n't taken anything at all or have you been taking anything at all let's start with that have you been taking anything for the pain patient: yeah i've been taking tylenol and i'll take two extra strengths tylenol every six to eight hours","4961":"doctor: okay that's good now without any tylenol what's your pain level patient: without any tylenol i would say my pain is like a three","4962":"doctor: okay and then with tylenol with that patient: i'm sorry i keep doing that without any tylenol my pain is like a seven and with tylenol it goes down to a two or three","4963":"doctor: okay that's good so the tylenol really does help you that that's a good thing patient: yeah","4964":"doctor: so you talked about renovating your basement did you guys just move in or is it just time for a little house facelift patient: yeah it just time we've been living in this house for some time now and you know with the pandemic we've been home and so decided to do some work","4965":"doctor: nice have you been into the new home depot that they just opened down the street here patient: no","4966":"doctor: yeah it's nice my wife and i were there this weekend and they just opened two weeks ago so everything's fully stocked and if you guys are doing some renovations you might run down there and you know save big money at home depot patient: i definitely will check that out","4967":"doctor: so are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your arm or hand patient: no","4968":"doctor: okay so if you do n't mind i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam i've reviewed your vitals everything looks good there and i'm gon na do a focused exam of your left shoulder now you have limited active and passive range of motion there is some tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus and there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or clavicular joints and you have good hand grip bilaterally neurovascular exam of your left arm your cap refill is brisk in less than three seconds and motor and sensation is intact to light touch now for review of your x-ray of that left shoulder the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality so let me talk to you briefly about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy this means that the tendons of the muscles of that left shoulder have been injured and the injury happened to the tendons that make up or attach to the shoulder muscles i'm gon na go ahead and order an mri of your shoulder just to make sure nothing else is going on with that left shoulder i'm also going to go ahead and refer you for physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks okay now during that time i want you to continue to take tylenol p.r.n . if your symptoms do n't improve we can then consider maybe like a steroid injection of that left shoulder which could hopefully get you some relief now do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan patient: yeah so i'm really active so do you think that this pain will ever go away","4969":"doctor: i do i do believe that that pain is gon na go away many of my patients are successful with pt so we are gon na start with that take a conservative approach and see how you do patient: okay alright","4970":"doctor: alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you some paperwork and i'll see you in about two about two weeks patient: alright thank you","4971":"doctor: thank you","4972":"doctor: hey matthew how is it going good to see you today i see here in your notes you are here for some

norvasc so are you taking that daily patient: yes","4985":"doctor: yes great i i i'm so happy when my patients are compliant most of the times they do n't take it as as often but i'm i'm really excited for that what have your blood pressures been running i think today patient: you're about one forty over eighty it's a little bit high but i know we we talked about you getting a blood pressure cuff at home and taking those so i do n't check it very often","4986":"doctor: i mean it's it's not the best right it's it's we should be around one twenty over eighty right patient: okay","4987":"doctor: you're a little bit elevated and we could talk about changing your medications to try to get that that down how about your diet how's that going patient: i eat anything i want","4988":"doctor: alright well we we definitely got ta got ta get your your diet a little bit better i know after the pandemic a lot of people you know went crazy with the diet myself included but i know we got ta get you get back in because for your diabetes i'm looking at your a1c and we we checked it and it was a a seven point two which is not so good right now so have you been taking i think you're on metformin five hundred milligrams daily patient: i do but i got ta take it sometimes it upsets my stomach and so i just kinda skip it","4989":"doctor: okay so yeah we definitely got ta get you to to take it we could try something else just if you're having interaction with that medication what about your blood sugars are they taking those daily patient: no every once in a while","4990":"doctor: every once in a while what have they been doing every once in a while when when you do take them patient: probably about a hundred and fifty or so","4991":"doctor: okay so we got to get those down too so we will talk about getting you consult nutrition just try to get you a better diet i think you know we wan na get you off the medications totally but you know we got ta get you on the right track here alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you i'm gon na check your your your lungs lungs sound good check your heart so listen to your heart you still do have that grade two out of systolic ejection murmur alright but we we knew about that already you've had that for a couple of years so i'm not really worried about that at this at this time so let me take a look at your knee here so when i press right here on the inside the right knee is that painful patient: ow","4992":"doctor: ow alright and let me have you bend it straighten it it's painful patient: a little yes","4993":"doctor: a little bit alright i'm gon na do a couple of maneuvers here so your your right knee exam shows that you do have pain to palpation of the medial aspect of that right knee also have some edema some little bit of swelling some ecchymosis as well you do have a negative varus and valgus test of my maneuvers and you know i i do see a little bit of of swelling swelling little redness as well in that knee so we did get an x-ray of your knee your right knee luckily it was normal so there's no fractures no bony abnormalities which is good so you did n't break anything so based on my your based on your x-ray and your exam you have a mcl tear well mcl strain i apologize mcl is straight i do n't know if you have a tear yet we got ta do yeah we had to have to do a mri for that but basically means you twisted your knee when you're playing basketball right and so that ligament is strained or torn just to have to get an mri to determine if it is or not in the time being i want you to continue to take that tylenol just to help with that pain i'm also gon na prescribe you some meloxicam fifteen milligrams just to help with the pain and swelling i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer and i want you to stay off of that for the next couple of weeks and we're gon na get a mri as well for that knee how does that sound patient: that's okay","4994":"doctor: alright for your diabetes i'm going to need you we got to get you to start taking your your blood sugars daily we got to keep track of those alright so i want you to take those daily we'll get a log book so you can keep track of those and bring those back and we can determine how we adjust your medications for now also i'm going to give you a consult to nutrition to try to get your diet a little bit better and then for your hypertension i'm gon na up your medication up up up up your norvasta five milligrams because your blood pressure is a little bit high and hopefully we can a medication adjustment will lower it down to that one twenty over eighty like we like we made alright so i'm going to see you back in two weeks do you have any other questions patient: yes so i heard strawberries can lower your blood pressures are you truth to that","4995":"doctor: you know i i have n't i have n't heard that before you know patient: you know i know it's normally they say like the the pumice granite seeds or antioxidants and and such but the strawberries i i have n't heard you can try it if you want actually no i i do n't want you to eat too many strawberries because a lot of sugar in your in your","4996":"doctor: your diabetes is n't going so low right now so stay away from the strawberries because that's a lot of sugar you'll need that patient: sure","4997":"doctor: alright so any other questions patient: i i think i'm okay right now","4998":"doctor: alright so my nurse will be in with that appointment and we will see you in two weeks","4999":"doctor: mister thompson is a 67 -year-old male with a history of essential hypertension hyperlipidemia and osteoarthritis who is here today with elevated and fluctuating blood pressures so hi there mister thompson it's nice to see you again listen i understand you're having some trouble with your blood pressure control i would like to discuss that with you but first i want to ask you i'd like to use this app this new fancy app that's gon na help me focus on you a bit more in our conversation would that be okay with you patient: yes that's fine","5000":"doctor: okay great it's gon na record our conversation okay perfect so jerry tell me mister thompson tell me about your blood pressure readings recently i understand you're concerned about them they have been up they have been down what's going on and any other symptoms patient: normally my blood pressure has been very well controlled over about the last three to four weeks there have been periods where i felt a little lightheaded slight headache and when i checked my blood pressure the upper number has been occasionally over one eighty which is way past you know what any of the numbers have been in the past","5001":"doctor: okay okay and okay and yeah that does sound unusual for you and so it's been high but you've also felt lightheaded at times have you checked your blood pressure when you were feeling lightheaded was it was it low at those times or have you done that patient: i've done it both when i felt fine and then when i had the lightheaded episodes actually it's been on the high side","5002":"doctor: okay alright understood and you have n't passed out or anything have you patient: not recently","5003":"doctor: okay and have you had any chest pain or trouble breathing along with you know your elevated blood pressure patient: sometimes a little heaviness in my chest but no no nothing sustained and i do n't have any respiratory or breathing difficulty","5004":"doctor: okay excellent and how about any headaches or other neurologic symptoms like numbness or weakness or you know balance instability or anything like that patient: little unsteady when i get the dizziness and a slight headache when the blood pressure numbers have been a little higher","5005":"doctor: okay and when you say dizzy are you feeling lightheaded like you might pass out or you feeling that the world spinning around you or what patient: just a little fuzzy where you just feel more lightheaded","5006":"doctor: okay alright understood and you've not had any any fever or nausea vomiting anything like that have you or diarrhea patient: no","5007":"doctor: okay and are you feeling any palpitations or your heart racing anything unusual there patient: not usually no","5008":"doctor: okay and are you still taking the lisinopril twenty milligrams once per day no actually i see we last visit we increased that to twice per day you're still taking that lisinopril twenty milligrams twice per day patient: yes i am","5009":"doctor: okay you are not missing doses or anything are you by chance patient: very rarely","5010":"doctor: okay great great you're still using that pill box that we suggested i think you had a pretty good system going there maybe maybe you're using that app now to take to keep track of one when to take your medicine are you doing that patient: yes yeah i've i've used the pillbox and then tried the app it was a little confusing but i'm i'm pretty much on on track with staying on my medication schedule pretty accurately","5011":"doctor: that's great i think i think i remember you saying it was tricky to get that app set up but then your grandson helped you with it and those kids amazing what they can do these days right anything like that i always trust them my kids before me so hey by the way how did he do in his softball or in his in his little league tournament last month i think you said he had a big tournament coming up how did that go patient: they they did great they they got all the way to the finals and then the team that the team that beat them was probably a little older a little bit more season but they had a great time","5012":"doctor: wow wow how fun that's fantastic well congrats good stuff alright well listen so so you're still taking your your lisinopril how about for your hyperlipidemia your your high cholesterol there are you still taking that atorvastatin patient: yes","5013":"doctor: okay excellent and your osteoarthritis i know you've been you know a golfer in the past and you know you wan na get out on the course and things is that still under control are you able to get out and and and walk the full course and things still patient: most of the time you know there are times when the weather changes that i have to maybe play less play less or or skip a day","5014":"doctor: yeah yeah but you're still okay well you're still able to get out and then you're kinda taking i think you're taking some tylenol for for you know mild mild pain and changing your activity as needed is that right patient: correct","5015":"doctor: okay alright good good okay well listen let's go ahead and examine you here jerry so on your physical exam for the most part it's pretty normal and unremarkable on your heart exam you still have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior and just means yeah i'm hearing some heart sounds from the valves that's that's not surprising and i'm not concerned about it we're just watching that one otherwise on your your lung exam you have some mild bibasilar rales but no wheezes or rhonchi and excellent air movement and you have trace lower extremity edema on your extremity exam there bilaterally and otherwise really pretty normal exam so let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan alright so first of all for your first problem of your elevated blood pressure i do think your blood pressure is a little bit out of control meaning we need to make some adjustments i'm going to actually increase your your lisinopril to sixty milligrams twice per day and i'm also going to add twenty five milligrams per day of hydrochlorothiazide and that should help even things out i want you to check your blood pressure measurements twice a day for me for the next two weeks then let's see you back in two weeks and we'll we'll check on how you're doing and also for your second problem of hyperlipidemia i i wan na keep you on the atorvastatin i'm also going to send couple of blood tests i'm gon na send a cholesterol panel also a cbc with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel and we'll check a urinalysis as well look and see how your kidneys are doing there as well and so we'll continue the current management with your atorvastatin there for your hyperlipidemia now for your third problem osteoarthritis i want you to continue to stay active as best you can do n't over do it but walking and you know getting out golfing when you can that's great you can take tylenol for the pain if you have some mild some mild pain there and yeah otherwise i think that cover it i think the adjustments in your blood pressure medicine should help and i wan na see you back in four weeks no let's make two weeks in follow-up and otherwise any questions for me how does that sound patient: i do n't think so anything that i need to do when the weather warms up as far as you know my fluids drinking liquids and things","5016":"doctor: yeah you know be sure you're staying well hydrated you know six to eight glasses of water per day is a good good idea and you you know when when it warms up you're certainly gon na prespire more and lose lose more fluid so so i would i would recommend that you continue to have you know a a standard six to eight glasses of of fluid intake per day but yeah that you know that should do it and if you're feeling particularly dehydrated you might wan na increase that if you have an increased activity level so alright any other questions for me patient: how much beer should i drink","5017":"doctor: probably not the best thing with you know with with with your high blood pressure fluctuating the way it is so not more than a couple drinks a week hate to tell you patient: okay","5018":"doctor: alright okay great seeing you we'll see you back see you in a couple of weeks you take care","5019":"doctor: so donna is a 37 -year-old female she is here with complaint of headache she has a history of hypertension and diabetes so donna tell me what's going on patient: yeah lately i've just been having quite a bit of a headache and i mean every now and then i'll get it but lately it's just been getting worse and i've noticed that my blood pressure has been running high i've been taking it maybe like once a week but the past three weeks it's been really high than usual so i was a little worried","5020":"doctor: do you remember the numbers that you're getting on your blood pressure readings patient: yeah so one of them was like one sixty over eighty seven and then the last one was like one seventy five over ninety two","5021":"doctor: okay so it's really high i was looking back and it looks like your blood pressure was pretty normal last time we saw you is one twenty four over eighty two have you been able to take your blood pressure medicine the lisinopril that you've been prescribed patient: i have but sometimes i forget i'm i'm embarrassed to tell you that but yeah sometimes i forget i get busy like especially on the weekends i'm very good during the week but on the weekends i tend to forget it and that's when i'm most busy too","5022":"doctor: yeah well i'm also curious you know you have diabetes have you been checking your blood sugar patient: yeah i have because i thought maybe you know that's why i'm getting the headaches maybe my sugar was too low or maybe too high but my sugar has been okay it's been running like one twenty sometimes it does get down to like one hundred","5023":"doctor: okay and have you noticed are you urinating more than usual or anything like that patient: not really so much it's it's been pretty much the same but pretty normal","5024":"doctor: okay and when you get these headaches what are you taking for them patient: well i take my tylenol hoping it'll just you know go away and then it does some just for a little bit but then it it just goes throughout the day and i start to get them again","5025":"doctor: okay and when you first had the headaches what would you rate the headache at zero no pain ten the worst pain ever patient: i would say when i first get them it's about i would say a seven out of ten","5026":"doctor: and then after you take the tylenol what does it go down to patient: it goes down to probably about a four maybe five it i still feel it i still feel annoying but it's not as pounding as as it normally would be","5027":"doctor: yeah and have you ever had headaches like this before patient: not like this you know you know as you know sometimes i get migraine but i know i never really take anything for it that's like once a year or once or every two years but not like not like this one headaches like this one","5028":"doctor: okay and have you had any congestion anything like that cough runny nose patient: yeah i thought maybe because you know now it's springtime and i tend to get my allergies but it it's it's very different and i've not actually had any like runny nose or cough or congestion along with the headache","5029":"doctor: okay if you tap on your forehead do you have any tenderness patient: right here","5030":"doctor: okay if you tap down here on these bones your cheek bones any tenderness there patient: a little bit not as much as i guess if i tap up here","5031":"doctor: okay and then if you kinda push on your neck around here any tenderness patient: it it's a little tender but it's not it is a little bit i'd say","5032":"doctor: okay okay so you do n't have any frontal sinus tenderness no maxillary sinus tenderness it sounds like you do n't have any lymphadenopathy that would just be if your lymph nodes were tender so yeah you know let's just talk about a few things that i wan na do and then i want you to actually come in and and be seen by doctor ruth so first off your headache i think taking tylenol is great you can keep taking that you know your lisinopril you're on twenty milligrams once a day which is a medium dose but i think we can increase that so for your hypertension and your headaches i'm gon na have you increase your lisinopril to forty milligrams once a day patient: okay","5033":"doctor: and then i want you to keep checking your blood pressure and i wan na order some blood tests i'd like to get some just normal blood work we'll get a hemoglobin a1c some laboratory tests things like that and and then for your diabetes i'm gon na have some diabetic education for you that i want you to be able to review it sounds like your blood sugar has been running a little bit high and after you get the blood tests after that's all done i want you to come in to see me or doctor ruth and we'll just make sure that everything is okay that we get your blood pressure under control any questions for me patient: no i mean i've been walking and i know i get the headaches but is it alright if i still continue my walks","5034":"doctor: yeah that's great i think exercise is wonderful for everything going on go ahead and walk still patient: okay great we'll do that thank you","5035":"doctor: you're welcome thanks so much donna","5036":"doctor: okay michael so

especially like that like was it sharp could you tell me what kind of pain it was patient: well yeah some days it was sharp some days it was n't some days it moves some days it does n't but it's mostly on the left","5039":"doctor: alright patient: yeah","5040":"doctor: unloving the spectrum that we have right here let's see if we can dig down and get some details well a couple of things i wan na ask have you been a bit more tired than lately patient: no not recall","5041":"doctor: alright how about your appetite are you hungry or or not as hungry patient: i i would say about his that that's pretty much unchanged","5042":"doctor: okay your appetite is unchanged alright what about your water consumption patient: that i'm sorry what did you say","5043":"doctor: no it's fine how about your water consumption patient: yes but i've been drinking a lot more water and i do realize that i i wake up sometimes during the night to you know use the restroom to pee more than i normally

often","5045":"doctor: okay and are you like watching any other sports like did you watch march madness patient: no sorry","5046":"doctor: be still my heart okay that's fine i'll forgive you so

gotten good grades","5048":"doctor: they usually do anybody who chooses to engage in physics for the rest of their life i question their choices it's fine okay but are you when you're like while you are at school like has anybody been sick i know like with you know covid has been going around but like have you noticed anybody like that sick all the time around you patient: sick all the time everybody is sick these days","5049":"doctor: alright patient: so","5050":"doctor: but what about at home how about your siblings are any of them sick patient: most of them are healthy yeah most of them are healthy although you know i have a brother who smokes i have told him not to smoke he does n't listen","5051":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: house told not to smoke at the house but you know anyway","5052":"doctor: okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct patient: yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep","5053":"doctor: i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay patient: sure","5054":"doctor: alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt patient: no","5055":"doctor: okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain patient: no","5056":"doctor: alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerular nephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment patient: how much are all these tests going to cost","5057":"doctor: they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them patient: okay that's that's good to know","5058":"doctor: i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today patient: okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this","5059":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: and right after that i have to go to work","5060":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i","5061":"doctor: no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh patient: well yeah this new job there is no insurance and my old boss sucks so i'm hoping i'll get a new boss and you know hopefully some free food with with this ut because it's had a restaurant so we'll we'll see how that goes","5062":"doctor: we might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we do n't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay patient: got it","5063":"doctor: alright okay so do you have any more questions before i send my nurse in patient: do i need

patient: yeah i'm taking my wife puts in the my box i take something twice a day i know that","5095":"doctor: okay how is your wife doing she is a very lovely person i i i remember seeing her at your last visit patient: she is doing fine","5096":"doctor: yeah i say the same thing to my husband okay well let's go ahead i wanted you to just do a quick physical exam so i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so looking here at your vital signs you know you do n't have a fever here in the office which is good your temperature is ninety eight . four on your blood pressure it seems like you are doing a pretty good job monitoring your blood pressure your blood pressure is right where it should be it's about one twenty five over sixty two which is good your heart rate is nice and slow in the eighties and your oxygenation is fine it's ninety seven percent on room air so all of that is is really good now on on your facial exam i'm just pressing on your face here do you have any pain to palpation patient: just right underneath my eyes","5097":"doctor: on one on what side patient: actually both","5098":"doctor: okay okay on on facial examination the patient has pain to palpation of the bilateral maxillary sinuses on nasal exam there are there is erythema and edema of the nasal turbinates bilaterally with associated yellow discharge on throat exam can you open up your mouth on your throat exam the the uvula is midline there is no erythema or edema or exudate in the peritonsillar space on neck examination i do appreciate some bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and on your lung exam there is coarse rhonchi present bilaterally that clears with cough on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur and on your right knee exam does it hurt when i press here patient: yep","5099":"doctor: okay there is pain to palpation on the right knee and i'm just gon na move it all around does that hurt patient: little bit yeah","5100":"doctor: okay so there is decreased flexion and extension of the right knee there is associated ecchymosis to the right medial knee there is no evidence of an effusion okay so billy what does all of that mean that means that you just have signs of that you have a little bit of an upper respiratory infection that might have caused some congestion in your in your lungs which we will talk about okay and then and as far as your knee exam it just shows that you do have some inflammation and some evidence that you had injured it earlier so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you for all of these issues okay so for your first problem of your cough you know i do believe that you just have a a viral syndrome at this time you probably have some mild bronchitis i really just wan na go ahead and just you know recommend some supportive care you can continue to take over the counter medications we can prescribe guaifenesin six hundred six hundred milligrams twice a day to help cough up some of that phlegm and i do n't think you need need any antibiotics at this time but certainly if your symptoms worsen i want you to call me and then we can go ahead and consider ordering a chest x-ray to make sure that you do n't have any pneumonia okay how does that sound patient: that sounds good","5101":"doctor: okay so for your second problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have a a a right medial collateral ligament strain from the fall this morning and i really wan na just go ahead and and i'll prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and we can refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen those muscles around that area and i'm gon na go ahead and just order a right knee x-ray just to make sure that you did n't injure any bones although i do n't think you did but we'll just go ahead and order that right knee x-ray how does that sound patient: okay that sounds like good good plan","5102":"doctor: okay and then for your third problem of your hypertension let's just continue on the lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and lastly your fourth problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c just to make sure we do n't have to make any adjustments to your metformin and i really want you to try to monitor your sugar intake and report your blood sugars to me through the patient portal how does that sound patient: okay i'll try that i try my best","5103":"doctor: alright that sounds good i'll i'll be in touch with you with those results okay patient: okay appreciate it","5104":"doctor: alright take care bye","5105":"doctor: alright okay theresa so i understand that you're you're having a bit of some headache here and then your blood pressure has been running high can you tell me a little bit about what's happening patient: yeah i've had blood high blood pressure for a long time my provider gave me chlorthalidone i do n't really take it because it gives me a stomachache but yeah i get headaches right here on the top of my head they kinda come and go they're throbbing tylenol helps the headache","5106":"doctor: okay alright and then so how long have you had this headache has this been recent or like acute or you've been having this for since you've had your blood pressures patient: hmmm it's been on and off for about a month","5107":"doctor: a month okay alright and then are you having any other kind of symptoms with that like are you having any kind of you know dizziness lightheadedness any nausea vomiting patient: yeah sometimes i feel dizzy and my vision gets a little blurry","5108":"doctor: okay alright how about like chest pain or shortness of breath are you experiencing any of that when you have these headaches in your blood pressure patient: chest pain or shortness of breath","5109":"doctor: okay very good alright and then you said you were you've taken some tylenol for that and you said it did help a little bit or did n't sorry patient: it does help","5110":"doctor: it does help good very good so how often are you taking your your medication are you taking that as prescribed like daily it sounds like you missed a few times but for the most part are you taking it patient: yeah i forget a lot so i probably take it like every other day","5111":"doctor: okay every other day alright and then are you also now i know you also have some diabetes so are you how are you doing with that one are you pretty much taking your metformin everyday patient: hmmm i probably take it when i take my other medicine like every other day","5112":"doctor: every other day okay so i do see that you know the nurse took your your vital signs this morning that your blood pressure is running quite a bit high it was like one seventy two over ninety eight so that's that's really a little higher than where we want it to be especially that you're on your medication but what we're gon na do is we're gon na take i'm gon na take a look at you real quick and then we can discuss you know maybe there's some changes that we can do in terms of your current regimen how about diet and your have you been sticking with that low sodium diet at all patient: no i love mcdonald's i eat it all the time","5113":"doctor: i love mcdonald's too my favorite is big mac i do n't know about you but i got ta have my big mac with those large fries which you what's your favorite mcdonald's treat there patient: i need to think of what fully of fish i love flare of fish","5114":"doctor: well at least you're eating the fish but but they can be very high in sodium especially the fast foods so we'll have to talk about maybe they can look at you know some some diet changes as well so the other thing is for your for your blood sugar here i see that you know you're running a bit high as well it looks like you're like you're about one seventy this morning and i i i i assume that you were fasting last night is that right okay so that's that's a little higher than what we want it's not bad it's below two hundred but it's getting kinda close to the borderline from where our limit is so we will take we take a look at that and also we'll figure out what we can do with that as well alright so at this point how about are you how is how is work how is life it's been good otherwise how's the family patient: they are good i did eat a lot of my kids easter candy over the weekend so maybe that's why my sugar is high","5115":"doctor: okay alright great alright alright just just around easter okay not not too much during the the year hopefully patient: yeah i try","5116":"doctor: well that's good so let's go ahead and do a physical exam on you real quick here okay and so i'm looking at your vital signs it looks like your blood pressure i we mentioned that today is pretty high your heart rate looks good it's with it's within normal limits here and then your oxygenation is fine so you did mention you did n't have any shortness of breath so that's good so let me just feel around your neck real quick here i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention on your neck exam i no carotid bruits so that's good let me go ahead and listen to your lungs and your heart here real quick alright so on your auscultation of your lungs they're clear bilaterally on your heart exam though i i do sense a two out of six systolic ejection murmur now that was also there last year so it has n't changed any so we'll just keep monitoring that one and then let me take a look at your extremities here real quick theresa so let me look at your hands you got a little bit of slight edema bilaterally on your upper extremities but let me look at your legs here okay so you have a one plus pitting edema noted here on your legs bilaterally so that means you're retaining a lot of that salt that you're eating unfortunately okay so so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan here so definitely what you're experiencing is some uncontrolled hypertension now most of the time you know it's multifactorial right it's your diet it could be the medication regimen if you're not following that and then it might be that we are gon na need to change the medication around and also change your diet but i would like to start with going ahead and i want to continue your current medication regimen today i do wan na really encourage that you do take that everyday maybe set a reminder like on your you know do you use your iphone a lot for your reminders and things maybe we can go ahead and do that get a reminder make sure that you take that everyday but with that i would like to go ahead and also monitor your blood pressure let's do it three times a week it can be much when we do it everyday but maybe three times a week do you have a blood pressure monitor at home patient: no","5117":"doctor: okay so i can recommend some really good ones nowadays that you can use at home and they're not that expensive and at least it'll give you some you know idea of what your blood pressure is running at and then i want you to come back like in a month because i wan na go ahead and see how your blood pressure is doing now that you know you're you you're taking your blood pressure medication everyday the other thing is i do wan na go ahead and have a nutritionist come and talk to you about you may maybe some dietary changes i'd like for you to start a \u2013 diet it's really to to help you know a lot of reduce a lot of that sodium intake when you're when you're when you're taking in your food so a nutritionist is gon na be able to help you figure out some foods that you know that you may like that you can actually use as an alternative besides the mcdonald's although you can have that once in a blue moon but you know not not too often okay patient: okay sounds good","5118":"doctor: great and then for your diabetes i wan na go ahead and let's go ahead and increase your your metformin to fifteen hundred milligrams i think all for that too i want you to go ahead and continue taking your blood sugars to make sure as as you normally would to make sure that you know that change in medication is is actually being effective alright do you have any other questions for me at this time patient: nope","5119":"doctor: okay great well i'm gon na have the nurse check you out and and i'll have the scheduler schedule you for a one month follow-up we'll take a look and see how you're doing from there see if we have then we will move from there okay patient: sounds good thank you","5120":"doctor: thanks theresa","5121":"doctor: hey steven so i see that you're here and you've been experiencing some back pain for a while could you tell me a bit about that patient: yeah it's been back has been hurting for a while","5122":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: for about a couple of years and tried a couple things but nothing seems to work","5123":"doctor: okay so let's start start with what happened did something cause the pain patient: i think well i played basketball and i bumped one time and i fell and i hit i think i fell on my back got fell real hard","5124":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: so it's been hurting after ever since that","5125":"doctor: okay and then how severe is the pain on a scale of like one to ten patient: i think it's around a seven","5126":"doctor: wow okay could you describe it for me is it like sharp is it throbbing patient: it it hurts pretty bad it's it's sharp","5127":"doctor: and does it radiate patient: sometimes it hurts more than others and i'm not sure why","5128":"doctor: and does it radiate anywhere patient: yeah it goes down my leg my left leg","5129":"doctor: okay alright patient: like my toes get numb a little sometimes","5130":"doctor: wow okay and how about like so hmmm you said it goes down your left leg how about any like are you experiencing any loss of sensation in like the genital or rectal area patient: i hope not","5131":"doctor: that's okay i i it's gon na help me isolate like what's what exactly is going on so please do n't feel embarrassed to answer the questions do you have any weakness patient: yeah sometimes i try to stand up and and and like i i ca n't go get weak or if i'm standing up for too long","5132":"doctor: okay so would you would you say that there are certain positions that make you feel better or worse patient: yeah like lying on my side makes me feel better","5133":"doctor: and then you said that standing also makes it worse right patient: yeah if i stand for a while","5134":"doctor: okay and then have you experienced any like loss of control of like your bladder or your bowels patient: yeah i pooped myself once","5135":"doctor: okay so incontinence just once though like over the last two years right it's not like a consistent thing patient: no it's not consistent i think i stood up for too long i think i was drinking too","5136":"doctor: okay okay you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past like what were they patient: so i i had a doc gave me some injections before i'm not sure what they were though","5137":"doctor: okay alright and i see in your chart here that you had physical therapy did you feel that that was effective patient: no i feel like i could do them the same exercises at my house like they charged me and like it","5138":"doctor: okay but did the did the exercises help patient: i mean i guess a little","5139":"doctor: okay not a so not as effective as we would have liked did they put you on any pain medications patient: yeah it was just a white pill i'm not sure what it was","5140":"doctor: okay do n't worry i think i can look that up in your chart i just wan na make sure that we have the story straight alright so i know that you said that you mentioned that you played basketball you know before how how like what's your activity like now patient: i mean i sit at home all day","5141":"doctor: okay that's a pretty okay that's a pretty significant weight gain well i i just have a few more questions have you do you know if any of your family members have spine conditions patient: i think my fourth cousin has scoliosis","5142":"doctor: okay okay but that's that's a little distant but anybody direct like sister brother mom dad patient: i do n't think so i mean i do n't even my dad though","5143":"doctor: okay okay and then do you have a personal history of smoking patient: what type of smoking","5144":"doctor: any smoke you do n't have to tell me exactly but patient: okay","5145":"doctor: have you smoked patient: next maybe that i have n't","5146":"doctor: are you it's okay i'm your doctor i'm not here to judge you i just want to make sure that i'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you i need to know this information so one more time do you smoke or have you smoked before patient: okay i smoked","5147":"doctor: okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it patient: i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked","5148":"doctor: okay you have patient: too many questions are you the fit","5149":"doctor: i'm your doctor i have to patient: are you the fence you sound like the fence next question","5150":"doctor: i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking patient: no","5151":"doctor: okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things patient: sent them off yeah","5152":"doctor: pardon patient: because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen","5153":"doctor: you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt patient: yeah it hurts","5154":"doctor: okay and when you bend backward does it hurt patient: a little bit","5155":"doctor: okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up patient: stop","5156":"doctor: okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the patient: what does that mean like am i dying","5157":"doctor: no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay patient: that's a big word","5158":"doctor: those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something patient: i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that","5159":"doctor: we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection patient: okay","5160":"doctor: alright patient: can i get pain pills too","5161":"doctor: can you patient: for pain","5162":"doctor: can you get what now patient: pain pills","5163":"doctor: so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have patient: i'd say it was n't effective","5164":"doctor: okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective patient: yeah i said i said the white ones i said they worked","5165":"doctor: okay i'm sorry so alright so maybe when let's okay so what we're still gon na do though we're gon na do the injection and then if it still hurts after that then we can explore that pain medication i do n't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication it's not necessarily like a good long term solution if after we monitor this you still are experiencing pain we are gon na try the pain meds however i would maybe recommend surgery patient: i do n't want i know","5166":"doctor: right and so this is we're just gon na try everything that we can before you know before we get to that place patient: mm-hmm","5167":"doctor: do you have any questions patient: no","5168":"doctor: alright patient: when it when is it when am i having this this when do you want me to get this injection","5169":"doctor: okay so you're gon na go to the front and schedule it this is a very quick and common procedure it should only take about an hour we will need to do this note like if this if this is successful we would only maybe do this four times a year so whenever at the front desk go ahead and schedule i think that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this alright any other questions patient: no","5170":"doctor: okay thank you","5171":"doctor: good morning sharon how you doing patient: hi i'm i'm okay today i'm having some shoulder pain","5172":"doctor: i see that i see that here in the nurse's notes it looks like you're having some right shoulder pain says here that you've guys have been remodeling your house what do you do you remember what you were doing when that right shoulder pain started patient: yeah i was up on a ladder painting and kinda reaching out and fell took a fall and kinda braced myself but i i was painting","5173":"doctor: okay so it does sound like there might have been some direct trauma to that area now it says here that this happened about three weeks ago were you able it sounds like you were able to get up and continue but you were having some pain did you take anything at that time to help with that shoulder pain patient: yeah i i iced the arm and then i also i also took some advil","5174":"doctor: okay now have you had any shoulder pain before of that right shoulder or is this the first time or or the first insult to that area patient: first time","5175":"doctor: okay and now are you able to move that right arm for me patient: yes i'm able to move but i do have some pain lifting overhead raising my arm overhead","5176":"doctor: okay alright now do you have pain all the time or does it come and go patient: it is some pain is all the time but it some is intermittent","5177":"doctor: okay now i you mentioned that you had taken some ibuprofen for that pain now let's talk a little bit about your pain rating okay zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life can you rate your pain for me without any tylenol or advil or any nsaid can you rate your pain for me patient: about a six","5178":"doctor: okay now when you take that medication can you rate your pain for me what what's that pain level get to patient: it goes down to about a four","5179":"doctor: okay so it does help take the edge off of that pain and and you're able to kinda move around a little bit then patient: yes","5180":"doctor: okay so the remodel tell me a little bit about that my wife and i were working on our remodel and we went they just built the brand-new lowe's here in town have you guys been there yet patient: no we have not","5181":"doctor: well i did n't know if you know this or not but you can save big money there that's the rumor patient: okay","5182":"doctor: so yeah we we've been down there we got some pain we we got went and got some samples and then hey while we were there we ended up deciding to put down a bunch of flooring too so i really recommend you guys if you get a chance go over there and take a look at their sales and and see if you ca n't finish your remodeled project patient: that sounds great i'll have to take a look at the flooring as well","5183":"doctor: that sounds good so now just out of curiosity are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in in your arm or hand patient: i did when i initially hurt it but i'm not no longer having any numbness or tingling","5184":"doctor: okay so a little bit about my physical exam i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you today now your vitals look good but specifically on your right shoulder exam you do have limited active and passive range of motion and there is tenderness to the greater tuberosity of the humerus now there is no tenderness at your sternoclavicular joint and you do have good strong bilateral hand grips and on your neurovascular exam of your right arm you do have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds and you do have equal and bilateral response to sensation and touch which is good now taking a look at your x-ray that we did when you came in today good news is that right shoulder x-ray reveals no fracture or bony abnormality mkay so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now i your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy i think that you've injured the tendons of the muscles that make up the shoulder so that i think that's that's why you are having the that shoulder pain i do wan na order an mri of that right shoulder just to make sure that nothing else is going on now i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy and that's gon na be about six to eight weeks now my patients are very successful with their pt and let's see how you do before we make the decision that we would do additional treatment such as a steroid injection to that shoulder i do want you to continue to take an nsaid if you can tolerate tylenol i want you to go ahead and take tylenol for that pain do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan patient: no i think it sounds good ca n't wait to to get some relief","5185":"doctor: okay so i know we ordered it for six to eight weeks but i wan na see you again in two weeks and we'll evaluate how you're doing and make some additional treatment plan at that at that time okay patient: okay","5186":"doctor: alright sounds good we will get the nurse come in and she will take care of you and i will see you in two weeks patient: thank you","5187":"doctor: thank you","5188":"doctor: good afternoon matthew how are you patient: i'm okay","5189":"doctor: it looks like here that the that you've been brought in for some vision changes and looks like you're having trouble with your right eye can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in to see me today patient: yeah you know i started noticing my wife and i we we eat out almost every night and it's when especially when we go to fancy place","5190":"doctor: mm-hmm patient: i have trouble adjusting in the that dark dim environment","5191":"doctor: okay and i reviewed my technician's notes before i came in to see you and it says you know you you've been having that decreased vision when you're reading especially in dark place like you just said but it also mentions here that it looks like you told her that when you look at straight lines like in your door frame it looks like things have been looking a little crooked to you how long has that been going on patient: well you know it's been going on a little while probably getting worse over the last three to four months and you know my my office has paneling and you know how that paneling has that dark grooves in it those straight lines well they always look wavy to me","5192":"doctor: okay alright so it's been going on a few months now you mentioned that you and your wife go out to eat every night have you tried the new the new italium place over there on main street patient: my gosh yes we were just there the other night down in the it's down in the basement of that big building yeah we went there the other night and i got ta tell you it was like the saprano family was sitting across from us there was this bunch of old guys that had bottles of of red wine all over the table and they were my gosh it was so good and the food i mean i mean i ca n't tell you how great the food was","5193":"doctor: it was amazing my wife and i went over there the other day and when we walked downstairs it was like i was walking into a scene out of saprano's patient: mm-hmm","5194":"doctor: but the food was amazing it was the best egg plant parmer's john i've i've ever had where really super excited about going back there here very very soon patient: yeah i had the bio marsal and it was my gosh it was to die for","5195":"doctor: i'll have to get that next time i go so in reviewing your paperwork here it looks like you made mention that you smoke are you still smoking about a pack a day patient: yeah i i tried i've tried i've done hypnosis i've done lozenges i've done chewing gum and i get real close but you know i'll just go out one evening without the wife and and the next thing i know i'm i'm you know buying a cigarette off of somebody and it's it's really hard for me to get that stopped","5196":"doctor: yeah i i appreciate that but it's really gon na be important that you try to to either cut back or quit smoking altogether now that leads me into my next concern here it looks like you have a history of high blood pressure and i'm just wondering are you are you taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and and are you checking your blood pressures on a regular basis patient: i'm glad you just mentioned that because i have n't taken my blood pressure pill for a while it's up in the cupboard and it's back in that corner and i just i ca n't forget to take it","5197":"doctor: okay it's really gon na be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed i'd really like to see you start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and and let's set that that pill bottle down on the counter and see if that does n't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam on your eyes i'm gon na go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me patient: okay that's a bright light","5198":"doctor: yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection patient: have you ever somebody stick a needle in your eye","5199":"doctor: yeah literally yeah patient: yeah","5200":"doctor: the good news is injection given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it however i also have to let you know that there could be a situation where you may still note a small amount of vision loss but this is your best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as you can so i know i have given you a lot of information i wan na pause here and see if you have any questions comments or concerns before we get you scheduled for that injection patient: no i'm i mean as as long as you think it wo n't hurt a lot that will be good","5201":"doctor: okay i think it's gon na be our best plan to help slow this disease process patient: okay","5202":"doctor: alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and we're gon na go ahead and do the first injection today patient: okay okay","5203":"doctor: sounds good i'll be back in a couple of minutes patient: okay thank you very much","5204":"doctor: thank you","5205":"doctor: okay well hi joe i understand you've hurt your knee how how are you doing patient: i'm doing okay this feels you know definitely feels like it's swollen and kinda hurts me a little bit","5206":"doctor: so what did you do what happened patient: i was i was skiing with some with some friends and i was going down it was snowing pretty hard and i could n't really see as as the two paths kind of come came together and i the front end of the skis i kind of dug into the snow and i ended up basically doing a cart wheel but kinda like stopped halfway through and could feel a pop in my my right knee and then you know just pain right after that came about through the knee so","5207":"doctor: yeah that sounds painful and so when did this occur patient: it it occurred over the weekend on saturday","5208":"doctor: and have you been able to to walk at all at all or no patient: a a little bit but it's definitely swollen and it's definitely painful","5209":"doctor: okay so what all have you been doing for the pain patient: just like taking some you know advil and then just icing you know icing on and off you know a little heat here and there just you know trying to comfort but that's about it","5210":"doctor: have you ever had any type of injury to your knee before and it is this the left or right knee patient: it's the right knee no it's the first time i've had any knee injuries","5211":"doctor: okay alright let's see take anything for it okay well let's see let's just do a quick physical exam here so so your now your vitals those look alright your no fever you're at ninety seven . nine your heart rate is sixty four sounds healthy respirations are sixteen blood pressure is one ten over seventy four your o2 sat looks good at you know ninety eight percent so look real healthy there and so i'm just gon na do a quick physical exam so i do appreciate some edema and some ecchymosis around surrounding your knee your right you said right knee right patient: yeah","5212":"doctor: okay positive pain to palpation and let's bring your leg out are you having pain when with flexion or extension patient: a little bit no not not crazy real pain but there is definitely some pain there","5213":"doctor: okay pain with flexion and extension and how about the range of motion having full range of motion here patient: yeah pretty much i can get the full range just feels a little tight and will hurt","5214":"doctor: okay alright and for diagnostics so your x-ray so there's no fracture appreciated no bony abnormalities so that looks alright so let me tell you a little bit about my impression and plan with this so you have a knee contusion so for treatment we'll we need to rest that apply ice you know two three times a day for twenty minutes at a time take some nsaids or you know nonsteroidal anti- inflamma medication such as ibuprofen every six to eight hours as needed so i just wan na really get some rest with that if that does n't improve then we can go ahead and maybe come back in and we might do some physical therapy as well i do n't know i'm not sure i like this one all that well any do you have any questions on that patient: no sounds very good","5215":"doctor: okay let's venture a little bit more because i need five minutes so where so where were you skiing at patient: so i was actually up we actually took a trip up up north and i was in the i'm in mount saint helen and washington so i was just walking in myself going out and stuff but yeah it was it was a good trip but cut a little short because of that yeah it was fun though i like going i like going to skiing so hopefully i can do some more","5216":"doctor: well washington sounds nice i have n't been there but it sounds like it's pretty nice area to be in and they have a lot of maple syrup there do n't they produce a lot of maple syrup patient: they do they do have a lot of maple syrup and it's it's it's interesting that the the winter actually is n't their busiest time for vacation or vacations or it's more into your spring into your fall with hikers and all the outdoor activities there's actually a very impulsive torist during the summertime which i never knew but one of the locals have told me that they do actually better business during the summer so the hikers kayakers and the maple syrup in the fall and everything so","5217":"doctor: that sounds good now i also meant to ask you so when you did this cartwheel through the air did you have any other injuries to any other parts of your body anything else that you're having any issues with patient: my shoulder feels a little bruised","5218":"doctor: okay let's take a quick look yeah i do appreciate a little bit of bruising here are you having any problem raising it up or or with movement with your range of motion patient: once i raise it up though it's a it is a little little tender i can feel it being tender when i raise it up","5219":"doctor: okay we'll just go ahead and get an x-ray of that right shoulder too just to be sure if you because who knows maybe you might have done something with that as well so we'll go ahead and have my nurse take you to do that and then we'll talk again alright patient: sounds great","5220":"doctor: hey angela how are you patient: i'm good how are you","5221":"doctor: i'm good so i see we are here you had a recent diagnosis of stage three nonsmol cell lung cancer and so we are following up on your neo adevant chemotherapy so you can you tell me how you're doing today patient: yeah you know i'm i'm doing okay i have a little bit of some shortness of breath that i noticed over the weekend and you know i i'm i considered myself pretty active before this i would walk my dog around the block and now i i ca n't even walk you know down the street without being short of breath","5222":"doctor: okay yeah yeah i mean that's that's definitely understandable it says you had a four point four centimeter left upper lobe nodule in there so it's kinda big but that's understandable and we're doing the chemo to try to reduce that that that tumor that you do have so how often do you normally run with your dogs patient: i mean i would i would take them for i would normally take them for like mile long walks everyday and just this weekend i could only walk down to the end of the street i had to have my husband take the dog fit walk","5223":"doctor: man okay what kind of dog do you have patient: i have a dobrman","5224":"doctor: yeah they are pretty active that makes sense alright so have you been coughing have you had any phlegm patient: i've been having a dry cough no phlegm","5225":"doctor: okay have you noticed any fever patient: no fever","5226":"doctor: no fever alright what about any other symptoms like any body aches any sore throat sinus pain patient: well i mean now that you mentioned it like every time i swallow it hurts it does n't feel like i have a cold because it hurts down here more in my chest but every time i swallow it it's really painful","5227":"doctor: okay so when you are swallowing i know some of my patients feel this do you feel like the food is getting stuck patient: no the food is not getting stuck it just hurts","5228":"doctor: okay what about when you're you're taking liquids are you able to take in both hydrocort liquids patient: i mean i definitely feel like over the weekend i have n't been taking it as much because it hurt so much but i i am able to i am able to drink and i've been taking ensure and things like that i had a milk shake","5229":"doctor: okay that's that's that's that's good yeah we we definitely want you to to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you wo n't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though patient: it's very helpful you know as you can understand i'm just like devastated when i got this diagnosis and i'm just i'm just trying to figure everything out and but he is very good and my daughter is is very helpful too and i you know i think for the most part i'm very fortunate to have them","5230":"doctor: okay so how how are you feeling on your chemo see you're on a combination of sysplatin and a topicide you had your last dose a few days ago any nausea any fatigue from that patient: i was a little nauseated and tired but i took the zofran that you prescribed and that seemed to help and you know i i got some rest it's it's it's been okay","5231":"doctor: okay that's good so let me do a quick physical exam on you just gon na check your vitals here so your vitals are normal your pulse ox is okay so everything's good with that so i'm gon na feel your neck on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy no subclavicular adenopathy your heart exam regular rate and rhythm no murmur your lung exam so i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally that's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath so that could mean you have some fluid in there and that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis so i'm gon na look at your skin exam so on your skin exam on your chest i do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side and that could be due to that radiation sometimes patients do get a radiation burn and it's it'll get better with time especially once you're done with the the radiation treatment and on your extremity it there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me you did get a chest x-ray it looks like you do have mild radiation umitis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so your first diagnosis you know is is the lung cancer so we are gon na continue you on that chemo regimen on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses i think you're on forty five grade yep you're on that and then when the when the regimen's complete we'll do some more testing and hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor so that has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out so for your second diagnosis the radiation pneumonitis i'm gon na prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams one tablet a day for five days have you been on on a steroids before patient: no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight","5232":"doctor: i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay patient: okay","5233":"doctor: alright so do you have any questions for me patient: no","5234":"doctor: alright so we will get you those medications those prescriptions and then we will see you back in two weeks patient: okay great thank you","5235":"doctor: thanks","5236":"doctor: hey joshua good to see you today so take a look at your chart here brenda and i see that you're coming in you you have i think you have a kidney stone so can you tell me what's going on how are you feeling and you're my my patient patient: and i'm your patient yeah","5237":"doctor: okay so is it is it a constant pain or does it come and go for you patient: it comes and goes it depends on how much i've been drinking and you know what sort of activities i've been doing but it's still there","5238":"doctor: alright so have you noticed any pain when you've been urinating patient: not really","5239":"doctor: okay have you noticed any blood in your urine patient: no blood i did have an episode where the pain radiated to one of my testicles which was kinda weird but but yeah it it sort of calmed down a little bit in that regards","5240":"doctor: okay have you taken anything for the pain patient: yeah i've been taking some ibuprofen and that kinda like calms it down a little bit but it persists","5241":"doctor: okay and what would you say like your pain score is out of ten patient: it's probably a four out of ten when it gets a little more out of control for the most part it's probably in the order of one or two out of ten","5242":"doctor: okay so it is it's it's it's not too bad patient: it's a new ones yeah but i know it's there it does n't go away","5243":"doctor: okay yeah yeah a lot of my patients you know have that that minor pain so you patient: i'm a horrible active by the way","5244":"doctor: no yeah that's that's that's totally fine that's totally fine you know i'm just playing the doctor on tv so good good alright so have you had any other symptoms nausea vomiting anything like that patient: no nausea no vomiting i had some i felt like it might have been like chills but no fevers nothing along those lines","5245":"doctor: okay that's good do you know anybody in your family that has had kidney stones in the past patient: yeah all in my family has had kidney stones in the past","5246":"doctor: no well they did n't set you up good did they patient: yeah i i i guess i can blame them but but yeah it's been a it's been an issue with the family for as long as i've been aware of","5247":"doctor: okay alright and i'm reading here it looks like you've had them before as well right patient: i have yeah i passed some by myself and i've had to have surgery a couple of times as well","5248":"doctor: okay so the ones that you passed by yourself how many days would you say it would take to to pass patient: usually within within a week i manage to to get them out","5249":"doctor: okay alright so you got anything fun plan for the weekend patient: just getting this pain under control","5250":"doctor: okay well that that sounds like a good plan we can definitely help you out with that alright so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated and i think that's probably because you're in pain and that's understandable everything else looks fine so on pressing on your abdomen does that hurt patient: no no no pain","5251":"doctor: alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in patient: yeah it's a little tender yeah it's little tender","5252":"doctor: okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of high flow nephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you patient: so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible","5253":"doctor: okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer patient: they did they did yeah and i've been i've been using that but so far nothing","5254":"doctor: okay so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate so hopefully we can catch the stone i'm also gon na order a bmp a urinalysis and urine culture and based on what that shows we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics i do n't think you have an infection but you know there is that possibility and then i want to see you again in one to two weeks if you are still having symptoms and if you know you still have the stone with you we can talk about further treatment possible lithotripsy you know that's the shockwave treatment i'm pretty sure you've had that prior to patient: yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i want","5255":"doctor: what that is okay so do you have any other questions for me patient: no i'm friend","5256":"doctor: alright so i'll see you again in two weeks i'll have my nurse come in and bring you that prescription for the tramadol and i think we are all good patient: perfect thank you","5257":"doctor: alright great","5258":"doctor: hi frank how are you i heard the medical assistant told me that you're having some shortness of breath patient: i am i am i am okay i am not great","5259":"doctor: you are okay you are not great okay well how long have you been having some shortness of breath patient: it's been about a week","5260":"doctor: it's been about a week okay now have you ever experienced these symptoms before patient: yeah this happened about six months ago and i came in and they changed my lasix dose and i seemed to get better","5261":"doctor: okay alright so let's talk a little bit about that now i know that you have a history of coronary disease you know you had had a heart attack back in twenty eighteen we put that stent in your right coronary artery i know that the pumping function of your heart was a little low you know that what we call that ejection fraction was about thirty five percent have you been watching your salt intake patient: yeah but you know it's been the holidays the last couple of weeks and you know i we've had a bunch of family get togethers and i i do n't think my diet has been everything it should have been","5262":"doctor: okay alright now have you noticed any swelling in your legs patient: yes definitely","5263":"doctor: okay and are you taking the lasix now i know that we had increased it to about forty milligrams once a day are you taking it patient: yeah i take it everyday","5264":"doctor: you take it everyday okay do you notice that you're urinating any less recently patient: no it seems about the same","5265":"doctor: okay alright and do you feel short of breath at rest or is it mostly when you're just walking around patient: walking around stairs in particular walking quickly","5266":"doctor: okay and how about when you're sleeping at night are you able to lay flat or do you have to sit up a little bit patient: i gone from one pillow to two pillows","5267":"doctor: okay alright and do you ever wake up really short of breath does it ever wake you up patient: it did that six months ago it has not done that so far this time","5268":"doctor: okay alright now tell me a little bit about when was the last time you saw your nephrologist patient: about about a month ago","5269":"doctor: okay because as you know you know we we do talk about the fact that you have some kidney dysfunction about stage three so it's gon na be important for you to continue to follow up with your kidney doctor now are you how are you doing staying away from things like motrin and advil i know that you had had some knee pain in the past and you know how are you doing staying away from those medications patient: yeah everybody has told me not to use it so i do n't except when i have pretty bad pain i had an episode about a week ago some pain in my feet actually and i i had to take motrin to get rid of it so yeah i took motrin for a while and i stopped as quickly as i could","5270":"doctor: okay now are you able to take tylenol do you not feel any relief from tylenol when you take it patient: yeah tylenol's lovely it just is not very effective","5271":"doctor: okay alright yeah because i think we really want you to stay away from that those anti-inflammatories because that can make your kidney function worse and obviously you know we do n't wan na see you go on dialysis or anything like that so we'll have patient: mean neither","5272":"doctor: right so we'll have to you know really work on that now tell me a little bit about are you watching the potassium and stuff in your diet patient: nobody's really talked to me about that so","5273":"doctor: okay yeah so you want patient: i did n't know what high potassium foods are","5274":"doctor: okay i'm sorry i've never talked to you about that in the past i that's my fault so yeah so you wan na make sure you stay away from things like bananas oranges you know potatoes have lots of potassium that type of thing and so you know because with your kidney function you know that can cause your potassium levels to go up because you do n't get rid of the potassium as you should you know patient: something to eat","5275":"doctor: what's that patient: is there anything left is there anything left over that i ca n't eat","5276":"doctor: so yeah you can eat you know how about this how about we give you a a referral to a dietitian and they can help you with that patient: sounds good","5277":"doctor: now are you watching the nba playoff should i or should i not bring that up i is that a sensitive subject i mean i'm a self expand and and we did sweep the nuts so patient: yeah well i mean that's fan and i could n't sleep last night but you know","5278":"doctor: okay well maybe we should n't talk about patient: kinda used to it you know where they where the favorite to win and then like that","5279":"doctor: yeah i know i i i will say i think jason tatum and jaylen brown paid played phenomenally so i do think that they help with the cell fix over the edge so but that's all we'll talk about that what's that patient: i said yeah too bad they did","5280":"doctor: yeah alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you okay so you know looking at your vital signs here in the office you know your your blood pressure is about one thirty five over eighty so it's it's not too bad and maybe like to see it a little bit lower i'm just gon na be calling out my physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so on your neck exam i appreciate some jugular venous distention up to about nine centimeters there are no carotid bruits on your lung exam i do appreciate bibasilar crackles with occasional rhonchi that clears when you cough on your heart exam i do appreciate a three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate one to two plus pitting edema bilaterally so frank what does that mean all that means is that you have findings on you that suggest that you're retaining fluid now we'll have to talk a little bit about how we're going to address that okay so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you okay so for the for your first problem of your shortness of breath i do believe you're having a an acute heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and increase your lasix from forty milligrams a day to eighty milligrams a day and i want you to call me in two days and let me know how your weight has been with increasing the diuretic now if you start to have worsening shortness of breath before that i want you to yeah call me we may have to admit you to the hospital for some intravenous diuretics okay i also wan na go ahead and just obtain patient: salt on lasix all at once am i take it all at once or do i divide it up","5281":"doctor: how about you start taking the the increased dose in the morning and then we'll see how you do and if necessary i'll have to add a second dose in the afternoon that you can take around four o'clock in the afternoon i do n't want you to take it too late at night because then you will be going to the bathroom all night okay patient: that sounds correct","5282":"doctor: so i also want to go ahead and order a chest x-ray just to make sure that we are not missing anything else okay for your second problem of your coronary artery disease you know it sounds like you're doing well except for this heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and order another echocardiogram to check out that heart murmur that i hear on your physical exam just to make sure that that's not getting any worse and to make sure that the pumping function of your heart is stable and i'm gon na go ahead and call doctor white and let them know that i want you to be seen by them okay okay and then for your third problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i want you to go ahead and try to you know do n't please do n't take anymore motrin or advil i do want you to try to stick with tylenol and if you're still having a significant problem with with some pain i want you to call me and we'll talk about some alternative medications that we can use or therapies okay i will also want to go ahead and order a complete metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable does that sound okay patient: that sounds good do you have any idea what was going on with my foot pain before","5283":"doctor: well how long have you been having it how long you've been having that foot pain patient: that's why i took the motrin it lasted you know four five days slowly went away","5284":"doctor: it was in both of your feet patient: one","5285":"doctor: one and where in your foot was was it patient: just in front of the big toe","5286":"doctor: just in front of the big toe okay have you ever had a history of gout patient: nobody has told me about that","5287":"doctor: okay alright well it sounds like it could've been gout you know with your chronic kidneys chronic kidney disease it it's a possibility so for this possible gout flare for your fourth problem of your possible gout flare let's go ahead i wan na just go ahead and order a uric acid just to see and it's something that we can talk about there is an alternative medication that you can take with your kidney function that that would n't hurt it that would n't injure it any further and i think it would work just the same patient: okay","5288":"doctor: okay any other questions patient: just as long as you think i'm gon na get better","5289":"doctor: i think you're gon na get better yes i think we're gon na you know i really want you to watch your salt intake and i'm gon na go ahead and order

today with complaints of joint pain . andrew , what's going on with your joint ? what happened ?","30":"okay . is , is one knee worse than the other ?","31":"and did you , did you injure one of them ?","32":"okay . all right . and , and what have you taken for the pain ?","33":"okay . all right . um , and does it prevent you from doing , like , your activities of daily living , like walking and

know that you told dr. gutierrez-","40":". a couple of weeks ago .","41":"everything's okay ?","42":"all right . and you're taking your immunosuppressive medications ?","43":"okay . all right . um , and did they have anything to say ? i have n't gotten any reports from them , so ...","44":"okay . all right . um , and in terms of your hyperthyroidism , how are you doing with the synthroid ? are you doing okay ?","45":"you're taking it regularly ?","46":"yes . okay . and any fatigue ? weight gain ? anything like that that you've noticed ?","47":"okay . and just in general , you know , i know that we've kind of battled with your arthritis .","48":"you know , it's hard because you ca n't take certain medications 'cause of your kidney transplant .","49":"so other than your knees , any other joint pain or anything like that ?","50":"okay . all right . now i know the nurse did a review of systems sheet when you checked in . any other symptoms i might have missed ?","51":"no headaches ?","52":"anything like that w- ... okay . all right . well , i wan na go ahead and do a quick physical exam , all right ? hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . so here in the office , your vital

, okay ?","54":"all right . does that hurt ?","55":"okay , so on physical examination , on your heart exam , i do appreciate a little two out of six systolic ejection murmur-","56":". which we've heard in the past . okay , so that seems stable . on your knee exam , there is some edema and some erythema of your right knee , but your left knee looks fine , okay ? um , you do have some pain to palpation of the right knee and some decreased range of motion , um , on exam , okay ? so what does that mean ? so we'll go ahead and we'll see if we can take a look at some of these things . i know that they did an x-ray before you came in , okay ?","57":"so let's take a look at that .","58":"hey , dragon , show me the right knee x-ray . so here's the r- here's your right knee x-ray . this basically shows that there's good bony alignment . there's no acute fracture , which is not surprising , based on the history .","59":"okay ? hey , dragon , show me the labs . and here , looking at your lab results , you know , your white blood cell count is not elevated , which is good . you know , we get concerned about that in somebody who's immunocompromised .","60":"and it looks like your kidney function is also very good . so i'm , i'm very happy about that .","61":"okay ? so i just wan na go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you .","62":"so for your knee pain , i think that this is an acute exacerbation of your arthritis , okay ? so i wan na go ahead and if ... and prescribe some ultram 50 milligrams every six hours as needed .","63":"okay ? i also wan na go ahead and just order an autoimmune panel , okay ? hey , dragon , order an autoimmune panel . and you know , i , i want , i want you to just take it easy for right now , and if your symptoms continue , we'll talk about further imaging and possibly referral to physical therapy , okay ?","64":"for your second problem , your hypothyroidism , i wan na go ahead and continue you on this ... on the synthroid , and i wan na go ahead and order some thyroid labs , okay ?","65":"hey , dragon , order a thyroid panel . and then for your last problem , the arthritis , you know , we just kinda talked about that . you know , it's gon na be a struggle for you because again , you ca n't take some of those anti-inflammatory medications because of your kidney transplant , so ...","66":"you know , let's see how we do over the next couple weeks , and again , we'll refer you to physical therapy if we need to , okay ?","67":"you have any questions ?","68":"doctor: okay . hey , dragon , finalize the note

signs today . hey , dragon ? show me the blood pressure . yeah , so your blood pressure's a little high today . that's probably because you're in some pain , um , but let ... let me just take a listen to your heart and lungs , and i'll let you know what i find , okay ?","84":"okay , so on ... on physical exam , you do have some , uh , cda tenderness on the right-hand side , meaning that you're tender when i ... when i pound on that .","85":"um , and your abdomen also feels a little tender . you have some tenderness of the palpation of the right lower quadrant , but other than that , your heart sounds nice and clear and your lungs are clear as well . so let's go ahead and take a look at some of your results , okay ?","86":"hey , dragon ? show me the creatinine . so we ... we drew a creatinine when you came in here because i was concerned about the kidney stones . it ... it is uh ... it is up slightly , which might suggest that you have a little bit of a obstruction there of one-","87":". of the stones . okay ? hey , dragon . show me the abdominal x-rays . okay , and there might be a question of a ... uh , of a stone there lower down , uh , but we'll wait for the official read there . so the , uh , abdominal x-rays show a possible kidney stone , okay ?","88":"so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you . so , for your first problem , your back pain , i think you're having a recurrence of your kidney stones . so i wan na go ahead and order a ct scan without contrast of your abdomen and pelvis . okay ?","89":"and i'm also gon na order you some ultram 50 milligrams as needed every six hours for pain . does that sound okay ?","90":"hey , dragon ? order ultram 50 milligrams every six hours as needed for pain . and i want you to push fluids and

uh , we have you on the protonix 40 milligrams a day . do you need a refill of that ?","92":"okay . hey , dragon ? order a refill of protonix 40 milligrams daily . okay . so the nurse will be in soon

right . so , on your physical exam , everything seems fine .","126":"on your heart exam , i do appreciate a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past-","127":". so that's stable .","128":"on your back exam , you do have some pain to palpation of the lumbar 5 or lumbar spine-","129":"at the level of l5 .","130":"you have , you know , decreased range of motion with flexion and extension , and , um , you have a positive straight leg raise . uh , for your strength , you do have a 4 out of 5 on your right and 5 out of 5 on your left . so , what does that mean ? what does all that mean ? so , that basically means that , you know , i , i think that you probably , you know , have injured your , your back with a muscle strain , but we're gon na look at some of your results , okay ?","131":"hey , dragon , show me the back x-ray . so , in reviewing the results of your back x-ray , this is a normal x-ray of your lumbar spine . there's good boney alignment . i do n't see any abnormality there , which is not surprising based on the history , okay ? hey , dragon , show me the diabetic labs . and this is just ... i just wanted to check your last , uh , diabetic labs that we did on you . uh , it looks like your hemoglobin a1c has been a little high at 8 . i'd like to see that a little bit lower around 7 , okay ?","132":"um , so , let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you . um , so , for your first problem , i think you have an acute lumbar , um , strain .","133":"and i wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day , and i'd like to refer you to physical therapy to kind of strengthen that area . now , if you're still having symptoms , i wan na go ahead and , uh , order an mri-","134":".

just continue you on your current medications , your lisinopril and your lasix . now , do you need a refill-","139":"of the lisinopril ?","140":"okay . hey , dragon , order a refill of lisinopril 20 milligrams once a day . and so , the nurse will come in . she's gon na help you get checked out . i wan na see you again in a couple weeks , okay ?","141":"um , any questions ?","142":"doctor: okay . hey , dragon , finalize the note .","143":"hey , ms. hill . nice to see you .","144":"hey , dragon , i'm seeing ms. hill . she's a 41-year-old female , and what brings you in today ?","145":"what did

. and no other injuries ? just the finger ?","150":"so you would've escaped this accident without any injuries ?","151":"okay . um , so four days of right middle finger pain-","152":". after a motor vehicle accident .","153":"all right . um , let's look at your x-ray . hey , dragon , show me the last x-ray . so what i'm seeing here is on the tip of this middle finger , you actually have a fracture . so you have a distal phalanx fracture in the middle finger . very ...","154":"very interesting . let me check it out . um , so does it hurt when i push right here ?","155":"and does that hurt ?","156":"what about down here ?","157":"okay . so generally , your exam is normal other than you've got tenderness over your distal phalanx of your right middle finger . um , so your diagnosis is distal phalanx fracture of the middle finger or the third finger . and i'm gon na put you on a little bit of pain medicine just to help , just , like , two days' worth . okay , so tramadol , 50 milligrams , every six hours as needed for pain . i'm gon na dispense eight of those .","158":"and then , um , i'm gon na put you in a finger splint and have you come back in two weeks to get a follow-up x-ray . any questions for me ?","159":"it will be okay . so you have atrial fibrillation .","160":"you take digoxin . all right . any other questions for me ?","161":"doctor: you're welcome

ups ?","171":"okay . great . all right . and then , you know , how about your reflux ? we had placed you on , um , omeprazole , you know , to help with some of those symptoms and i know that you were gon na do some dietary modifications . how are you doing with that ?","172":"you're throwing up in the morning ?","173":"like , just , like , reflux into your throat or are you actually vomiting ?","174":"okay . that's a problem .","175":"all right . well , um , let's talk about any other symptoms that you might have . have you had any abdominal pain ? um , diarrhea ? um , do you feel like

vital signs . all right . well , your , your vital signs here look quite good . all right . so , i'm , i'm reassured by that . i'm just gon na check out your heart and lungs and your belly and , and l- let you know what i find , okay ?","183":"all right . so , on physical examination , you know , everything looks good . your heart sounds good . your lungs sound good . you know , on your abdominal exam , you do have some pain to your right upper quadrant when i press on it , um , and there's no rebound or guarding and there's no peritoneal signs and your right knee does show a little bit of , uh , an effusion there and there's , uh , some slight pain to palpation and some decreased range of motion . so what does that mean , you know ? that means that you have some findings on your belly exam that concern me about your gall bladder , okay ? so , we'll have to look into that and then , um , your right knee looks a little swollen , but you know , we know you have some arthritis there , okay ?","184":"let's take a look at some of your results . hey , dragon , show me the autoimmune panel . hey , dragon , show me the autoimmune labs . okay . so looking at your autoimmune panel here ,

right knee x-ray . so , looking here at your right knee x-ray , you know , there's no fracture or anything , but you know , it does show that you do have that residual arthritis there , um , that we're , you know , we're working on improving so that we do n't have to do some type of surgery or intervention , okay ?","186":"so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you , okay ? so , for your first problem , um , your reflux and your nausea and vomiting , uh , i wan na go ahead and get a right upper quadrant ultrasound to rule out any gallstones , okay ? um , and then i'm gon na check some labs on you . okay ?","187":"i want you to continue on the omeprazole , 40 milligrams , once a day and continue with those dietary modifications . um , for your second problem , your gout , um , you know , everything seems controlled right now . let's continue you on the allopurinol , 100 milligrams , once a day . um , do you need a refill of that ?","188":"hey , dragon , order

activities of daily living ? do you exercise , go to the store , that type of thing ?","202":"okay . and i know that you've had a coronary artery bypass grafting at the young age of 27 , so how's that going ?","203":"okay . all right , well , let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam . um , so looking at you , you do n't appear in any distress . um , your neck , there's no thyroid enlargement . uh , your heart i hear a three out of six , systolic ejection murmur , uh , that's stable . your lungs otherwise sound clear . your abdomen is soft , and you do have some pain to palpation of your lumbar spine . uh , and you've had decreased flexion of your back . uh , your lower extremity strength is good , and there's no edema . so let's go ahead and look at some of your results . hey ,

medication if you , if you get some pain periodically with activity . how do you feel about that ? do you need some pain medication ?","205":"okay . hey , dragon , order physical therapy referral . and then in terms of your depression , we talked about increasing your prozac , so we'll increase it from 20 milligrams to 40 milligrams . it's just one tablet once a day .","206":"um , and i'll send those to your pharmacy . does that sound okay ?","207":"hey , dragon , order prozac , 40 milligrams , once a day . and then in terms of your ... the heart bypass that you've had ... let's go ahead and

the past , okay ? and on your lower extremities , i do notice some trace to one plus pitting edema in your ankles , which is probably from the salt intake , okay ?","228":"so , we'll talk about that . i wan na just look at some of your results , okay ?","229":"hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram . so , i just wanted to go over the results of your last echocardiogram , that was about six

that's that slight heart murmur i heard in your exam , okay ? hey , dragon , show me the hemoglobin . and here , this is the hemoglobin that i was referring to . it's low at 8.2 , okay ? so , we'll have to talk a little bit about that , all right ? so , let me go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you , okay ? so , for you first problem this new anemia , uh , i wan na go ahead and send off some more labs and anemia profile , just to see exactly what type of anemia we're dealing with . i also wan na go and refer you back to the gastroenterologist for another evaluation , okay ? hey , dragon , order referral to gastroenterology . so , they're gon na do , uh , probably do an endoscopy and another colonoscopy on you . um , but again , i wan na send off those labs just to make sure that it's not something else , okay ?","230":"for your next problem your congestive heart failure , um , i do think you're retaining a little bit of fluid . so , i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some lasix 40 milligrams once a day . i want you to continue you on your toprol 50 milligrams daily . and as well your , as well , as your lisinopril 10 milligrams a day . i really want you to watch your salt intake , okay ? get a scale , weigh yourself every day . and call me if your weight starts to go up , okay ?","231":"'cause i might need to give you more diuretic .","232":"and for your last problem your kidney stones , uh , i think everything seems to be fine right at this time . again , continue to watch your diet and stay hydrated . um , and i know that might be a little difficult with the diuretic , but do your best . uh , and give me a call if you have any question , okay ?","233":"all right . any questions right now ?","234":"doctor: okay , great . hey , dragon , finalize the note .","235":"hi , bryan . how are you ?","236":"all right , well , i know the nurse told you about dax . i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you , okay ?","237":"so bryan is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for prior discectomy , who presents with back pain . so , bryan , what happened to your back ?","238":"okay , on the lower right side of this back ?","239":"okay . those wives , always making you do stuff .","240":"and what day did this happen on ? how long ago ?","241":"five days ago .","242":"okay . all right . and , and what have you taken for the pain ?","243":"okay . all right . and have you had any symptoms like pain in your legs or numbing or tingling ?","244":"okay , just the pain in your back .","245":"okay , and any problems with your bladder or your bowels ?","246":"i know the nurse said to review a symptom sheet when you checked in .","247":"and i know that you were endorsing the back pain . any other symptoms ? chest pain ? shortness of breath ? abdominal pain ?","248":"nausea ? vomiting ?","249":"okay . all right . well , let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam . hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . so your vital signs here in the office look really good . you do n't have a fever . your blood pressure's nice and controlled . so that ... that's good . i'm just gon na check out your back and your heart and your lungs , okay ?","250":"okay , so on physical examination , you know , your heart sounds great . there's ... it's a regular rate and rhythm . your lungs are nice and clear . on your back exam , you do have some pain to palpation of the right lumbar spine , uh , in the paraspinal muscles along with decreased flexion and extension of the back , and you have a positive straight leg on the right . or positive straight leg raise on the right , uh , but your strength is good bilaterally in your lower extremities . so that means that i think that you've injured your back .","251":"uh , but , you know , i think it's something that we can , we can fix , okay ?","252":"i do n't think so .","253":"let's took at some of your results . hey , dragon , show me the back x-ray . so this is an x-ray of your lumbar spine . you know , there's good bony , bony alignment . i do n't see any fracture or anything like that . so that's a good sign . um , hey , dragon . show me the labs . and your labs here all look good , so i'm , i'm happy to see that . uh , so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you , okay ?","254":"so i ... my assessment for your first problem , your back pain . i think you have a lumbar strain . i do n't think that anything else is going on , but i wan na go ahead and order an mri-","255":"just to be sure .","256":"okay ? and then i'm gon na prescribe you some meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day along with some ultram , 50 milligrams every four hours as needed , okay ?","257":"um , and then we'll go ahead and refer you to some physical therapy once we get the mri results back , okay ?","258":"you can stop the ibuprofen .","259":"you can take tylenol if you want .","260":"you know to call me if , if you need anything .","261":"any questions , uh , bryan ?","262":"doctor: okay . hey , dragon , finalize the note .","263":"hi keith , how are you ?","264":"and , uh , so keith is a 58-year-old male here for evaluation of high blood sugar . so , what happened ? ha- have you just been taking your blood sugars at home and noticed that they're really high ? or ?","265":"have- ... what have they been running , in like the 200's or 300's ?","266":"they've been running in the 300's ? and tell me about your diet . have you been eating anything to spark- ... spike them up ?","267":"okay . have you- ... go ahead .","268":"okay and what do you con- consider the same ? are you eating lots of sugar ? like , teas and coffees and-","269":"okay , all right . and how about , um , like any added sugars into any kind of processed foods or anything like that ?","270":"from what ?","271":"fruit , okay .","272":"all right . um , and have you been feeling sick recently ? have you had any fever or chills ?","273":"body aches , joint pain ?","274":"multiple joints , or just one joint ?","275":"your right knee ?","276":"okay . and what happened ?","277":"okay , all right . um , and how about any nausea or vomiting or belly pain ?","278":"okay . all right . and no burning when you urinate or anything like that ?","279":"okay . all right . so , um ... you know , i know that you've had this reflux in the past . how are you doing with that ? are you still having a lot of reflux symptoms or do you feel like it's better since we've put you on the protonix ?","280":"okay , all right . and i know you have this history of congestive heart failure . have you noticed any recent , uh , weight gain or fluid retention ?","281":"no ? okay . um , and any problems sleeping while laying flat ?","282":"okay , but even then , you're flat .","283":"okay . all right . and i know that we had an issue with your right rotator cuff , is that okay ?","284":"okay , all right . all right , well let's go ahead and we'll do a quick physical exam . so ... feeling your neck , i do feel like your thyroid's a bit enlarged here . um , your heart is nice and regular . your lungs are clear . your abdomen , um , is nice and soft . your right knee shows that you have some erythema and- and an insect bite with associated fluctuants . and , um , you have some lower extremity edema on the right hand side . so let's go ahead and look at some of your results . i know the nurse had reported these things and we ordered some labs on you before you came in . hey dragon , show me the vital signs . okay , well your- your vital signs look good , which is good . hey dragon , show me the lyme titer . okay , so , you know , your lyme titer is a little elevated , so i think we'll have to go ahead and- and look into that a little bit , okay ?","285":"that can certainly cause your blood sugar to be elevated . um , hey dragon , uh , show me the rapid strep . and you also have , uh , positive for strep . so i think we have some reasons as to why your blood sugar is so high . so my impression of you , you know , you have this hyperglycemia , which is probably related to some infections going on in your body . um , from a- a- a rapid strep standpoint we're gon na go ahead and treat you with penicillin or , i'm sorry , amoxicillin , 500 milligrams , three times a day . uh , make sure you take it all , even if you start feeling better , okay ?","286":"hey dragon , order amoxicillin , 500 milligrams , three times a day for 10 days . um ... okay . and from ... , and from all- ... a positive lyme titer aspect , we should go ahead and order a western blot , just pcr to see if you have any , um , to see if it's actually acute lyme , okay ?","287":"okay . um , hey dragon , order a western blot pcr for lyme . okay . all right . well we'll go ahead and , um , the nurse will come in soon and she'll set you up with these tests , okay ?","288":"yes it is , yeah .","289":"have what ?","290":"yeah , i do n't think so . have you eaten meat over the last couple of days ?","291":"okay . well i- ... it's , you know , your blood sugar's elevated so you might be having an inflammatory response to that , but we'll go ahead and order some tests to look into it , okay ?","292":"all right . call me if anything happens , okay ?","293":"doctor: all right . hey dragon , finalize the note .","294":"hi , roger . how are you ?","295":"good to see you . are you ready to get started ?","296":"roger is a 62 year old male here for emergency room follow-up for some chest pain . so , roger , i heard you went to the er for some chest discomfort .","297":"okay . and had you ever had that before ?","298":"okay . and-","299":"okay . and , um , how are you feeling since then ?","300":"okay . and no other symptoms since then ?","301":"okay . and any family history of any heart disease ?","302":"okay . all right . all right . and , um , you know , i know that you had had the , uh , knee surgery-","303":"a couple months ago . you've been feeling well since then ?","304":"okay . and no chest pain while you were , you know , doing exercises in pt for your knee ?","305":"okay . all right . and in terms of your high blood pressure , do you know when you had the chest pain if your blood pressure was very high ? did they say anything in the emergency room ?","306":"okay . and , and i see here that it was about 180 over 95 when you went into the emergency room . has it been running that high ?","307":"okay . all right . all right . well , let's go ahead and we'll do a quick physical exam . so , looking at you , you know , i'm feeling your neck . i do feel a little enlarged thyroid here that's not tender . you have a carotid bruit on the right hand side and , uh , your lungs are clear . your heart is in a regular rate and rhythm , but i do hear a three out of six systolic ejection murmur . your abdomen is nice and soft . uh , there is the healed scar on your right knee from your prior knee surgery , and there's no lower extremity edema . so , let's look at some of your results , okay ?","308":"hey , dragon , show me the blood pressure . yeah . and here , your blood pressure's still high , so we'll have to talk about that . um , hey , dragon , show me the ekg . so , here you- that's good , your , your ekg-","309":". here is normal , so that's , that's very encouraging . um , i know that they had the echocardiogram , so let's look at that . hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram . okay . so , looking at this , you know , you do have a little bit of a , a low pumping function of your heart , which , you , you know , can happen and we'll have to look into that , okay ?","310":"so , you know , my impression is is that you have this episode of chest pain , um , that could be related to severe hypertension or it could be related to some heart disease . so , what i'd like to go ahead and do is , number one , we'll put you on , um ... we'll change your blood pressure regimen . we'll put you on carvedilol , 25 milligrams twice a day . that helps with coronary disease as well as your pumping function of your heart . um , i wan na go ahead and order a cardiac catheterization on you and make sure that we do n't have any blockages in your heart arteries responsible for the chest pain . for the high blood pressure , we're gon na add the carvedilol and i want you to continue your lisinopril 10 milligrams a day and i wan na see , uh , how your blood pressure does on that regimen , okay ?","311":"all right . so , the nurse will be in soon and i'll ... we'll schedule that cath for you , okay ?","312":"doctor: hey , dragon , finalize the note .","313":"hi , joseph . how are you ?","314":"good to see you . are you ready to get started ?","315":"okay . joseph is a 59 year old male here for routine follow-up of his chronic problems . so , joseph , how have you been doing ?","316":"okay . all right . well , let's start with your diabetes . so , your diet's been good ?","317":"okay . all right . um , but , ha- ha- have you ... let's just talk about your review of systems . have you had any dizziness , lightheadedness , fever , chills ?","318":"okay . any chest pain , shortness of breath , or belly pain ?","319":"okay . all right . and , how about any joint pain or muscle aches ?","320":"okay . all right . um , and , in terms of your asthma , you just said that you were short of breath running up and down the stairs , so , um , do , how often have you been using your inhaler over the past year ?","321":"okay . and , um- and , in terms of your activities of daily living , are you able to exercise or anything like-","322":"okay . all right . and then , your depression , you said it's ... how's that going ? i know we have you on the , on the prozac 20mg a day . are you taking that ? are you having a lot of side effects from that ?","323":"okay . all right . are you interested in resuming the medication , or would you like to try a different one ?","324":"okay . all right . okay , well , let's , let's go ahead and we'll do a quick physical exam . so , looking at you , you're in , in no apparent distress . i'm feeling your neck . there's no cervical lymphadenopathy . your thyroid seems not enlarged . and , listening to your lungs , you do have some bilateral expiratory wheezing that's very faint , and your heart is a regular rate and rhythm . your abdomen is soft , and uh , your lower extremities have no edema . so , let's go ahead and look at some of your results . hey , dragon , show me the pfts . okay , so your , your pfts , that , those are your breathing studies , and those look quite good , so i know that you're wheezing right now , but , um , you know , i think that we can add , add , um , a regimen to that to help , to help you with your , um , exacerbations during the , the summer months , okay ?","325":"and then , let's look at your ... hey , dragon ? show me the hemoglobin a1c . okay , so your a1c , you're right , you know , over the past couple months is , you know , your blood sugar's probably been running a little high , so , you know , i know that you're gon na get back on your diet regimen , but , um , for right now , let's go ahead and we'll increase your metformin , okay ?","326":"um , and then , hey , dragon ? show me the chest x-ray . okay , good , and your chest x-ray looks fine , so we know that there's no pneumonia there .","327":"and , it's just is all just from your asthma . so , you know , my impression of you at this time , you know , from a diabetes standpoint , let's , let's increase the metformin to 1,000 mg twice a day . um , and , we will get a repeat hemoglobin a1c in three months , and i want you to continue to monitor your blood sugars at home . from an asthma standpoint , let's continue you on the albuterol , two puffs , uh , every four to six hours as needed , and we'll add symbicort , two puffs twice a day during the summer , to kind of help prevent those exacerbations . and then , from a depression standpoint , we'll go ahead and start you on a different medication , zoloft , um , 25 mg once a day and see how you tolerate that . does that sound okay ?","328":"all right . so , the nurse will be in soon , and she'll get you situated with all of that , okay ?","329":"it was good to see you .","330":"doctor: hey , dragon ? finalize the note .","331":"hi , john , how are you doing ?","332":"good to see you too . so i know the nurse told you about dax , i'd like to tell dax a little about you .","333":"so john is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for anxiety and epilepsy who presents with an abnormal lab finding . so , john , um , i , uh , was notified by the emergency room that you , um , had a really high blood sugar and you were in there with , uh ... they had to treat you for that , what was going on ?","334":"okay , yeah , i had gone through your hemoglobin a1c's and you know , they were borderline in the past but-","335":"-i guess , you know , i guess they're high now so how are you feeling since then ?","336":"okay , did they put you on medication ?","337":"okay , all right . i think they have here metformin ?","338":"all right , um , and , um , in terms of your anxiety , i'm sure that this did n't help much-","339":"how are you doing with that ?","340":"okay ? um , how about your epilepsy , any seizures recently ?","341":"okay . all right , well you know i wanted to just go ahead and do , um , a quick review of the systems , i know you did a cheat with the nurse-","342":"any chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , dizzy- dizziness ?","343":"okay , any recent fever , chills ?","344":"okay . and all right , let's go ahead do a quick physical exam . hey , dragon , show me the vitals . so looking here at your vital signs today , um , they look really good . so i'm just gon na go ahead and take a listen to your heart and lungs .","345":"okay , so on physical examination , you know , everything seems to look really good , um lungs are nice and clear , your heart's at a regular rate and rhythm . you do have some trace pitting edema to your lower extremities so what that means is that it looks like you might be retaining a little bit of fluid-","346":"um , did they give you a lot of fluid in the emergency room ?","347":"okay , all right , so it might just be from that . okay , well let's look at some of your results . hey , dragon , show me the glucose . okay , so yeah , you know i know that they just checked your blood sugar now and it was 162 and you know , what ... you know , did you eat before this ?","348":"okay , all right . hey , dragon , show me the diabetes labs . yeah , so your hemoglobin a1c here is is 8 , you know last time we had seen it , it was about 6 and we had n't put you on medications so , um , i think it's something we'll have to talk about , okay ?","349":"um , so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem , this newly diagnosed diabetes . um , you know , i want to continue on the metformin 500 mg twice a day . we'll probably increase that over time .","350":"i'm gon na go ahead and order hemoglobin a1c for the future okay ?","351":"um for your second problem , your anxiety . it sounds like you know you might have , you know , some issues leading into the winter . how do you feel about that ?","352":"okay , all right , and so for your last ish issue , your- your epilepsy , you know , i think you saw your neurologist about three months ago , you must be due to see her again some time soon ?","353":"and we'll just continue you on the keppra , okay ?","354":"any questions ?","355":"doctor: okay , um , hey , dragon , finalize the note .","356":"hi , louis . how are you ?","357":"it's good to see you as well . are you ready to get started ?","358":"louis is a 58-year-old male here for follow up from an emergency room visit . so , louis , what happened ?","359":"okay . all right . and how have you been feeling since that time ?","360":"okay . and have you been taking all of your meds for your heart failure ?","361":"okay . and , and you're watching your diet , you're avoiding salt . have you had anything salty ?","362":"okay . all right . um , and i know that they removed a cataract from your eye-","363":". a couple of , like couple months ago . that's been fine ?","364":"okay . so , no vision problems .","365":"okay . and you had a skin cancer removed about five months ago as well . you've had a lot going on .","366":"okay . all right . um , so , why do n't we go ahead and we'll do a quick physical-","367":". exam . hey , dragon , show me the blood pressure . so , here , your blood pressure is a little high .","368":"um , so , you know , i did see a report in the emergency room that your blood pressure was high there as well .","369":"so , we'll have to just kind of talk about that . uh , but let's go ahead and we'll examine you .","370":"okay . so , you know , looking at you , your neck is very supple . i do n't appreciate any fibular venous distention . your heart is a regular rate and rhythm , no murmur . your lungs have some fine crackles in them , bilaterally . and you have trace lower extremity edema in both legs . so , what that means , essentially , is that you may have some extra fluid on board , um , from eating salty foods-","371":". along with this history of your congestive heart failure . but , let's go ahead and look at some of your results . hey , dragon , show me the ecg . so , this is , uh , a s- a stable ecg for you . this basically shows that you have some left ventricular hypertrophy which caused your congestive heart failure . um , let's go ahead and review your echocardiogram . hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram . so , in reviewing the results of your echocardiogram , it shows that your pumping function of your heart is a little low , uh , but it's stable . and , you know , i think that we know this and we have you on the appropriate-","372":"medication therapy . and then , i just wan na be reminded about , um , the results of your skin biopsy . hey , dragon , show me the skin biopsy results . okay . and in reviewing the pathology report for your skin cancer-","373":". you know , it looks like they got all of that and everything's fine .","374":"so , you know , my impression of you at this time , for the shortness of breath that you had in the emergency department , i think it was an exacerbation of your heart failure . and you probably had some , what we call , dietary indiscretion , you ate some salty food which made you retain some fluid .","375":"so , for that , i'm going to prescribe you , you know , an extra dose of lasix 80 milligrams , once a day . and , um , we're going to , uh , put you on some carvedilol 25 milligrams , twice a day . okay ?","376":"um , and i think from a , a cataract surgery standpoint and your skin cancer removal , everything seems to be fine and you're doing well , so i do n't think we need to adjust any of those medications .","377":"okay ? hey , dragon , order lasix 80 milligrams , once a day . hey , dragon , order carvedilol 25 milligrams , twice a day . okay . and the nurse will come in and she'll see you soon . okay ?","378":"doctor: hey , dragon , finalize the note .","379":"thanks , rachel . nice , nice to meet you .","380":"um , as my nurse told you , we're using dax . so i'm just gon na tell dax a little bit about you .","381":"so rachel is a 48-year-old female here for shortness of breath . she has a history of depression , smoking , and chronic back pain . so tell me about this shortness of breath .","382":"mm-hmm .","383":"right .","384":"okay . and anything else change recently ? like , have you changed lifestyle , like you're exercising more than you used to , having any allergies , anything like that ?","385":"the covid 15 . yeah . now last time i saw you , you were smoking two packs a day . how much are you smoking now ?","386":"just couple cigarettes a day ?","387":"we're getting close .","388":"that's awesome .","389":"that's great news . um , and then how's your depression doing ?","390":"okay . and you had been taking the effexor for your depression . are you still taking that ?","391":"okay , great . and then , um the chronic back pain , we've been giving you the gabapentin neurontin for that . is that helping control the pain ?","392":"right . what do you do when it's really bad ?","393":"okay . and you had talked about doing yoga . are you doing yoga anymore ?","394":"okay . okay . well , um , you know , said ... you said you were coming in with shortness of breath , so we sent you to get some pulmonary function tests .","395":"so let's just look at those . hey , dragon , show me the pulmonary function tests . okay , so it looks like ... , it's interesting . it says that you might be having a little bit of asthma or , uh , copd . and if you are , we'll talk about that .","396":"let's look at our x-ray . hey , dragon , show me the most recent x-ray . okay , i said it wrong . hey , dragon , show me the most recent chest x-ray . okay , this is interesting . your ... kind of your diaphragm is a little bit flatter , and we'll see that in some , uh , copd , which happens with smokers often . so let's just do a quick physical exam . i know my nurse did the review of systems with you . is there anything else bothering you that we need to talk about today ?","397":"okay . great . let's do the exam . all right , so your physical exam looks pretty normal other than you've got kind of these mild wheezes in all your lung fields . and so i think you do have copd from your pulmonary function tests , your x-ray , and that . so i'm gon na diagnose you with copd . chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . it means you're not able to exhale appropriately .","398":"so we're gon na put you on a medicine called combivent . okay , you're gon na do two puffs twice a day . it's gon na help open up your lungs . it's an inhaler .","399":"i'm also gon na prescribe albuterol , which you use when you get really short of breath . it's like a rescue thing .","400":"um , and then i'm gon na prescribe some steroids to help , also some prednisone . so let me just order those .","401":"hey , dragon , order combivent , uh , two puffs twice a day . order albuterol , two puffs as needed . and order , uh , prednisone uh taper pack . okay , so and then it sounds like your depression's stable , so we're not gon na change anything . you're gon na keep taking the effexor . um , do yoga for depression and your back pain , so for your back pain , stay on the neurontin , and we just wo n't do anything different . any questions for me .","402":"doctor: perfect . hey , dragon , finalize the note . why do n't you ...","403":"hi , edward , how are you ?","404":"i'm doing okay .","405":"so , i know the nurse told you about dax . i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you .","406":"edward is a 59 year old male with a past medical history significant for depression , hypertension and prior rotator cuff repair who presents for followup of his chronic problems . so , edward , it's been a little while since i saw you .","407":"how are you doing ?","408":"good . okay . so , you know , the last time we spoke , you know , you were trying to think of some new strategies to manage your depression . you did n't wan na go on medication because you're already on a bunch of meds .","409":"so , how are you doing with that ?","410":"okay , so , you do n't wan na , you do n't feel the need to start any medications at this time ?","411":"yeah , absolutely .","412":"yeah . all right . and then , in terms of your high blood pressure , how are you doing with that ? i know we , we were kind of struggling with it la- six months ago . how are you doing ?","413":"yeah . so , i love burgers and wine too .","414":"so , i get it . um , okay , so , and you're taking the norvasc ?","415":"okay . um , and , you're checking your blood pressures at home , it sounds like ?","416":"okay . all right . and then , i know that you had that rotator cuff repaired about eight months ago . how are you doing ?","417":"okay . are you still seeing the physical therapist in the center , or are you just doing exercises at home ?","418":"okay . all right . great . all right . well , i know you did a review of systems sheet when you checked in .","419":"and , you know , it seems like you're doing well . any symptoms at all ? any nasal congestion or chest pain , shortness of breath , anything ?","420":"okay . all right . all right . maybe that has to do with some of the salt intake you're , you're eating .","421":"all right . well , i wan na go ahead and do a quick physical exam , okay ?","422":"hey , dragon ? show me the blood pressure . yeah , so , your blood pressure's a little elevated today , 156 over 94 .","423":"you know , you could be a little happy to see me . i do n't know . um , but let's look at some of the readings . hey , dragon ? show me the blood pressure readings . yeah , so , they've been a , running a little high over the past couple months .","424":"so , we'll have to just kinda talk about that , okay ?","425":"i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart and lungs , and i'll let you know what i find , okay ?","426":"okay . all right . so , on physical exam , you know , everything looks good . on your heart exam , i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur , but we've heard that in the past .","427":"so , that seems stable to me . um , on your lung exam , everything sounds nice and clear , and on your lower extremity exam , i do appreciate , you know , 1 to 2+ pitting edema in your legs , okay ? so , we'll have to just talk a little bit about your diet and decreasing the salt intake , okay ?","428":"so , let me just look at some of your results , okay ? hey , dragon ? show me the labs . so , looking here at your lab results , everything looks really good . you know , your creatinine , that's your kidney function , that looks stable . everything looks good from that standpoint . hey , dragon ? show me the ekg . and , looking here at your ekg , everything , you know , looks fine . there's no evidence of any coronary artery disease . it's a nice , normal ekg , which is good .","429":"so , let me just talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you . okay ? so , from a depression standpoint , it's , you know , your first problem , i think that that sounds like you're doing really well managing it . you know , you have good strategies . it sounds like you have a good support system , um , and i agree . i do n't think you need to start on any medication at this time , but you said before , you know you can call me , okay ?","430":"for your second problem , your hypertension , i , i do n't believe it's well controlled at this time . so , i wan na go ahead and , you know , increase the norvasc up to 10 mg a day , and i wan na go ahead and order an echocardiogram and a lipid panel , okay ?","431":"hey , dragon ? order an echocardiogram . and , for your third problem , your rotator cuff repair , i , i think you're doing really well with that . i would just continue with the exercises and , uh , i do n't think we need to intervene upon that anymore . it sounds like that's pretty much resolved , okay ?","432":"do you have any questions about anything ?","433":"doctor: okay , great . hey , dragon ? finalize the note .","434":"hello , mrs . peterson .","435":"you're here for your hip today , or your- your leg today ?","436":"hey , dragon . i'm seeing mrs . peterson , here , she's a 43-year-old patient . she's here for left leg pain . right leg pain , right leg pain ?","437":"um so , what happened to you ?","438":"did you get a strike ?","439":"terrific , terrific . so , did it swell up on you ?","440":"what about bruising ?","441":"have- have you been able to walk on it ?","442":"sore to walk on ?","443":"um , and going upstairs or downstairs , does that bother you at all ?","444":"okay . um , it looks like you had a history of atopic eczema in your past ?","445":"okay . and you take uh- uh , fluocinonide for that ?","446":"okay . and , it looks like you have a pre- previous surgical history of a colectomy ? what happened there ?","447":"okay , let me examine you . does it hurt when i push on your leg like that ?","448":"okay . if i lift your leg up like this , does that hurt ?","449":"so , on my exam , you have some significant tenderness to the lateral aspect of your um right upper leg . you do n't seem to have any pain or tenderness with flexion or extension of your um your lower leg . um , are you taking anything for it right now ?","450":"okay . well , my impression is that you- you probably have a contusion , but let's take a look at your x-ray first . hey , dragon . show me the x-ray . yeah , so if you look at this , this is a normal femur . um , really do n't see any evidence of a fracture or any swelling , so it's essentially , a normal x-ray . so , what we're going to do is , i'm going to start you on um an anti-inflammatory . it's going to be mobic 15 milligrams uh , once a day . i want you to use some ice for the pain , um , and it should , honestly , just being a contusion , get better in the next week or so . if it's not getting better , of course , come on back and- and see me .","451":"doctor: hey , dragon . go ahead and um , pres- do the orders and um , procedures uh , as described . come with me , and uh , i'll get you checked out . dragon , go ahead and finish off the note .","452":"hi miss russell .","453":"nice to meet you-","454":"i'm well .","455":"hey dragon . i'm seeing miss russell . she's a 39-year-old female here for , what are you here for ?","456":"so severe right upper arm pain .","457":"and how did this happen ?","458":"mm-hmm , like right on your shoulder .","459":"that sounds like it hurt .","460":"um , so this happened , what ? like 12 hours ago now ?","461":"so less than a day .","462":"in severe pain .","463":"have you taken anything for the pain ?","464":"okay , what would you rate your pain ?","465":"nine out of 10 ?","466":"so like really severe ?","467":"have you used any ice ?","468":"okay . and do you have any medical problems ?","469":"okay . do you take any medicine for it ?","470":"okay . and any surgeries in the past ?","471":"all right . let's uh , let's look at your x-ray . hey dragon . show me the last radiograph . so this is looking at your right arm , and what i see is a proximal humerus fracture . so you kinda think of your humerus as a snow cone , and you knocked the top of the snow cone ? the top off the snow cone . um , so i'll be gentle but i want to examine your arm .","472":"all right . are you able to straighten your arm ?","473":"as long as you do n't move your shoulder .","474":"go ahead and bend . okay . so your exam is generally normal , meaning that the rest of your body is normal","475":"but you've got some swelling and erythema-","476":". on that right shoulder . you've got uh , tenderness over your right shoulder . you've got normal pulses , and everything else is normal . any numbness or tingling in that right arm ?","477":"okay . um , so what we're going to have to do- the good thing about um , these kinds of fractures is generally , they will heal up without surgery . um , but we have to put you in a sling that weighs your arm down and pulls it down . so we're going to put you in a long arm cast and a sling , and then we're gon na check you in two weeks to see if those bones have realigned and if they have n't , then we're gon na have to talk about doing surgery at that time .","478":"i'm going to prescribe you some pain medicine . we'll do lortab 500- lortab 5 milligram . um , you can take one to two tablets every uh , six hours as needed for pain . i'll give you 20 of those .","479":"and um , do you have any allergies to medicines ? i did n't ask .","480":"okay . um , hey dragon , go ahead and order any medications or procedures discussed . um , do you have any questions for me ?","481":"okay , great . why do n't you come with me , we'll get the tech to put the cast on .","482":"and we'll get you checked out .","483":"doctor: hey dragon , finalize the report .","484":"hi ms. hernandez , dr. fisher , how are you ?","485":"all right . so it's your right elbow ?","486":"okay . hey dragon , ms. hernandez is a 48-year-old female here for a right elbow . so , tell me what happened .","487":"okay . and when- when did this happen ?","488":"all right . and have you tried anything for it ? i mean ...","489":"okay , what makes it better or worse ?","490":"all right . uh , let's review your past medical history . uh ... looks like you've got a history of anaphylaxis , is that correct ?","491":"do you take any medications for it ?","492":"just epipen for anaphylaxis when you need it . um , and what surgeries have you had before ?","493":". yeah , no , uh , your , uh , neck surgery .all right . well let's , uh , examine you here for a second .so it's your , uh , this elbow right here ?","494":"and is it hurt- ... tender right around that area ?","495":"okay . can you flex it or can you bend it ?","496":"all right . and go ahead and straighten out as much as you can .","497":"all right .","498":"so there's some swelling there . and how about , uh , can you move your fingers okay ? does that hurt ?","499":"how about right over here ?","500":"okay . so on exam you've got some tenderness over your lateral epicondyle . uh , you have some swelling there and some redness . uh , you have some pain with flexion , extension of your elbow as well . uh , and you have some pain on the dorsal aspect of your- of your forearm as well . okay ? so let's look at your x-rays . hey dragon , show me the x-rays . all right . your x-ray of your elbow-it looks like , i mean , the bones are lined up properly . there's no fracture- . it , uh , there's a little bit of swelling there on the lateral elbow but i do n't see any fracture , so that's good . so , looking at the x-ray and looking at your exam , uh , my diagnosis here would be lateral epicondylitis , and this is basically inflammation of this area where this tendon in- inserts . and probably that happened when you were moving those boxes . so we'll try some motrin , uh , about 800 milligrams every six hours . uh , i'll give you a sling for comfort , just so you can use it if- if it's causing a lot of pain .","501":"and it should get better , uh , in about , you know , in a couple of days it should be improved . and if it does n't get better , give us a call and we'll see you some time next week . okay ? so we'll give you a sling , we'll give you the motrin , i'll give you about , uh , 30 , uh , uh , 30 , uh , uh , medications for that . uh , do you have any questions ?","502":"hey dragon , order the medications and the procedures . all right , why do n't you come with me and we'll get you signed out ?","503":"doctor: hey dragon , finalize the report .","504":"hi , vincent . how are you ?","505":"i'm good . so le- are you ready to get started ?","506":"okay . vincent is a 56-year-old male here with abnormal lab findings . so , i've heard you were in the er , vincent , and they found that you had a low hemoglobin .","507":"were you having some dizziness and some lightheadedness ?","508":"okay . and have you noticed bleeding from anywhere ?","509":"but no blood in your stools or-","510":". anything like that ?","511":"okay . and any type of weight loss or decreased appetite or night sweats ? coughs ?","512":"um , okay . and how about any abdominal pain ? fever , chills ?","513":"okay . all right . um , any nausea or vomiting ?","514":"okay . all right . um , well , how are you doing in terms of your knee replacement . i know you had that done last year . that's going okay ?","515":"okay . you're walking around without a problem ?","516":"all right .um , and i know a few years ago , you had , had that scare with the possible lung cancer , but then they did the biopsy and , and you've been fine .","517":"turned out to be benign .","518":"okay . great . all right . well , let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam . so looking at you , you do n't appear in any distress . your heart is regular . your lungs sound nice and clear . you have some tenderness to the right lower quadrant to palpation of your abdomen . your lower extremities have no edema . um , all right . well , let's go ahead and look at your labs , okay ?","519":"hey , dragon , show me the hemoglobin . yeah , so your hemoglobin is 8.2 , which is quite low for somebody of your height and weight , so we'll have to look into that a , a little bit further . i know that they did the endoscopy in the emergency room . hey , dragon , show me the endoscope results . good . so it looks like you had some gastritis , which is just inflammation of your stomach and they also found a slight polyp , which i know that they biopsied and the results are pending at this time . um , so , you may have had some bleeding from the gastritis . it's not usual for people to have bleeding from that . um , okay , well , hey , dragon , show me the anemia panel . okay . anyway , okay . well , vincent , i think , you know , in terms of , my impression of you is that you've had this newfound anemia and for that , i think that we should go ahead and put you on protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day to help with the gastritis . does that sound okay to you ?","520":"so that's just , uh , what we call a proton pump inhibitor which , uh , helps decrease the amount of acid secreted within your stomach .","521":"hey , hey , dragon , order protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day . and i'd like you to try to cut down on your caffeine 'cause that can also irritate your stomach . try not to take any ibuprofen and try to cut down on any alcohol intake , okay ?","522":"yeah . it always is . how about one , one , one eight-ounce cup a day ? okay ?","523":"um , and we'll go ahead and we'll see you in a couple weeks , okay ?","524":"i'm going through , uh , i'll also order another , uh , cbc on you . hey , dragon , order a complete blood count . all right . the nurse will be in soon . it's , you know , settle all that . i'll see you soon .","525":"doctor: hey , dragon , finalize the note .","526":"next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 . hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ?","527":"i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .","528":"anything new since your last visit ?","529":"okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?","530":"okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .","531":"yep , right here .","532":"yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .","533":"so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .","534":"maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .","535":"maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .","536":"i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .","537":"have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?","538":"okay , good .","539":"um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?","540":"okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...","541":"so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .","542":"chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .","543":"it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .","544":"yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .","545":"yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .","546":"all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?","547":"okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?","548":"all right .","549":"and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?","550":"okay . we might give you some of that .","551":"okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?","552":"all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .","553":"great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .","554":"all right , deep breath . all right , again .","555":"all right , sounds good .","556":"let me take a look at your feet and ankles .","557":"all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .","558":"now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .","559":"all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .","560":"okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .","561":"okay , great . let's see them .","562":"yeah , your alt was about 128 .","563":"yeah , this is much better .","564":"okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .","565":"um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .","566":"this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .","567":"yeah , that sounds like a plan .","568":"so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .","569":"so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .","570":"so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .","571":"does that make sense ?","572":"so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .","573":"um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .","574":"if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .","575":"correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .","576":"but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .","577":"of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .","578":"all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .","579":"perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .","580":"you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .","581":"but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .","582":"um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .","583":"and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?","584":"i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .","585":"since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .","586":"and you just apply it before intercourse .","587":"if you need some , uh , just let me know .","588":"okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .","589":"doctor: you're welcome . so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .","590":"this is philip gutierrez , date of birth 1\/12\/71 . he is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand . he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 polyregion , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger , because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of , quote , \" fds tendon , \" end quote . he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr , pa at that institution . at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4\/24\/2021 , which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint , partial-thickness tear of the right fds , and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact , as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact . his x-rays , four views of the right hand today , show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand , no soft tissue shadows of concern , no arthritis . hi , how are you , mr . gutierrez ?","591":"well , how can i help you today ?","592":"so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ?","593":"okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ?","594":"mm-hmm .","595":"yeah , i see that .","596":"what do you do for a living ?","597":"well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ?","598":"uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ?","599":"okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ?","600":"all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger . his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable now here ?","601":"all right , how about here ?","602":"okay , not as bad ?","603":"gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can .","604":"okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ?","605":"okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that .","606":"well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you .","607":"no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two .","608":"uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine .","609":"yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good .","610":"yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley .","611":"so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone .","612":"did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger .","613":"good . so , you do the shot , and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better . and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better .","614":"all right , so take advantage of that . you've got ta start moving the finger . you're not going to tear anything or break a bone , uh , because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you've got a stiff , sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part , and then you have to do all the stiff part .","615":"hmm . okay , so it was injured , and you had scar tissue . and then , you had post-traumatic inflammation . and so , this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like , , my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable , to where you can make some gains . and we actually might need to repeat this as well .","616":"yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive .","617":"so for mr . gutierrez , just put that he has a post-traumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of his right index finger , and the plan is steroid injection today , do a trigger injection , but i'm using a cc of betamethasone . so , mr . gutierrez , do you have , um , therapy scheduled or set up ?","618":"all right , well , i mean , you know that you need to move that finger , and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so i want you to move that finger , finger , but i think it would be , uh , beneficial for you to have an accountability , um , so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody .","619":"yeah , so i'll write you out , um , an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks , um , and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions .","620":"all right , well , i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure , and we'll , and i'll be back shortly .","621":"doctor: right trigger finger injection template . attempted to inject one cc of celestone with f- , a half a cc of lidocaine . however , the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle , with contortions of the hand , and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick . needle was withdrawn . the patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath . we attempted a second time for a similar injection using the same technique with one cc of celestone and half a cc of lidocaine . a small parma- , uh , palmar vein bled a scant amount , which was cleaned up and band-aid applied . reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger . recommended icing in it this evening , and taking ibuprofen .","622":"next patient is paul edwards , date of birth is january 15th 1962 . so he's a 59 year old hiv positive gentleman here for hypogonadism . patient was last seen on november 24th 2020 . his notable things are number one , he is on 1 milliliter every 10 days , uh , his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he's on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily so he takes all his pills just from me . um , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia which is ... which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500 . hey , how are you today ?","623":"i'm good .","624":"have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle ? you look trim .","625":"really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt . makes you look thin .","626":"so health wise , how is everything going ?","627":"that's great .","628":"okay , well that's good .","629":"yeah , i remember you telling me that .","630":"good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .","631":"please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .","632":"in and out .","633":"all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .","634":"okay , this is your cholesterol ?","635":"right .","636":"wow , that's remarkable .","637":"i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve .","638":"but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it .","639":"yeah , that's an unbelievable difference .","640":"absolutely .","641":"yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .","642":"your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .","643":"yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .","644":"so it just needs to be checked every year or so .","645":"yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .","646":"i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .","647":"well , your levels are high .","648":"well , i mean they were last time .","649":"i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?","650":"all right .","651":"that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .","652":"you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .","653":"i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .","654":"likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still .","655":"true . but right now i would not change your dose .","656":"make sense ?","657":"no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?","658":"for all of them ?","659":"all right , will do . i'm gon na get your prescriptions .","660":"patient is pamela cook . medical record number is 123546 . she's a 36-year-old female post bilateral reduction mammoplasty on 10-10 20-20 . hey , how are you ?","661":"i'm doing well . it's good to see you . how have you been ?","662":"great . how about your breasts , are they doing all right ?","663":"are you having any chills , fever , nausea , or vomiting ?","664":"good . all right . let's take a peek real quick .","665":"how's life otherwise ? pretty good ? nothing new ?","666":"okay . how's your family ?","667":"good . all right . i'm going to take a look at your breast now . if you would just open up your gown for me . everything looks good .","668":"how's your back pain ?","669":"any hard spots , lumps , or bumps that you've noticed ?","670":"okay , well . that that's good . uh , it's probably just the scar tissue , but everything looks good and you're healing wonderful , so .","671":"yeah , that scar did widen a little bit . let me take a closer look , hang on . this one widened a little too , ? the incisions are well healed though with no signs of infection or any redness on either breast , so i'm not concerned .","672":"i understand . um , you can close your gown now . the only thing that is really going to help out that is to uh , to cut it out and re-close it .","673":"and you do n't want that , ?","674":"um , you want to come back and revisit um , maybe six months ?","675":"okay . keep doing that twice a day . the gel is going to lighten the color a little bit , which is already pretty light . um , but , just in that area , and it's high tension , so it's going to rub a little bit .","676":"uh , i do see that . like i said , the only way to really fix that is to cut it out .","677":"um , let's take a look in six months and then we'll go from there . sound like a plan ?","678":"i know . um , i would n't do any revisions anyway for scar tissue until we're at least a year out anyway .","679":"so let's wait those six months . you can keep using uh , the mederma scar gel twice a day . massage and scar gel will help for the scars . um , you can put it on other scars too , if you need .","680":"um , so that's what i would do . let's just get some pictures today so we can keep up um , with them . and keep an eye on these scars and then we'll go from there .","681":"all right , well it's good to see you . i'm glad you're doing well .","682":"all right . well , i'm going to tell the front desk six months and we'll revisit those scars .","683":"thank you . they're gon na come get your photos now , okay ?","684":"next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09\/18\/1949 . patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction . bmp's been , uh , 3,000 in march , and is about six- was up to 6,000 in april . she was increasingly dyspneic . we changed her furosemide and torsemide 20 milligrams by mouth daily . uh to note , the patient is not currently on potassium supplement . her lisinopril had- has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in march . also did when i saw her last april . she reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at east metro . it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery . hey , miss miller , how are you today ?","685":"i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed .","686":"i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery .","687":"okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive .","688":"well that's great .","689":"you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ?","690":"well do n't , do n't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it .","691":"okay good .","692":"sure just , just keep it in moderation .","693":"and then are you still on an iron supplement ? and are you using the bathroom okay ?","694":"good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ?","695":"great .","696":"okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ?","697":"all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great .","698":"your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results .","699":"all in all i think you're doing good on paper though .","700":"um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march .","701":"so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today .","702":"i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good .","703":"all right let's take a quick listen . use my general physical exam template . and take a couple of deep breaths for me . your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things .","704":"so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine .","705":"great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand .","706":"perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june .","707":"you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today .","708":"lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ?","709":"okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like .","710":"um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery .","711":"so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield .","712":"i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon .","713":"so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go .","714":"you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ?","715":"doctor: all right , assessment and plan . chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate . uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer . uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .","716":"dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03\/04\/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ?","717":"it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller .","718":"so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ?","719":"okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ?","720":"mm-hmm .","721":"okay , that's good .","722":"okay , i see .","723":"mm-hmm , okay .","724":"okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though .","725":"probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ?","726":"okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ?","727":"and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ?","728":"okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ?","729":"okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ?","730":"okay . like , in terms of gripping things ?","731":"really ?","732":"gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ?","733":"okay . is it neuropathy ?","734":"gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look .","735":"all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?","736":"okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?","737":"okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .","738":"and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?","739":"okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .","740":"so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?","741":"okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .","742":"okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?","743":"okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?","744":"okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .","745":"okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?","746":"okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural .","747":"all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards .","748":"um , you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute , and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can .","749":"all right . well , it was nice meeting you , my friend .","750":"doctor: physical exam , elderly white gentleman presents in a wheelchair . no apparent distress . per the template , down through neuro- neurologic .

heavy alcohol or drug use ?","811":"and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ?","812":"and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ?","813":"okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice .","814":"issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs .","815":"lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted .","816":"yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly .","817":"increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon .","818":"the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged .","819":"correct .","820":"well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement .","821":"so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged .","822":"no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that .","823":"well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease .","824":"well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs .","825":"we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too .","826":"crestor , how long have you been taking that ?","827":"okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives .","828":"i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol .","829":"great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that .","830":"hopefully , within the next two weeks . you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up .","831":"when i get the results from the test , i will contact you . and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps .","832":"uh , let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver .","833":"definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation . and be mindful of eating foods that you were sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea .","834":"excellent . and do you have any other questions for me ?","835":"great . so remember when you check out the front desk , schedule follow-up appointment with me for four weeks and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn .","836":"and expect a call from radiology scheduling about setting up your ultrasound .","837":"doctor: thank you , mr. allen .","838":"next patient is sophia jackson , mrnr472348 . she's a 57 year old female who is here for a surgical consult . her dermatologist referred her . she biopsied a 0.7 millimeter lesion which was located on right inferior back . pathology came back as melanoma . mrs. jackson , it's good to meet you .","839":"yeah , i hear your dermatologist sent you to me 'cause she found a melanoma ?","840":"okay and when did you first notice the spot ?","841":"i see . and so you went to the dermatologist on april 10th to get it checked out , right ?","842":"well i'm really glad you took it seriously and got it checked . who in your family has had skin cancer , and do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell ?","843":"okay . do you have any other types of cancer in the family , like breast or ovarian ?","844":"okay , and was that your mom or dad's father ?","845":"okay . and , um , have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ?","846":"good- good . uh , let's go over your medical history from your chart . i have that you're not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you're allergic to augmentin , is that right ?","847":"okay , and for social history can you tell me what you do for work ?","848":"okay and have you ever been a smoker ?","849":"i'm glad you're trying to quit . uh , what about your surgical history , have you had any surgeries ?","850":"okay , great , we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been , any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ?","851":"good . well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind .","852":"okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ?","853":"all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation . there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam . okay , you can sit up . um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about . uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further .","854":"no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything .","855":"so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision .","856":"yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it , as it heals . um , but since we're , we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems . however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly so she can monitor you . uh , your dermatologist will check that this one does n't come back , but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious . uh , unfortunately , since you've had one melanoma , you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else .","857":"good , and i'm sure she's already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight .","858":"good . other than that , i think that's all for me . um , we'll get you set up for the ultrasound , the procedure . do you have any questions for me ?","859":"okay , my nurse will be in to get you scheduled , so sit tight . it was very good to meet you .","860":"doctor: please add the following pathology r- , to results . a pathology , shave of right inferior back , malignant melanoma , invasive , superficial spreading . histology , superficial spreading . clark level 4 , breslow thickness 0.7 millimeters , radial growth phase present , vertical growth phase not identified . mitotic features , less than one millimeter squared . ulceration not identified , progression not identified , lymphatic invasion not identified , perineural invasion not identified , microscopic satellitosis not identified . infiltrating , uh , lymphocytes , breast . um , melanocytic nevus not identified . predominant cytology epithelioid , peripheral margin positive , deep margin , uh , negative , stage 1 . also note that i reviewed the dermatologist's photo of the lesion which showed an asymmetric black and brown nevus with central a melanotic component and irregular border . for assessment and plan , the patient presents today with newly diagnosed melanoma . biopsy revealed an intermediate thickness melanoma . on examination today , there is right inguinal lymph node with slightly atypical consistency . i recommended an ultrasound to rule out metastatic disease . if the ultrasound is normal , the patient is a candidate for wide local excision with a one to two centimeter margin . primary closure should be possible , but skin graft closure may be needed . the relationship between tumor histology and prognosis and treatment was carefully reviewed . the need for follow-up , according to the national comprehensive cancer network guidelines , was reviewed . we also reviewed the principles of sun avoidance , skin self-examination , and the abcdes of mole surveillance . after discussing the procedure , risk and expected outcomes , and possible complications , questions were answered and the patient expressed understanding and did choose to proceed .","861":"donna torres , date of birth , 08\/01\/1980 . hi donna ! how are you ?","862":"i'm doing well , thank you . and so , i saw that dr. brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ?","863":"okay . how is it working for you ?","864":"mm . okay .","865":"well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too .","866":"and that was before we started the progesterone .","867":"so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also .","868":"hmm , okay .","869":"but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time .","870":"all right . so not really a link there , all right .","871":"yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too .","872":"and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also .","873":"yeah , i can absolutely see that .","874":"well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?","875":"have you lost weight ?","876":"all right .","877":"okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner .","878":"okay , good . um , anything else going on ?","879":"all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative\/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ?","880":"all right , well , let's just repeat it then .","881":"okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check .","882":"have you had the vaccine ?","883":"okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .","884":"all right . well , let's complete your exam .","885":"so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps .","886":"mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ?","887":"okay , right here ?","888":"yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away .","889":"all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ?","890":"okay , great . all right , looks good .","891":"you can go ahead and sit up .","892":"all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now .","893":"well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign .","894":"well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed .","895":"so those are all good things .","896":"because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change .","897":"yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them .","898":"um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .","899":"all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .","900":"all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ?","901":"all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else .","902":"doctor: all right .","903":"sophia brown . date of birth , 3\/17\/1946 . this is a new patient visit . she's here to establish care for a history of dcis . we'll go over the history with the patient . hello , ms. brown .","904":"wonderful . i'm doctor stewart . it's lovely to meet you .","905":"so , you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lumpectomy last year . is that right ?","906":"okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ?","907":"perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ?","908":"great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?","909":"i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .","910":"yep , definitely . based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .","911":"i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !","912":"and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .","913":"okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ?","914":"definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you .","915":"i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ?","916":"okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ?","917":"okay . do you have children ?","918":"ah , big family then . that's nice .","919":"i bet . sounds like fun .","920":"did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?","921":"okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?","922":"okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .","923":"okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?","924":"okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?","925":"okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er\/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?","926":"okay . and how about family history ?","927":"all right . any family history of breast cancer ?","928":"did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?","929":"wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?","930":"excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ?","931":"okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you . okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes . in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero . do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ?","932":"okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you .","933":"as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er\/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy . so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you .","934":"in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me .","935":"wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ?","936":"okay , great . my nurse will be in shortly to discharge you . take care !","937":"good morning ms. reyes !","938":"how are you

there's high blood pressure , diabetes , thyroid disease , heart disease , kidney disease and gastric ulcers . for your current medications , it does n't look like you're taking anything at this time . and you're allergic to percocet , vicodin and regulin . and it looks like you've had intentional weight loss ?","955":"that is awesome . and how did you do that ?","956":"that's great .","957":"and

there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro","1018":"acromioclavicular joints","1019":"yeah and looks like you have good hand grip let me see so on the neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is is intact to light touch","1020":"yep so you did get a we get we had to get a x-ray of your shoulder before you came in and so it's normal so that's really good so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you you do have that left shoulder pain so your symptoms are most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured tendon you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na order an mri of your left shoulder  and so we're gon na begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on have you done physical therapy before","1021":"okay so what i'm gon na do i'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder and that should definitely help with the pain during that time you can also continue to take tylenol i do n't think i need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you so if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which should provide some relief but i think right now we can just go with the the pt and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury so do you have any questions about the plan","1022":"yeah so many patients are very successful with rehab and so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time once we build up those muscles around that shoulder you know things things the pain alleviates itself and and and you will be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights all all the active things people do these days","1023":"well hello christina so how are you doing i was notified you were in the hospital for some heart failure what happened","1024":"i'm sure you do n't yeah i see that your blood pressure was high also it was two hundred over ninety have you been","1025":"yeah that's","1026":"yeah that's pretty high are you taking your medications or you missing some doses","1027":"yeah yeah you really need to take them very consistently now you also said you were watching your diet did you did you have some slips with that you said your ankles were swelling","1028":"are you eating a lot of salty foods and pizza or","1029":"well so do you do you go out to eat a lot or do you where you where where are you eating those potato chips or is that just the home snacking or","1030":"goodness well you know you we need to probably stop eating those now","1031":"well since you've been in the hospital and and they've helped you out with some with all that how are you feeling now","1032":"mm-hmm and they","1033":"and they gave you a water pill and is that is that helping is that making you pee a lot","1034":"goodness","1035":"and so they added another blood pressure medication also how are you doing with that are you feeling a little bit better","1036":"well a a pill box or maybe setting an alarm on your phone might really help","1037":"yeah okay well that's good to hear so now have you bought a blood pressure cuff to have at home now","1038":"okay and you might even just keep a log of what your blood pressures are and when it's up think about you know what you've eaten if you've done something different because that may help you to figure out what you need to cut back on or how you might need to change your your eating habits a little bit so","1039":"have you been short of breath or any problems sleeping since you've been home","1040":"okay good alright have you had any chest pain","1041":"okay alright well let's do a quick physical exam here so your vital signs your blood pressure looks pretty good today at one twenty eight over seventy two your temperature is ninety eight . seven and your heart rate is seventy two your respirations are eighteen your oxygen saturation looks pretty good at at ninety six percent okay now on your neck exam there is no jugular venous distention on your heart exam i appreciate a two over six systolic ejection murmur which i've heard before and so it's stable and your lungs are clear bilaterally and your lower extremities show just trace edema now now we since we did the echocardiogram i reviewed those results and it does show a preserved ef of fifty five percent abnormal diastolic filling and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem for your congestive heart failure it sounds like this was caused by dietary indiscretion and some uncontrolled hypertension so i want you to continue on your bumex two milligrams once daily continue to watch your diet and avoid salty foods might try keeping that log we talked about with your blood pressures and what you've eaten if if your blood pressure seems a little high also weigh yourself daily and call me if you gain three pounds in two days okay","1042":"and i also want you to see a nutritionist to give you some education about what foods you can eat okay now for your second problem for i know this sounds like this is just for you and so for your second problem for your hypertension i want you to continue on the cozaar one hundred milligrams daily continue on the norvasc five milligrams once daily also and i'm going to order a renal artery ultrasound just to be sure we're not missing anything and then like maybe you know some renal artery stenosis or something and so so for your third problem for your kidney disease i wan na get some more labs to make sure you tolerate this the new medications and then i'll see you again in three months do you have any questions","1043":"alright it's good to see you and i hope we'll just keep getting you feeling better","1044":"hey george how are you today i understand you're here for some numbness and tingling in your fingers and some pain in your wrist","1045":"okay and you said that's been ongoing for several months do you know what caused this type of pain or is it just something that started slowly or","1046":"what kind of work do you do","1047":"yard work","1048":"landscaping okay so a lot of raking a lot of digging so a lot of repetitive type movements","1049":"okay okay just a couple questions for you you did say that you have the pain at night in that and you have to you get that numbness into the hand is it in all the fingers","1050":"okay okay and anything into that little into your fifth finger your little finger any numbness there at times no","1051":"okay what about your right hand any problems with that hand","1052":"okay okay good and just a couple you know do you how do you have many or do you drink often do you have you know many any alcohol consumption","1053":"okay and do you have any evidence of any anybody ever said that you had some rheumatoid arthritis in your hand or wrist anything like that","1054":"okay okay good so let me go ahead and do a physical exam here real quick and you know i'm gon na quickly just listen to your heart and lungs okay that's good i'd like you to squeeze i'm gon na hold your hands here and i'd like you to squeeze both hands","1055":"you seem a little bit weaker on that left hand is that what you've noticed","1056":"okay do you you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or","1057":"okay okay good and so you you do have a a grip strength is less on the left and i just wan na touch your fingers here on the on the right side you can feel me touching all the fingers on the right","1058":"okay okay and i wan na turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over and i'm gon na go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back here does that do anything when i do that","1059":"okay and then when i do that on the left side","1060":"same thing okay so you do have a bilateral positive tinel's sign so so here's here's where i'm at i think your your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping the heavy labor and you you know your your clinical exam and and history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome i do want to order so where are we gon na go from here i would like to order a a study it's called an emg where it it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers we will follow up with that but as far as your treatment so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification now i know you are a landscaper is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time","1061":"okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you","1062":"okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do","1063":"okay yeah i'm looking for a landscape designer i need somebody to put in some elaborate walkways back through the backyard so yeah we can do stuff like that i mean if you have an idea what you want i think that's easy","1064":"okay yeah i may have to keep that in mind because i do wan na do some of that so let's listen i'm gon na get my my nurse in here to discharge you do you have any other questions for me before we end this","1065":"okay take care and i'll look forward to see you in two weeks","1066":"hey dylan what's going on","1067":"which elbow is it","1068":"okay and you said you lift a lot of weights","1069":"did you play any sports when you were younger","1070":"okay and did your elbows hurt at that time or is this a a new injury","1071":"when did it start","1072":"okay on both elbows about a year and a half ago","1073":"okay have you taken anything for the pain","1074":"okay and does anything make it better or worse","1075":"okay have you tried icing","1076":"does that give you any relief","1077":"alright is it the inside or outside of your elbows","1078":"inside okay let's just do a quick physical exam here i'll take a look at your right elbow first","1079":"if i bend it this way up does it hurt it's your left does that hurt","1080":"how about this","1081":"okay so pain with both flexion and extension","1082":"looks like you have little bit of limited range of motion on extension not on flexion though you said it hurts right here on the inside of your elbow","1083":"okay so pain on the medial side with palpation","1084":"alright how about the outside","1085":"no pain with palpation outside of the elbow you have do you have normal sensation in your fingers","1086":"okay great","1087":"sensation is normal to the touch","1088":"pulses equal in all extremities how about the left elbow same thing if i bend it this way does that hurt","1089":"how about this way","1090":"alright so little bit of pain on flexion and extension little bit of limited range of motion on extension of the arm how about if you twist like you're opening a door","1091":"okay so some pain with torsion and twisting supination what about pronation","1092":"no pain with pronation on the right side","1093":"same thing on the left","1094":"pain with supination no pain with pronation","1095":"alright so dylan it took some x-rays coming in looks like you do n't have any any fractures or any bony misalignment which i expect with this kind of injury i do think that what you have is medial epicondylitis which is","1096":"yes same thing have you been golfing a lot","1097":"okay also known as pictures elbow","1098":"hmmm well in any case what i'm gon na have to do is i'm gon na send you up for mri to take another look at this","1099":"that will be our next step so we'll get you scheduled for the mri probably get you in pretty quick here since we're a private practice","1100":"yeah and once you get the mri i'll know a little bit more what i'd like to do is something called a whole blood transfusion have you heard of that before","1101":"yeah it should help with the healing of your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow","1102":"mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow","1103":"what is it","1104":"mm-hmm","1105":"yeah that's exactly what it is","1106":"we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so hopefully i mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this","1107":"yeah and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks it's not not a major procedure and you should heal in the next two weeks so that wo n't be a problem especially considering that you're expecting a newborn soon we want to make sure you're all healed for that","1108":"i read it in your chart","1109":"yeah anything else going on today","1110":"very good thank you","1111":"nice to see you","1112":"hey bruce so see here my my notes here is you here he had positive lab work for hep c so how're you doing today","1113":"okay so in the past have any doctors ever told you that you had hep c","1114":"okay so just you know i need to ask do you have a history of iv drug use or you know have known any hep c partners","1115":"okay that that's good i mean i'm i'm happy that you were able to to kick that habit i know a lot of my patients that i see you know they're still dealing with with those dements so i'm i'm i'm happy that you're able to do that so hopefully we can get you better okay","1116":"so what about alcohol use is that something that you used to do a lot","1117":"okay and have you ever smoked before","1118":"yeah yeah and that that's something i've got to work on too because hep c along with smoking you know both of those are n't are n't good so hopefully we can help you out you know if your pcp has n't prescribe something for you already and possibly we can we can do that for you as well","1119":"so do you have any other medical conditions","1120":"okay and what conditions would you say run in your family","1121":"okay alright so let me go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good and on general appearance you appear to be in no distress no jaundice on the skin on your heart exam you have a nice regular rhythm rate regular rate and rhythm with a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur is appreciated on your lung exam your lungs are clear without wheezes rales or rhonchi on your abdominal exam bowel sounds are present your abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly yes let me i will change that one splenomegaly and on your muscle exam there is no gait disturbance or edema so i did we i was able to review your your results of your recent lab work and your hcv antibody test was positive so your your liver panel we did one of those and it showed an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so that's pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you do have hepatitis c so your initial labs were consistent with that hep c diagnosis and so you know i do n't know if you read much about hep c but hepatitis c is a viral infection that does affect your liver and you've most likely had it for several years now it it it most patients do n't see symptoms until years later so the next step that i would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work so that includes checking your hep c rna and your hcv genotype and i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and we will do that by ordering an ultrasound elasto elastography with this information we will we we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment right so how does that sound","1122":"okay yeah so we can start with the same screening that you had for august first so we'll just let's do that hep c antibody test and i'll actually help you set up those appointments with your your family doctor and then we can just see you back in three weeks and based on the results you know we will take action as needed okay","1123":"alright","1124":"my nurse will be in with those those orders","1125":"alright thanks","1126":"hi virginia how are you today what brings you in","1127":"okay yeah so okay let's before i dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling","1128":"okay you measure it at home you you you measure your blood pressure at home","1129":"yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home","1130":"okay okay yeah that's good that's good and have you ever tried do you go to cvs at all","1131":"okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so","1132":"you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally","1133":"well yeah that would be better","1134":"okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches","1135":"okay what about chest pain","1136":"shortness of breath","1137":"even with exertion","1138":"okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed","1139":"okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure","1140":"okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on","1141":"okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve","1142":"okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for","1143":"okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me","1144":"yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan","1145":"okay take care i'll talk to you later","1146":"carolyn is a 34 -year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type two who is here today with a headache so hi there carolyn it's nice to see you again listen i'm sorry you're having headaches well let's talk about it but i would like to record this conversation with this app that's gon na help me focus on you more would that be okay with you","1147":"okay great thanks so carolyn tell me about your headache and headache or headaches when did when did they start and and what symptoms are you having","1148":"okay and alright and so this started about a week ago has it been fairly constant since it started or does it come and go does it come and go or what","1149":"hmmm okay and do you notice any any timing difference you know is it is it worse in the morning worse in the evening is there anything else that makes it better or worse","1150":"okay and do you feel any sort of tightness in the back of your neck or in your shoulders or you know you said it's in the back of your head primarily any discomfort anywhere else","1151":"okay and did the headache start all of a sudden carolyn or has it been gradual or what","1152":"okay okay and alright and have you noticed any fever along with the headache","1153":"okay and any visual changes you know wavy lines in your vision spots in your vision or anything like that","1154":"okay and have you had headaches like this before","1155":"okay so this is n't the worst headache you've ever had what did you say","1156":"okay alright and so okay fair enough now how's your diabetes been been been doing lately have you what have your blood sugars been running in the low one hundreds or two hundreds or what","1157":"really okay well we will get you back on that and and we can talk about that but how about your metformin are you still taking the five hundred milligrams once a day no actually it looks like we increased your metformin to five hundred milligrams twice a day last visit are you still taking that","1158":"okay great and okay you're still watching your diet and getting some exercise","1159":"okay the headache has has maybe made you feel uncomfortable and prevented your your exercise would you say or what","1160":"okay okay so you probably have n't been out golfing i remember you're a big golfer so not not lately uh so you know being","1161":"being down being down here in florida we got ta get get some golf in so hey did you see the masters by the way a few weeks ago was n't that i do n't know did you happen to catch it","1162":"yeah that was crazy what a what a finish what an amazing what an amazing tournament right what do you think yeah yeah that's great well we'll we'll get you feeling better and get you back out there and now are you still working a lot on the computer ac or","1163":"carolyn okay yeah you're still working a lot on the computer for work okay are you taking breaks every hour or so you know get up stand around walk stand walk around that can be helpful","1164":"hmmm okay understood alright well listen let's go ahead and examine you okay so so on your physical exam your physical exam is pretty normal unremarkable for the most part and you know few things a few exceptions so first of all on your heent exam your eye exam your extraocular motions are intact without pain you have a funduscopic exam that shows no papilledema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back of your eye and on your neck exam you do have some posterior mild posterior paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well and otherwise on your exam let's see your heart exam on your heart exam you have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam so it just means i hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and i'm not too worried about that we'll watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable and so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan so carolyn for your first problem of the headache i do think that you have a tension type headache and i think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders and you know working at the computer i think is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that tylenol for the pain i'm also gon na give you a mild muscle relaxant i'll write you for flexeril five milligrams three times a day and you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms i want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worsen or you develop a fever but i do n't think that this is a a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that i think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus let's continue you on the metformin five hundred milligrams i am going to order a hemoglobin a1c and also a cbc and a chem-12 to check some of your blood tests blood chemistries and so forth and we will continue you on the metformin i do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful so when you come back in a month i want you to bring those numbers with you we can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine that's really gon na help you keep those blood sugars under control as well okay so how does that sound for a plan any other questions for me","1165":"yeah that that just right but also let's set up an appointment in four weeks and i wan na see you back in four weeks if it's not if the headache is not better within the next few days with this flexeril then you can give us a call and and get back in later this week or early next but definitely if things get worse give us a call sooner and you know i meant to ask you on i wanted to ask if you had a history of any any trauma meaning have you hit your head or you have n't fallen hit your head or anything like that have you","1166":"okay alright understood okay great well then i'll see you back in a month if not before okay you take care of yourself nice seeing

gon na be calling out some of my findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking here first at your vital signs your vital signs look pretty good you do have a low-grade fever of about a hundred . four right now but otherwise your blood pressure is pretty good it's about one thirty two over eighty and your heart rate is eighty four now that looks pretty good so i'm just gon na go ahead and examine you so on your facial exam i'm gon na just press on your face here does this hurt","1186":"okay on facial examination the patient has no pain to palpation of the frontal or maxillary sinuses on nasal examination there is edema and erythema of the nasal turbinates bilaterally with associated clear discharge open up your mouth and say","1187":"on throat examination there is bilateral erythema and edema of the peritonsillar space with exudates present bilaterally the uvula is midline on your neck exam i do appreciate some cervical lymphadenopathy on the right hand side on your lung exam your lungs you have some coarse rhonchi at the bases that clear with cough and on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur or or rub so what does all of that mean teresa so all of that means is that yes you're showing signs of what we call an upper respiratory infection and i'm concerned that you might have some strep in the back of your throat based on the findings so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you okay so for your first problem of your sore throat i'm gon na go ahead and have the medical assistant come in and swab you for a rapid strep test and if that's positive i wan na go ahead and place you on or prescribe amoxicillin five hundred milligrams three times a day for ten days and i'm gon na give you some lidocaine swish and swallow so that will help with some of the pain and you can take some ibuprofen as needed which will also help with the pain and some of that fever okay i do want you to go ahead and continue to to hydrate as much as possible what kind of questions do you have about that","1188":"sure now for your next problem of your hypertension i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel on you and i think i do wan na increase i do wan na increase the lisinopril to forty milligrams once a day just to get your blood pressure under better control and we'll see how you do on the forty milligrams once a day for your third problem of your diabetes let's go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and just to make sure that we do n't have to make any adjustments to your metformin how does that sound","1189":"any questions","1190":"doctor: okay bye good to see you i'll be in touch","1191":"good morning carolyn how are you","1192":"so i see here that you hurt your right ankle can you tell me what happened","1193":"okay and you said this happened yesterday correct","1194":"okay and have you been able to walk on it at all","1195":"okay and then what have you been doing for your foot or ankle pain since that happened","1196":"okay and can you rate your pain for me","1197":"okay and does the ibuprofen help with that pain","1198":"okay and when you take your ibuprofen what can you what's your pain level then","1199":"yes ma'am","1200":"it's with ibuprofen okay what's your pain level without then","1201":"okay alright that that sounds good have you ever injured that foot and ankle before","1202":"okay you know and i see here that you have a history of playing sports looks like you played soccer in college and then played a little bit of a inner marrow soccer now","1203":"i'm i'm guessing you probably have n't been able to do that since you hurt your ankle","1204":"so did you hear about the new major league soccer stadium and team that's coming to town they opened in the this year actually they built the stadium have you been down there yet","1205":"yeah we are all excited it's going to be a good time well have you experienced any numbness or tingling in that right foot","1206":"okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam your vitals look good and everything there looks okay now i'm gon na do a focused exam on your right ankle i do appreciate some ecchymosis or bruising over the lateral malleolus malleolus associated with some edema or swelling of that area you are positive for tenderness to palpation of the anterior lateral soft tissue and now i do n't appreciate any laxity on anterior drawer and inversion stress there is no bony tenderness on palpation to that foot or ankle area now on neurovascular exam of your right foot you have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch and all of that is consistent with what's present on your left side as well so i did review the results of your of your x-ray the x-ray of your right ankle showed no fracture which is a good thing so now let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for the first problem of right ankle pain your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain or i'm sorry right ankle sprain of your lateral ligament complex more specifically your anterior talofibular ligament now this ligament's on the outside of your ankle ankle which got stretched when you fell the best treatment at this time for your sprain is to keep your leg elevated when you're seated and let's continue to ice okay you're gon na be given an air cast which is gon na help stabilize that ankle and i'm also going to prescribe some crutches because i want you to stay off that leg and start walking on it stay off your leg for now and then in a couple of days start walking on it as tolerated do you have any questions or concerns for me","1207":"so your symptoms should significantly improve over a few weeks but i'd like to follow up with you and see how you're doing let's say i'll see you again in fourteen days now i do want you to go ahead and continue to take nsaids or ibuprofen as needed to help with any pain and that's also gon na help reduce that inflammation and swelling okay","1208":"alright i will see you again in two weeks carolyn","1209":"doctor: you're welcome","1210":"how are you doing","1211":"well i'm glad that you're taking the first steps to quit smoking would you tell me a little bit more about your history of smoking","1212":"okay do you use any other type of tobacco products","1213":"okay and i understand that so when you wake up in the morning how soon after waking up do you smoke your first cigarette","1214":"okay so i'm really excited that you wan na quit and i know that you probably heard this multiple times before but this really is one of the best things that you can do to help your health especially since you have the history of gout and type two diabetes this is really gon na be a great step in you having better long term health outcomes","1215":"hey that's great and that's great to hear congratulations i'm so excited to hear about the new baby","1216":"i i have a daughter myself have have you picked out any names","1217":"okay alright that sounds good well congratulations again i'm very excited for you and your and and your wife that that's this is great","1218":"so you mentioned you tried to quit before can you tell me a little bit about the methods that you used or or what you tried","1219":"well you are absolutely correct you know stress can often be a trigger for things like smoking and drinking have you thought what you would do this time when you encountered the stressful situations","1220":"okay well that's great to hear that you're getting back in the gym that will be good for your long term health too you know helping to maintain that type two diabetes you know those are really great strategies talking about gym for stress relief and and you know we have other products as well that you can use for an additional aid to help you stop smoking have you given any thought to using some type of smoking cessation aid at this time or or what do you think about that","1221":"okay alright that that sounds good it's good that you've you've picked out one of those aids and have you thought of a quit date i mean we we really wan na talk about when you're gon na say this is the day","1222":"that's a fantastic day and happy birthday coming up on monday","1223":"so let's talk a little bit about your exam here okay i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam and i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good including your oxygen saturation blood pressure for today was one twenty eight over eighty eight heart rate was sixty eight respirations were sixteen and your pulse ox was ninety eight percent on room air so those were all really good now on your heart exam you do have a nice regular and your your rate is of regular rate and rhythm or i'm sorry your heart exam for your heart exam notice that your heart is regular in rate and rhythm i do however still appreciate that two over six systolic murmur that we talked about in the past now that's okay we'll just continue to monitor that now for your lung exam i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your lungs your lungs are clear and equal bilateral with no expiratory wheezes and no rales or rhonchi are appreciated on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy when i listen i do n't hear any extra noises so i do n't hear any hearing any carotid bruit which is a good thing now for my impression and plan let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem of nicotine dependence first of all i just want to apply you on making this first step to stop smoking and i want you to know with absolute one hundred percent certainty that i'm gon na be with you every step of the way i think it's fantastic that you're very welcome i i i think it's fantastic you've chosen next monday as a quit date and on that day i'm gon na start you with a twenty one milligram nicotine patch and the goal will be to decrease that over time okay now we will work together to decrease that so there is no necessarily hard dates in mind okay be sure to change the patch location each day and that's going to help reduce or avoid that skin irritation that can occur if you use the same location over and over again i would like to see you again in two weeks just to see how things are going and we will reevaluate at that time the dosage for your nicotine patch now we also see further need to discuss any handouts you received today for those common smoking triggers i really want you to keep an eye on and monitor your stress level not only about work but also the fact that you are experiencing are going to be be a new father and we really want to watch any stress you will be experiencing around the birth of your new child so please keep an eye on that and let me know how that goes now for now until we meet in two weeks go ahead and keep up your exercise routine i think that's a great plan and just try to monitor your stress and and maybe think about some things like meditation or adding in some yoga and that type of thing to help further work with your your stress levels so do you have any questions for me","1224":"okay so for your other conditions that we talked about briefly your second condition of type two diabetes we'll let's go ahead and continue to maintain that with diet and exercise and we'll just monitor your type two diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c for your next blood draw since i'll see you in two weeks go ahead and have that done and we will talk about that when you come back in now for your third problem of your history of gout let's go ahead and continue you on your allopurinol and just you know continue to watch those foods that will exacerbate your uric acid levels any other questions about those","1225":"alright sounds good i'll see you in two weeks congratulations on the baby and and we're excited about next monday that's your quit date","1226":"you're welcome i'll see you in two weeks thanks bye-bye","1227":"good morning julie how are you doing this morning","1228":"okay and do you remember what caused the pain initially","1229":"okay now it it says here that it's in both knees is that correct","1230":"okay it kinda try let's let's try describing the pain for me please","1231":"a deep achy pain okay what kind of activities makes the pain feel worse","1232":"okay so you work from home","1233":"okay okay so there is a lot of desk setting at home is your office upstairs or is it i mean do you have to go up or downstairs to get to it","1234":"okay okay how do you like working from home","1235":"and the parking i'm sure the parking is","1236":"yeah i you know if i could do telehealth visits all day long i would be totally happy with that yeah and just set it home and do those so you mentioned is there anything that makes that pain feel better","1237":"okay now you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past what have what are they and did they work at all","1238":"okay but you're never really pain free is that what i hear you saying","1239":"okay so are you active other than going up and down the steps to your office","1240":"yeah you know what that's that's i am a biker and i know that once you get that into your you know you have loved doing that activity it's so frustrating when you ca n't it's almost like a it's almost like a dry it almost becomes a drug when you get up","1241":"okay so have you noticed any redness or swelling in your knees","1242":"okay and have you ever injured your knees before","1243":"okay great so let's go ahead and do a i just wan na take a look here i reviewed your vitals and overall they look good your blood pressure is one twenty over seventy your your heart rate is sixty and your respiratory rate is fourteen those are all phenomenal numbers as i listened to your heart it is at a regular and a slower rate but i do n't hear any extra sounds so there is no murmurs as we go through that now on musculoskeletal exam you have a normal gait i watched you you know kinda walk in here this morning your strength i just wan na check it when i go ahead and i want you to move your leg okay your muscle strength is is good you do have a three out of five for abduction of your legs bilaterally and that's you know kinda bringing your legs in the remainder of your muscle strength for your lower extremities is a five out of five now let me focus specifically on your knee examination i do n't see any redness or ecchymosis or warmth of the skin and those are big words you know i do n't see any bruising or or that redness there is no effusion that's just like a fluid underneath the knee i do n't appreciate that any at all you do seem to have some tenderness when i palpate and you do have a positive patellar grind test when you stood up i could feel that as we went through there you did say you had that knee pain with squatting but your lachman your anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray test are all negative bilaterally neurologically and your your your lower extremities your patella and your achilles reflex are symmetrical and that's good so i did review the x-rays of both your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so based on what you told me and reviewing the mri that you had done before you came in your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a really common condition that we see that causes knee knee pain especially in really active young people that's probably why i do n't get it when i'm riding my bike forever and ever now this condition has to do with the way your kneecap moves across along the groove of your thigh bone your femur so for pain i want you to continue to take the ibuprofen or any other anti-inflammatories you know aleve or any of those as you need it to help with the pain now i am going to recommend physical therapy well they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises this is probably one of the best things that you can do and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you might have do you have any questions for me","1244":"absolutely my goal is to get you out there and maybe we can cross pads on the the bike trail some day you are gon na have to take it a little bit easy for now but we are gon na get you back and once we do that i think you will be really pleased is there anything else","1245":"okay have a great day","1246":"thank you","1247":"hi abigail how are you today","1248":"good i'm doctor sanchez and i'm gon na go ahead and take a look i saw with your notes that you've been having some knee pain yes that's that's true you know it's been going on for a while i like to run i do jogs i sign up for the 5k tack you know sometimes the marathon and i have n't been doing longer distances because","1249":"okay okay what have you done for it so far what makes it better what makes it worse","1250":"okay okay and did you see anybody for this before coming into the office here","1251":"okay okay good so ice and rest makes it feel better running and and activity makes it hurt a little bit more is that correct","1252":"okay do you have any family history of arthritis or any of those type of immune diseases","1253":"okay and do you get is it is this primarily worse in the morning or does it is it just there all the time when it comes on","1254":"okay so let's go ahead and i want to do a quick examination here your blood pressure and was one twenty over sixty that's phenomenal your heart rate was fifty eight and you can tell that you're a runner with that that level of a heart rate and your respirations were fourteen so all of that looked very good there was no fever when you came in when i'm gon na just quickly listen to your heart and lungs okay those those sound good but let me get let's focus here on your lower extremities i'm i'm gon na look at your your left knee first when i move your left knee do you get any type of pain or is it just feel like normal and it's always your pain's always isolated to the right","1255":"okay okay so let me i just want you to back up here in the stretcher a little bit more and i'm just gon na do some movement of your knee any okay so i want you to push your leg out against my hand does that hurt","1256":"okay and if you pull back does that hurt a little bit","1257":"okay and i'm gon na move it around so when i look at the knee there is no redness there's no swelling i can appreciate a a small amount of effusion and that means that there's a little bit of fluid under the knee or in that knee's joint space and there is there is several reasons that could be now when i push on your knee does it hurt more on the inside or does it hurt more on the outside here","1258":"okay okay and you've got a good pedal pulse so you know you can feel that and when i touch your feet you do n't have any numbness or tingling or anything like that","1259":"okay well so what i want to tell you is that i think you have a knee sprain from overuse and we see that sometimes in runners now unfortunately you're gon na have to take some a little bit of time off of of active running but i do n't think it will be that long until we can get you up and running again now i reviewed the x-rays that we did when you first came into the office here this morning and the joint spaces of that right knee are are well maintained i do n't see any evidence of any fracture and when compared to the left knee everything looks good so i do n't even see any signs of any arthritis that i would've been suspecting i would like you to stay on two tylenol five hundred milligrams and two ibuprofen two hundred milligram tablets and i want you to take that three times a day and that's gon na help with both the pain and the inflammation i'm also gon na order some physical therapy for your your right knee and that physical therapy will help strengthen the lower extremities and make it give you a little bit of a balance and some they'll be able to recommend good running exercises for you i do wan na follow up with you in two weeks and see if we're getting better so let's no running for two weeks and if we're we're improving then we'll move on and probably start adding some additional activity does that sound like a plan","1260":"yeah absolutely and and those are good exercises but i'd like you to get that first physical therapy appointment in and they'll be able to talk with you on what the best exercises are for you to do","1261":"any questions","1262":"okay thank you abigail and i'd like i said stop out at the desk and we'll make an appointment for two weeks","1263":"doctor: thank you","1264":"okay so we are recording okay so okay so i understand you've so you've got a past medical history of type two diabetes and you're coming in and for evaluation of a newly diagnosed ovarian cancer so how are you doing today","1265":"right i want you you can talk about those things yes","1266":"okay so with your newly diagnosed ovarian cancer so how are you feeling today how are you doing","1267":"little depressed i can understand it's a lot to take on is n't it","1268":"okay okay so lem me ask you some questions so what kind of symptoms were you having that prompted you your doctor to do the tests","1269":"okay now do you have other symptoms such as weight loss constipation vomiting or issues with urination","1270":"okay yeah that's understandable so do you have any children or have you ever been pregnant","1271":"do you have any children or have you ever been pregnant","1272":"okay so and do you know at what age you got your period and when you started menopause","1273":"okay do you take any oral hormone replacement therapy","1274":"okay any history of endometriosis","1275":"endometriosis","1276":"okay how about any family history of any gynecological cancers","1277":"okay okay so i'm just gon na do a quick exam of your abdomen and then perform a vaginal exam okay","1278":"alright okay so i do feel the mass on the where to go here okay","1279":"i did okay okay so i do feel the mass on the left side but everything else looks good and on abdominal exam there is slight tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant no rebounding or guarding on vaginal exam there are no external lesions on the labia the vaginal vault is within normal limits the cervix is pink without lesions and on bimanual exam i appreciate a left adnexal mass and there is no masses on the right okay so now i reviewed the results of your abdominal ct which show a three centimeter left ovarian mass with an associated local localized lymph node involvement there is no evidence of gross peritoneal or metastatic disease so lem me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for the first problem so i do think this is most likely ovarian cancer looking at your ct scan it looks like stage three a disease based on the lymph node involvement i want to start by sending off some blood tests like a ca-125 and hcg and afp and ldh these are just tests that help me to determine what type of tumor i'm dealing with and then i want you to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if you have a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer so this stage of ovarian cancer is treated by performing surgery followed by adjunct chemotherapy so this means we'll start chemotherapy after you've recovered from surgery okay so for the surgery i would perform a hysterectomy remove both ovaries and perform a lymph node dissection to remove the involved and involve lymph nodes as well as any other ones i see and i'll also send a sample of any tissue if there anything that looks suspicious at all and we'll be able to tell exactly what stage this is based on the pathology reports i then recommend chemotherapy with cisplatin and taxol and based on how the surgery goes i may want you to receive intraperitoneal intraperitoneal chemo which is done inserting a small tube into your belly for the chemo to go directly into your peritoneum now i know that was a lot sick in do you have any questions or","1280":"well that's a good question so based on what i see at this time i will we believe you have a favorable diagnosis prognosis and you're also still young and healthy which makes your prognosis even better and we do need to see a final pathology report to give you a definitive answer though okay","1281":"hi billy how are you what's been going on the medical assistant told me that you're having some difficulty urinating","1282":"okay so let's talk a little bit about that now is your is your stream is your urination stream weak","1283":"okay and do you feel like you're emptying your bladder fully or do you feel like you still have some urine left in there when you when you finish","1284":"okay and are you waking up at night to go to the bathroom does it impact your sleep","1285":"okay so you're getting up about three or four times a night and and how long has this been going on you said for about six months","1286":"okay so you think it's been going on longer okay alright now how about have you had any burning when you urinate at all","1287":"no burning when you urinate okay and and any other any other issues any problems with your bowels any constipation issues","1288":"okay and ever have you ever had any issues where you had what we call urinary retention where you could n't pee and you needed to have like a catheter inserted","1289":"alright and have you ever seen a urologist i do n't think so you've been my patient for a while i do n't remember ever sending you but have you ever seen one","1290":"okay now tell me how are you doing with your with your heart when was the last time you saw doctor moore the cardiologist i know that you had the the stent placed in your right coronary artery about what was that twenty eighteen","1291":"he said everything was okay alright and so you have n't had any chest pain or shortness of breath you're still walking around doing your activities of daily living are you exercising","1292":"kind of okay now from what i remember i remember you being a big college football fan are you as excited as i am that georgia beat alabama in the national championships","1293":"you do n't really seem that excited","1294":"yeah i i really do n't like nick saving i'm so i'm super happy that that the dogs pulled it out","1295":"are you in alabama fan","1296":"okay alright well i mean i i'm i'm a long horns fan but anyway well i digress let's talk a little bit about your diabetes how are how are you doing with your sugars are you watching your diet","1297":"okay and are you still taking the metformin","1298":"you are okay alright now i wan na go ahead and just move on to a quick physical exam okay i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay alright i do have to do a rectal exam i apologize i'm just gon na be calling it out what what i what i appreciate okay so on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur hurt at the left base on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your abdominal exam your abdomen is nontender and nondistended i do n't appreciate any masses or any rebound or guarding on your prostate exam i do appreciate an enlarged prostate i do n't appreciate any masses on physical exam so what what does that mean billy so that ultimately means that you know everything looks good you know you have that little heart murmur which i believe you you've had in the past but we're gon na go ahead and look into that you know your prostate seems a little bit enlarged to me on physical exam so let's talk about how we can go about and and remedy that okay so for your first problem of this you know difficulty urinating i wan na go ahead and just order some routine labs i wan na get a a psa that kind of that ultimately kinda looks for prostate cancer issues which i do n't think you have because we did n't really appreciate that on physical exam i wan na go ahead and we can try to start you on what we call flomax zero point four milligrams once a day you should take it at night because it can cause people to get a little bit dizzy if they take it in the morning so i would take it at night and i wan na go ahead and refer you to a urologist just to look into this more so we can go ahead and and get this problem solved for you okay i'm also gon na go ahead and just order some routine blood tests just to make sure that we are not missing anything do you have any questions about that and i wan na go ahead and order a urinalysis and a urine culture","1299":"well i think the data it's it's i'm not really sure if it works or not i'm not that familiar with it let's just go ahead and stick with flomax and that's why we are gon na refer you to the urologist so that they can go ahead and talk to you about you know the most current treatment options for you okay","1300":"alright for your second problem of your coronary artery disease i wan na go ahead and order an echocardiogram just to follow up on that heart murmur that you had and i wan na go ahead and continue you on the lipitor forty milligrams a day and the aspirin and the metoprolol and i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel any questions about that","1301":"okay and then for your third problem of your diabetes it sounds like you're doing really well let's go ahead and continue you on the metformin a thousand milligrams twice a day we will go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c to see if we need to make any adjustments to that and i'm gon na see you again in about three to four weeks okay i want you to call me or message me in the patient portal if you have any concerns","1302":"i'm gon na reach out i'm gon na reach out to them now and see if they can get you in this week","1303":"doctor: okay alright well great it was good to see you bye i could just hit it and i can just talk and then i'm just","1304":"alright brittany so i see that you are experiencing some right foot pain could you tell me what happened","1305":"mm-hmm","1306":"alright","1307":"mm-hmm okay have you ever injured that foot before","1308":"okay so right now you're experiencing right leg pain but you have injured your your left leg before is that what i'm hearing","1309":"alright were you able to continue playing","1310":"i'm sorry okay so what have you been doing for the pain since then","1311":"okay could you one more time when did this injury happen","1312":"okay so did you say whether does the ibuprofen help at all","1313":"okay and then have you experienced any numb numbness or tingling","1314":"okay alright any loss in sensation","1315":"okay alright that's good to hear so you were playing tennis is that what you normally do to work out","1316":"i love it absolutely yeah my dad one time took me to play racquet ball and i learned the very bruisy way that that was n't for me yeah","1317":"it's it they they move pretty fast i'm not gon na lie alright so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my my physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings but if you have any questions go ahead stop me let me know but i will be explaining along the way okay","1318":"alright so i've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great you know your blood pressure i see is one twenty five over seventy that's almost textbook respiratory rate we are seeing you at a smooth eighteen excuse me your temperature you're running normal ninety seven . one you're you're satting at a hundred percent so and then your pulse so that's interesting like you're you're going at like about sixty beats a minute so i think they're i think we're doing pretty well i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop we have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam i do appreciate a little bit of stridor that's really interesting but i do n't hear any wheezes or rales so that's great for your i know this sounds weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt","1319":"okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions","1320":"so i'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot if you do n't it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flat-footed you can also develop arthritis in that foot so yes i i i highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with","1321":"so it's actually","1322":"no no no no no it's actually a day surgery and you'll be able to go home the same day and then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week you'll be in a cast and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do so the procedure itself is not very long you will and so like since you will be able to go home that's great but you wo n't be able to drive especially since you're saying are you left handed or right handed","1323":"yeah so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with so no you're gon na you're gon na need somebody to take you home but what","1324":"mm-hmm","1325":"yeah so unfortunately yes it does mean that you're out for the rest of the season but hopefully we can get you a great get you to a set up well for next season and in the meantime i think i'm gon na recommend after surgery that we get you to physical therapy i think that that's gon na be a really great way to like kinda strengthen the muscles and make sure that you're at peak performance before we put you back out there","1326":"alright","1327":"no problem so i do wan na let you know that there are some risks associated with any kind of surgical procedure i'm gon na bring you some paperwork and that my ma is gon na go over with you such as like risks of bleeding loss of sensation nerve damage all those things will be discussed with you and if you have any questions leading up to and even after your procedure go ahead and ask them and we'll be more than happy to help with that okay","1328":"alright","1329":"thank you","1330":"hey linda good to see you today so looking here in my notes looks like you you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on","1331":"okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go","1332":"alright are you able to urinate","1333":"okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes","1334":"third time alright","1335":"okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever","1336":"okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain","1337":"okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved","1338":"right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day","1339":"so we are getting close there","1340":"yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff","1341":"so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running","1342":"okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the the one eighties which was really high","1343":"so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that","1344":"we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help","1345":"okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright. so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday","1346":"okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday","1347":"that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain","1348":"no chest pain are you having any belly pain","1349":"no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt","1350":"okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful","1351":"alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound","1352":"doctor: okay no problem","1353":"hey mason good to see you today so let's see you here in my notes for evaluation of kidney stones your your pcp said you had some kidney stones so you got a referral over so can you tell me a little bit about that you know what happened when did you first notice them","1354":"okay so you said you had the pain on the right hand side does it move anywhere or radiate","1355":"okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go","1356":"mm-hmm","1357":"okay have you noticed any blood in your urine i know you've been draining probably take a good look at it has it been darker than usual","1358":"okay so have you had kidney stones before and then you said your father had them but","1359":"okay alright so let me do a quick exam of you your vital signs look good i do n't see any fever or your blood pressure and heart rate are fine so let me do a quick physical exam let me press here on your belly so on your examination of your abdomen there is no tenderness to to pain to palpation of the abdomen there is no rebound or guarding there is cva there is tenderness on the right side so that means","1360":"can you repeat that","1361":"no no no no no so that means like everything is normal right but i feel like you you you have some tenderness and inflammation over your kidney so that has to be expected because you do have a kidney stone so i did review the results of your ct and it does show a stone that's measuring point five centimeters located in the proximal right ureter and that's that duct that classes from your your kidney to down to your bladder there is no evidence of hydronephrosis that would mean that the stone is obstruct obstructing the ureter causing swelling in the kidney so there is there is no evidence of that so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone so right now i'm gon na recommend that we we have you push fluids just to help facilitate you urinating and passing the stone i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours for pain and you can continue to take tylenol between that for any breakthrough pain and you already have a strainer so that's good continue to use that and we can see continue that until the stone hasses and i'm also gon na order a bmp and your urinalysis and urine culture just to make sure that everything else is okay with you and based on urinalysis we can see if we need to prescribe you antibiotics see if you have any type of infection i do want to see you back in about one to two weeks and hopefully by that time you you passed the stone but if not we can discuss further treatment lithotripsy it's like a shock wave kinda breaks up that stone it's not it's not that invasive procedure but we can just we can discuss that if it has n't passed in that one to two weeks that sound good","1362":"alright","1363":"so i will see you in a week or so and hopefully you've passed that stone and i'll send my nurse in with that prescription","1364":"doctor: thanks","1365":"hi jeremy how are you","1366":"i'm okay the the medical assistant told me that you had this ulcer on your foot that's been there for a couple of weeks","1367":"going away","1368":"okay and how long did you say it's going on for","1369":"six eight weeks maybe","1370":"your sugars are running higher than normal okay do you recall what your last hemoglobin a1c was was it above nine","1371":"okay alright now what do you think caused this ulcer were you wearing some tight fitting shoes or did you have some trauma to your foot or","1372":"okay alright and have you had any fever or chills","1373":"okay and do you have do you have neuropathy where you get like numbing and tingling in your feet","1374":"mm-hmm kinda feels like it takes a little longer to","1375":"okay alright and then are you are you a smoker or did you smoke","1376":"okay alright when did you stop smoking","1377":"okay alright and how many packs a day would you smoke","1378":"okay alright how many years did you smoke for like twenty","1379":"okay alright now any other symptoms do you have any problems when you walk down the street do you get any pain in your calves at all when you walk","1380":"okay and you said you're active you're out in the yard and things like that do you go on long walks at all or no","1381":"mm-hmm","1382":"okay alright so we talked a little bit about your diabetes let's talk about your heart disease now your heart disease you had a heart attack in twenty eighteen we put a stent into your right coronary artery you're still taking your medications for that you're still on your aspirin","1383":"okay alright and any chest pain or shortness of breath or anything like that no no yeah no nothing more than yeah i would n't attribute anything","1384":"no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here","1385":"there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help","1386":"yeah i mean is this do we have to do any more tests or anything what are you we're gon na do an arterial ultrasound i'm going to go ahead and order an arterial ultrasound of your lower extremities to see what the blood supply is like and then i'm gon na go ahead and order a podiatry consult because i want them to see this wound and improve the wound care that you're doing and then for your next problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and talk to your primary care physician we need to get your diabetes better controlled because that impacts your wound healing as well okay","1387":"sure understood alright and for your last issue your coronary artery disease continue with your statin and i will talk to your cardiologist in case you need a procedure to see if you're cleared from a medical standpoint okay","1388":"alright","1389":"doctor: okay bye","1390":"so anna good to see you today so reading here in your appointment notes you were you were diagnosed with kidney stones from your your pcp and you currently have one and so they they had you come in so can you tell me what happened how's all that going for you","1391":"okay so on the right side so does that pain does it move anywhere or is it just kinda stay in that that one area","1392":"side okay so how would you describe the pain is it constant or is does it come and go","1393":"okay did you notice any pain when you're urinating i know i know you say you you saw you see blood but any pain with that","1394":"okay so have you taken anything i know have you tried like azo or any of that to","1395":"alright have you noticed any nausea vomiting fever chills","1396":"little nauseated yeah that's we expected so have you do you have a family history of kidney stones i know some people when they have them like their parents have them stuff but","1397":"alright and have you had any in the past or is this your first one","1398":"okay alright so we'll do we'll do an exam on you just to check you out so i guess you were in pain and stuff over the over the easter easter break there that","1399":"okay so i'm guessing you did n't get to go find the eggs on the easter egg hunt because of the you were in pain","1400":"okay well i i'm lucky enough my friends had an adult easter hag hunt for me and so i was able to find a couple eggs yesterday myself so i i'm glad you were able to get a few of them alright so let's do that that physical exam on you so your vitals look good you do n't have any fever your blood pressure heart rate is fine so when i press here on your belly does that hurt","1401":"a little bit alright so on your exam of your abdomen there is mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there's no rebound or guarding there is cva located near your flank tenderness on the right so that means that everything looks good but you do have what seems to be some inflammation of your kidney okay so we we were able to get a ct of your your side and it showed that you do have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size and it's located in the proximal right ureter and so that's that duck that passes from your kidney to your bladder alright i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so that means that there's not obstructing ureter causing swelling in your kidney which is which is pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone on the right so what i'm recommending is i want you to push fluids just to help facilitate you passing that stone alright have you been taking in have you been drinking enough water do you think so far","1402":"okay yeah i i want you to to drink try drink as much as possible just to see if we can get you hydrated and pass the stone what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na prescribe you ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you can take that as needed for pain i know you said you were in that much pain just in case it does start to move you're in pain i want you to take the ibuprofen i'm also gon na give you a strainer for you to strain your pee so we can see you wan na know when that that stone does pass gon na order a bmp and a urinalysis and a urine culture and based on what the urinalysis shows we can decide if i can decide if i need to put you on antibiotics if you do have an infection of some kind and i wan na see you back in about a week to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we can discuss further treatment such as a lithotripsy and it's it's a mainly minimally invasive procedure where we use shock waves to try to break up that stone but otherwise do you have any other questions for me","1403":"doctor: alright so we will see you back in a week or two and i'll have my nurse come in with that prescription and hopefully with all the treatment you'll be able to pass the stone okay alright","1404":"so barbara i i know you are here for some itchy scalp pain can you tell me a little bit about how you're doing","1405":"okay when did you first notice this","1406":"okay okay and have you seen ever noticed any rashes either when it first started or intermittently anywhere else","1407":"okay okay just mainly up underneath your on your scalp there uh and i can i can see that man that looks really itchy and scaly have you died your hair recently or used any other chemicals you you know like a new hair spray or gel","1408":"yeah i you know it's funny you say that because i keep saying i earned this gray hair and i'm gon na keep it so yeah have you tried any over the counter treatments i know there is a lot out of there something you know like a t gel or any of those other have those helped","1409":"okay okay let's talk about some other symptoms any joint pain fever weight loss","1410":"okay good and going back you know to your grandparents has anybody else in the family had similar symptoms that you're aware of","1411":"maybe your sister okay","1412":"okay okay now you know a lot of times we can see this with you know high levels of stress has there been any new mental or emotional stressors at work or at home","1413":"okay yeah i yeah we have a lot of that yes so let me go ahead and and look at this a little closer here the first off i wan na tell you the the vital signs that the my assistant took when you came in your blood pressure is one thirty over sixty eight your heart rate was ninety eight and your respiratory rate was eighteen so those all look good and appear normal and your temperature was ninety seven . seven and that is all normal now when i look at your scalp here i do notice that you have demarcated scaly erythematous plaques and that's just kind of explaining technically what's going on those patches and they're they're in a patchy format they're diffusely present across the back of your skull and that's probably why you you see all that that that white dander you know on your on your your clothes as you go through the day now lem me talk a little bit about my impression and plan i think that you have a scalp psoriasis and let's and here is my thoughts on that what i would like you to use is to use clobetasol that's a zero . zero five percent solution and i want you to use that twice daily on the the affected areas of your scalp so you're just gon na put this on and just kinda gently rub it in now i know to do it twice daily is going to be difficult but if you can do it first thing in the morning when you get up and then before you go to bed you know get a shower and before you go to bed that will be great i want you to continue to use t-gel shampoo that you listed when you first came in that's a very good solution shampoo for that and that will help with controlling a lot of this now there is no cure for this unfortunately and flareups can be unpredictable but we see that you know not a we do n't have a great finger on what causes the flare ups but i'm gon na give you some steroids that will help and we're gon na have to manage that on a ongoing basis but when you get do get a flare up i want you to be using these flare steroid that i give you as we go through that and then i wan na see you back here in three months or sooner if it gets significantly worse do you have any questions for me","1414":"yeah i want it's exactly what i want you to do i want you to use that that solution twice daily when you get that flare but then other than that just continue to use that t-gel shampoo","1415":"okay i'm gon na have my nurse come in and get you discharged but i the we will see you again in three months or and again please if it gets worse please do n't hesitate to call me and come in sooner","1416":"thank you","1417":"hey elijah how are you","1418":"so i see here that your primary care provider sent you over it looks like you were doing some yard work yesterday and dropped a landscape brick on your foot can what so what's going on with your right foot today","1419":"okay so you say you've injured your right foot before tell me a little bit about that injury","1420":"okay alright so when you dropped that brick on your foot were you able to get up and keep working or did you have to get off your you know not stop weightbearing and and get off that foot can you tell me a little bit about after the traumatic incident","1421":"so what have you been doing for the pain since the initial insult","1422":"okay have you taken any medications safe for example tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain","1423":"okay and then just out of curiosity you said you were doing some landscaping have you been over to landscapes warehouse new here in town my wife and i were just over there this last weekend and picked up a whole bunch of stuff you had a chance to make it over there yet","1424":"alright that sounds good now just out of curiosity can you rate your pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life","1425":"okay and then have you experienced any numbness or tingling of that foot since the incident","1426":"okay i'm gon na do a quick physical exam now your vitals look good and i would like to do a focused exam of your right foot the there is some bruising on the bottom part of your foot and on the top part as well and i do appreciate the associated swelling and i also recognize that you do have tenderness to palpation for midfoot now for your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is brisk in less than three seconds i do note a strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse with motor and sensation is intact for that foot i also like to call out the fact that it matches bilaterally which is important i'm gon na go ahead and review the diagnostic imaging results so we did a x-ray of that right foot and i do notice dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to your second metatarsal bone and the top of your foot this is where the metatarsals meet those cuboids okay so it where the bones come together in your foot now there are a lot of ligaments in your foot so i do want to order an mri just to assess if there is any injuries to those ligaments now based on your exam and looking at the x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery now the reason why this is important is if we have poor bone alignment or ligament healing you can this can lead to losing the arch in your foot you could becoming flat-footed and also developing arthritis now what's gon na be key here is the surgery is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly we are going to put them back into place using plates and screws now the key thing is going to be it's going to be outpatient surgery so it's going to be same day i'll see you in the morning and then you'll be discharged home that evening and we will do a follow-up i wan na see you in twenty four hours post procedure but then i'll see you again in two weeks you're gon na be in a cast and i'm gon na have you use crutches you're not gon na be able to weight-bear on that foot for six to eight weeks what we'll do is we'll advance your ambulating gradually based on how you heal and based on how you tolerate the procedure i know i have covered a lot of material quickly but this is really gon na be the best course of action for you to have a good outcome now do you have any questions come answers concerns before i have the nurse come in finish the paperwork and get you set up for your procedure which we are going to do tomorrow if you're agreeable to that","1427":"you could but what we found is the best outcome is aligning those bones with plates and screws to make sure that they heal properly so you have the best outcome possible","1428":"so what what we will do is the good news is we have an outpatient mri facility downstairs and i'm going to send the order down and we'll get you your mri this afternoon","1429":"doctor: alright thanks elijah","1430":"karen nelson is a 3 -year-old female with no significant past medical history who comes in for evaluation of a new right eye twitch karen is accompanied by her father hi karen how are you","1431":"hey dad how are you doing","1432":"okay alright so karen have you felt the twitch","1433":"yeah and do you have any pain when it happens","1434":"yeah i i i can understand that's because he loves you do you feel the urge to move your face","1435":"okay okay and so so dad how often are you seeing the twitch on karen","1436":"okay so karen how is how is how is soccer","1437":"does she","1438":"that is n't very nice you gon na have to show her that that's not very nice you're gon na have to teach her a lesson","1439":"is that your favorite at mcdonald's in the the mcnuggates","1440":"okay alright well you you made dad happy at least right","1441":"yeah well yeah who does n't well okay well hopefully we will get you you know squared away here so you can you know play your soccer and go shopping for dresses with dad so so dad tell me does the karen seem bothered or any other and have any other issues when this happens","1442":"okay alright has she has she otherwise been feeling okay since this started has she been acting normally","1443":"okay good","1444":"okay alright good so has has karen had any seizures in the past","1445":"no okay and then so tell me when the twitch occurs do you ever notice any you know parts of her like moving or twitching","1446":"okay okay yeah that would be great to see that because i wan na see what's going on so thank you for that tell me is there any family history of seizures or like tourette's syndrome","1447":"yeah so so toret is that it's a nervous system disorder that you know involves like repetitive movements or like unwanted sounds and it typically begins in childhood and i do n't know have you noticed anything like that with her when she was younger","1448":"okay now tell me have you noticed any other symptoms how about like fever or chills","1449":"okay coughing headache","1450":"okay how about any problems with karen's sleep","1451":"okay okay good let's go ahead and do physical exam on karen here alright karen i'm just gon na take a look at you and and ask you to follow some commands okay","1452":"alright can you follow my finger with your eyes good now can you do me a favor walk across the room for me great job okay now i want you to close your eyes and reach out your arms in front of you good now keep your eyes closed can you feel me touch you here how about okay how about there","1453":"does that feel the same","1454":"okay alright so i'm just gon na check your reflexes okay alright now on your on the neurological exam the patient is awake alert and oriented times three speech is clear and fluent gait is steady heel toe walking is normal and the cranial nerves are intact without focal neurologic findings there is no pronator drift sensation is intact reflexes are two plus and symmetric at the biceps triceps knees and ankles so this means everything looks good karen","1455":"good alright so i'm gon na go ahead and tell you what we're gon na do so i'm gon na tell you my assessment and plan here so dad so for the first problem i do believe that karen does have a tick eye tics are very common in children and as many as you know one in five children have a tick during their school years and tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging facial grimacing sniffling excessive throat clearing and uncontrolled vocalization i can say that essentially they're brief sudden and involuntary motor movements now we do n't have a full understanding of the cause of the tics but they typically occur around five to ten years of age but most ticks go away on their own and they disappear within a year so these are what we call transient tics and the best thing to do is ignore the tics so it does n't seem to be bothering karen and she seems to be doing well in school and activities so it may wax and wane over time but you might notice it more towards the end of the day when the child is tired so you may also you know see it if they're stressed so that's why it's important to just ignore it now when you draw attention to the tick it does make the child conscious so that can make the tic worse so we want to be careful again just to to kind of not to draw too much attention on it and do you have any questions for me","1456":"yeah i do n't think it's i do n't think so because it's it is the same part of her body that's moving every time that and she reports that it's somewhat of an there is an urge to blink her eye and some relief afterwards","1457":"not at this time because she seems to be doing well overall and the tic has n't impacted her school or her activities but if it worsens then we can consider some treatment okay","1458":"alright thank you you guys have a good day","1459":"doctor: bye karen","1460":"alright thanks for coming in today i see on my chart here that you had a bunch of lower respiratory infections so first tell me how are you what's going on","1461":"wow that is a lot so what did you do for some of those symptoms","1462":"okay so when you say a lot like how frequently does it occur","1463":"wow and how long do your symptoms normally last for","1464":"mm-hmm you mentioned that you are a farmer did you do you notice that your symptoms occur while doing certain things on the farm","1465":"alright do you wear a mask when you're unloading hay","1466":"okay yeah so like that your brother does n't either","1467":"alright so i know you said you were trying to like help out your brother like what's going on with him","1468":"mm-hmm okay alright do you have any other siblings","1469":"wow okay that's that's a lot of siblings","1470":"maybe maybe we could we could always stick them in they could get some work done the holidays must be fun at your place","1471":"you're right keep it in the family okay so speaking of family do you have do you or anyone have a history of seasonal allergies","1472":"okay and do you smoke","1473":"do you live with anybody who does","1474":"okay alright so okay so now i i wan na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out some of my findings just to make sure that i'm documenting everything and if you have any questions about what it is that i'm saying please feel free to ask okay","1475":"so i reviewed your vitals and you appear to be breathing a little fast your respiratory rate is twenty but but your oxygen is you're satting kind of fine at ninety nine percent on room air so i'm not too worried about that on for on your heart exam i do you have a regular rate and regular rhythm i do not appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops on your lung exam you know i do you do have some fine rales on your lung exam but no wheezes and on your musculoskeletal exam i do not appreciate any clubbing of your fingers so for your results i did review the results of your chest x-ray and i noticed some round glass opacities so let me tell you a little bit about like my assessment and plan for your first problem of recurrent lung infections your symptoms seem consistent with a condition we call hypersensitivity pneumonitis in your case another name is farmer's lung which you know is appropriate considering your job this could be caused by bacteria and or mold that is found in the hay when you inhale it it leads to an allergic reaction in your lungs this is why your symptoms occur every time you move hay for your current symptoms i'm gon na prescribe you a a course of an oral steroid this will help to decrease the inflammation that is occurring in your lungs i will also be ordering a cat scan of your lungs which will help confirm the diagnosis as as well a pulmonary function test to assess how severe your respiratory impairment is it would be best if you could eliminate your exposure to the hay or prevent further to prevent further damage to your lungs however if you are unable it's very important that you wear a respirator when moving hay around i know that that was a lot of information i think it boils down to pull in more of your siblings to help work around but do you have any questions","1476":"so ideally what we are doing i think this is the best course of action to deal with the deeper problem right of these infections and to kind of like clear up the pneumonia everything seems to hint on so what we're gon na do is treat your current infection we're going to either prevent you from being around hay or make it so that it's safe for you to be with hay and then we're gon na see like what we need to do moving forward does that help","1477":"alright","1478":"okay no problem","1479":"hi good afternoon joseph how are you doing today","1480":"okay does it throb ache burn what kind of pain do you get with it","1481":"okay sorry i got a text and","1482":"no i hate riding a bike i'm more of a runner","1483":"yeah those those are nice","1484":"does it does riding your bike bother your big toe","1485":"okay do do you wear clips or are you just wearing a regular shoe and on a regular pedal","1486":"okay okay the how is there anything that you were doing out of the ordinary when this started","1487":"okay do does even light pressure to it bother it like at night when you're laying in bed do the sheets bother","1488":"okay have you done anything to try to get it to feel better any soaks or taking any medicine","1489":"let me see your your foot here and let me take your big toe through a range of motion if i push your top to bottom","1490":"big toe joint that okay and let me move it up where as i bend it up does that hurt","1491":"okay so i'm moving it down here and it i've got about ten degrees of plantar flexion does that hurt","1492":"if i go a little bit further to twenty degrees does that hurt","1493":"okay if i push in on your big toe and move it back and forth does that hurt","1494":"okay if i push in between your big toe and your second toe here does that hurt","1495":"okay what about if i push on the other side here","1496":"okay and i'm feeling a little bit of bone spur here as well let me let me get an x-ray","1497":"and after we take a peek at that we'll develop a plan","1498":"so at this point what would i do if i'm going out of the room and then coming back","1499":"okay alrighty so taking a look at your x-ray and you do have you you have a large spur there on the top of your big toe joint","1500":"and you've lost a lot of the cartilage","1501":"and so you you've got some arthritis in there we we call this hallux rigidus and treatment for this to start off with we we put an insert in your shoe called an orthotic and we give you a little bit of anti-inflammatory medication or like a drug called meloxicam you only have to take it once a day","1502":"it's usually pretty well tolerated have you ever had any trouble with your stomach","1503":"i hope you do n't either one of the things that we get concerned about with an anti-inflammatory like that is that it can irritate the stomach so if you do start to notice that you're getting heartburn or pain right there","1504":"below your your sternum you would need to stop taking the medicine and give me a call","1505":"and i wan na see you back in two weeks to see how you're doing with that if you're not seeing significant improvement then we may have to talk about doing things that are a little more invasive like doing a shot","1506":"or even surgery to clean out the joint sometimes","1507":"i have to","1508":"i'm sorry","1509":"yeah that would","1510":"that would be surgery if if we went in and cleaned out the joint sometimes in really severe cases we even just have to fuse the big toe joint we put it in a position of optimal function and we fuse it there and then your pain goes away you lose some motion but you've already lost quite a bit of motion and and the pain goes away so that that surgery really is very effective but let's try to run from my knife a little bit longer","1511":"no i want you to be doing your regular activities i want to know how this because if i put you out of work can you come back in and say it feels better well is was it because of the treatment or because of the rest so no i want you to keep working i want you to do your regular activities and i really want you to put these orthotics to the test and this medicine to the test and we will see how you're doing in two weeks","1512":"very good we will see you in two weeks","1513":"russell ramirez is a 45 -year-old male with past medical history significant for cad status post prior status post prior rca stent in twenty eighteen hypertension and diabetes mellitus who presents for hospital follow-up after an anterior stemi now status post drug-eluting stent and lad and newly reduced ejection fraction ejection fraction thirty five percent and moderate mitral regurgitation alright russell hi how are you doing today","1514":"just alright how's it","1515":"how's it been since you've had your heart attack have you been have you been doing alright","1516":"okay good were you able to enjoy the spring weather","1517":"that will be fine i know you love walking the trails i know you like looking at the flowers because i think you you plant a lot of flowers as well do n't you especially around this time","1518":"okay well we'll we'll do what we can here to get you out and going doing all those fun activities again now tell me have you had any chest pain or any shortness of breath","1519":"okay alright now tell me are you able to lay flat at night when you sleep or","1520":"okay good how about are your legs swelling up","1521":"well that's cute were you able to afford your medications and are you taking them as prescribed","1522":"okay well very good i'm glad you're doing that good for you russell and and then please keep that up now tell me are you watching your salt intake and trying to change your diet","1523":"mm-hmm","1524":"there is a lot of salt and pizza and you know and you're gon na have to be able to avoid all the other salty foods as well so and i know that's hard but it's very important for your heart to be able to function at it's best right and you wan na be able to get out and walk you know walk take those walks again at the park and then you know do your photography so in order to do that we're gon na have to really cut back on those okay","1525":"alright so why do n't we go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here i just want to take a look at you your vital signs look good i'm glad to see you're tolerating the medication well i'm gon na go ahead and feel your neck here i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention and there are no carotid bruits on your heart exam there is a three out of six six systolic ejection murmur it's heard at the left base but that's pretty much the same as last year so we'll continue to monitor that okay let me listen to your lungs here real quick russell your lungs are clear so good good and your extremities i do n't see any swelling or edema on your right radial artery the cath site there is clean and it's dry and intact and i do n't see any hematoma so that's good and there is a palpable rra pulse so russell i did review the results of your ekg which showed normal sinus rhythm good r wave progression and evolutionary changes which are anticipated so let's go ahead and talk about my assessment plan for you for your first diagnosis of coronary artery disease we are gon na have you continue your your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily and we're gon na have you continue on that high dose statin that atorvastatin you might call it lipitor eighty milligrams daily and then also continue on that toprol fifty milligrams daily okay and i'm also going to refer you to cardiac rehab so for you to get some education about your heart and also give you the confidence to get back exercising regularly now i know patients love the cardiac rehab program i think you will do well does that sound good to you","1526":"alright so for your second diagnosis here the newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation i think your pumping function will improve in time you know they got you to the lab quickly so i think that heart muscle is just stunned and you're very compliant you're very good with your medications and following through with those so i think it will recover so that said i want you to go ahead and continue continue your lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i do n't think you need a diuretic at this time but i do want to add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and then you'll need to get labs next week okay and then we're gon na repeat another echocardiogram echocardiocardiogram in about two months","1527":"okay and then for your hypertension your third diagnosis of hypertension i want your to take your blood pressure just like you would you know every so often and then because your blood pressures actually seem fine at this time so we will continue to monitor that and i think you will tolerate the aldactone well as well","1528":"okay well you take care and you have a good evening","1529":"okay  good morning","1530":"sure absolutely what can i help you with today","1531":"okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now","1532":"okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night","1533":"okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens","1534":"okay and then when you use your inhaler","1535":"does it does it alleviate the problem","1536":"yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler","1537":"so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler","1538":"for the symptoms","1539":"and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so","1540":"okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that","1541":"okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening","1542":"okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems","1543":"alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having","1544":"okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation","1545":"okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out","1546":"and then we can talk a little bit more","1547":"i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs","1548":"and everything sounds good let me take a look at your eyes","1549":"and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that","1550":"i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears","1551":"and i'm gon na look in your mouth too","1552":"and throat looks fine no tonsils","1553":"lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach","1554":"everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal","1555":"everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal","1556":"it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair mm-hmm and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that in terms of the mood is this new for you","1557":"and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that","1558":"okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start","1559":"and we will do some screening questionnaires and and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too","1560":"alright sounds like a plan","1561":"hey jean how're you doing today","1562":"so i see here that you looks like you hurt your left foot here where you were playing soccer can you tell me a little bit more about what happened","1563":"okay so have you ever hurt your left foot before","1564":"okay and then so after the fall and the entanglement with the other player were you able to continue playing","1565":"wow okay and what have you been doing for the the pain since then","1566":"okay alright so without any ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is","1567":"okay and then with your ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is","1568":"okay so how long have you been playing soccer","1569":"well that's cool yeah we our our youngest daughter she is almost sixteen and she plays the inner marrial soccer league they are down at the rex center did is that where you started playing or did you guys did you start playing somewhere else","1570":"that's","1571":"that's awesome so just out of curiosity with the left foot have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or or any strange sensation","1572":"okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of","1573":"doctor: you're welcome","1574":"hi virginia how're you today","1575":"good so you know you got that knee x-ray when you first came in but tell me a little bit about what happened","1576":"okay did you fall to the ground or did you just kinda plant and he pushed and you went one way and your knee did n't","1577":"you did fall to the ground okay and did you land on the kneecap i mean did it hurt a lot were you able to get up and continue on","1578":"okay so you get off the off the court is jerry a good player you just got ta ask that question","1579":"okay okay well you know i love basketball i'm a little short for the game but i absolutely love to watch basketball so it's really cool that you're out there playing it so tell me about a little bit about where it hurts","1580":"on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything","1581":"you had ice and what","1582":"and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly","1583":"seven days ago okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago so i'm gon na go ahead and now i also see that you're diabetic and that you take five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day are you still you're still on that medication is that correct","1584":"and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home","1585":"okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all","1586":"okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt","1587":"yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this","1588":"you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today","1589":"okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal","1590":"okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me","1591":"yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball","1592":"okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment","1593":"okay i you know i'm i'm just thinking you know i need to get some new shoes for some of it my activities i love the i wish i could play basketball but i do a lot of bike riding so i'm always looking for anything that's gon na help me on the bike do you does your family have supplies like that","1594":"okay great great so i'll i i will let you know i'll just get on and take a look first but i'm gon na go ahead and get get you discharged i'll have my assistant come in we will get you discharged and like i said we will make an appointment for seven days and we will go from there any questions","1595":"doctor: okay great","1596":"okay raymond it looks like you've been having some difficulty swallowing over for a period of time could you tell me like what's going on","1597":"okay and when does it does it happen every time you eat","1598":"okay and what do you mean by bigger pieces of food like what's your diet like","1599":"wow that sounds kinda stressful like what are you moving for","1600":"okay so are you thinking of driving","1601":"yeah absolutely i can see how that would that would increase your stress but like with that have you lost any weight because of your symptoms","1602":"okay and do you have any other symptoms like abdominal pain nausea vomiting diarrhea","1603":"okay alright so epigastric pain alright any blood in your stool or dark dark tarry stool","1604":"okay alright so i'm gon na go ahead and do my physical exam i'll be calling up my findings as i run through it if you have any questions please let me know alright so with your vital signs your blood pressure looks pretty decent we have it like one thirty three over seventy so that's fine your heart rate looks good you do n't have a fever i do notice that in your chart it looks like you have gained you know about like ten pounds over the last month so i i do understand when you say that you've experienced some weight gain your you're satting pretty well your o2 sat is at a hundred percent so and then your breathing rate is pretty normal at nineteen so i'm gon na go ahead

this and put it into my my into my chart so neck exam you do have a little bit of swelling in your neck little bit of jvd no bruits your lung exam you have some crackles in both bases and some rales that i can hear and there are a little bit of intermittent wheezing as well on your heart exam you have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you've had that in the past otherwise regular rate and rhythm it does n't feel a regular your belly exam your belly's slightly distended there's no tenderness or guarding or anything like that so that does n't that looks pretty good on your leg exam you do have some one plus pitting edema or actually almost one and a half plus pitting edema in your both of your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign that means no blood clots otherwise neurologic exam is normal the rest of your exam is normal so what does this all mean so let me explain that so for the first problem the shortness of breath you know i think you have an exacerbation of your congestive heart failure what i'd like to do is increase your dose of lasix from twenty milligrams to sixty milligrams for the next four days i'm gon na have you check your weights everyday and also i'm gon na go ahead and have you use your albuterol and atrovent we had given you some inhalers in the past i can give you another refill if you need to help with that some of the breathing that you're having the shortness of breath so i'd like to get some of this fluid off you have you check your weights daily we'll have you increase your dose of lasix we'll have you use a breathing treatments and see if that helps your shortness of breath i'd like to have you come back in about couple days actually i wan na see how you're doing and if it does n't get better we may have to increase the dose or send you to the hospital okay","1629":"yeah so let's try to let's try to use the lasix and let's try to let's try to you know use the breathing treatments and and do that for the second problem the diabetes that we just talked about i like to go ahead and order another blood test another hemoglobin a1c i think we need to your blood sugars have been running a little bit high in the past and we've had a hard time but it's been a while since we checked your last one so i wan na check another one today to see where we are and when we have you come back in a couple days we should have the results back we can then adjust your metformin or we may have to adjust some of the you know add a different medication at that point but but right now i'm gon na order some blood tests we'll have you come back in a couple of days and then we can reassess at that point okay","1630":"yeah we'll probably do a fasting blood sugar we'll we'll order the hemoglobin a1c that should n't be actually matter because that checks long term but if we need your blood sugar may be elevated today i i would n't be surprised alright and i forgot to examine your back by the way so on your back exam you do have some tenderness in the paraspinal areas of your back in the in the lower back mostly no midline tenderness you have good reflexes so i think this is all muscular pain right now for your back pain i'm gon na go ahead and put you on some naprosyn and some flexeril which is a muscle relaxer i'm gon na give you some exercises you can do to help you get off the couch it'll also help your blood sugar and why do n't we have you if that does n't work the the pain medicine and the physical we can start physical therapy and see if that helps okay","1631":"any questions about that","1632":"i think it's a white pill and it's round","1633":"about this big","1634":"anything else gloria","1635":"doctor: alright thanks for coming in today","1636":"hey matthew how're you doing","1637":"i'm doing pretty good hey i see here in the nurse's notes it looks like you hurt your left ankle can you tell me a little bit more about that","1638":"okay now when you fell did you feel or hear a pop or anything like that","1639":"okay and then were you able to walk on it after the incident","1640":"okay and then have you done any or had any injuries to that ankle before","1641":"okay and then what have you been doing for that left ankle since then have you done anything to help make it make the pain less","1642":"okay so let's talk real quick about your pain level zero being none ten being the worst pain you've been in in your life without any medication on board can you rate your pain for me","1643":"okay and then when you do take that ibuprofen or tylenol what what's your relief level what's your pain look like then","1644":"okay now you mentioned going for a walk my wife and i've been on on back behind the new rex center where the new trails are have you guys been back there","1645":"yeah those those trails are great there's like five miles of regular flat trails and then there's a bunch of hiking trails that they've opened up as well it's a really great place man you guys need to get out there we'll get you fixed up and we'll get you back out there okay","1646":"so let's let's talk a little bit about my physical exam if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you your vitals look stable by the way a little elevated i know you're in pain on a focused exam of your left ankle now i do appreciate that there is ecchymosis or bruising over the lateral malleolus and there is some swelling i do i do appreciate some edema now you are positive for tenderness to palpation on the lateral side and the the soft tissue is swollen here the good news is i do not appreciate any laxity in the joint okay and i do n't feel any any type of bony tenderness to palpation of your foot now on the neurovascular exam of your left foot capillary refill is brisk less than three seconds and i do appreciate strong dorsalis pedis pulses and you do have motor and sensation intact which is good now it's important that they were compared bilaterally and they are yeah your your exam is the same bilaterally so that that's an important thing now we did do an x-ray of that left ankle when you came in so i'm gon na review those x-ray results with you now the good news is i do not appreciate a fracture or any bony abnormalities so that's a good thing right so let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem of your left ankle pain your symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex and the ligament on the outside of your ankle is what got stretched when you fell now the best treatment for this sprain is what you've kind of already been doing doing the elevation and compression and ice so we're gon na continue the rice protocol and i am gon na go ahead and give you an air cast just to stabilize that ankle i'm gon na prescribe you some crutches i want you to stay off that leg but i do want you to start walking as tolerated but it may be a few days before you feel like doing that now your symptoms are going to get better significantly over the first you know four five six seven days but i am gon na wan na follow up with you just to make sure you're doing okay so what i do is i would like to see you in two weeks and i'm gon na have you continue taking those nsaids as well to help reduce that pain and swelling any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in and get you fixed up","1647":"okay sounds good like i said i will see you in two weeks if you have any questions or if you have a lot of pain come back in we'll reevaluate otherwise i think you're headed in the right direction and i'll see you again in two weeks","1648":"doctor: alright thanks bye-bye","1649":"hey anna good to see you today so i'm looking here in my notes says you have you're coming in today for some right ankle pain after a fall so can you tell me what happened how did you fall","1650":"okay so have you been able to walk on it at all or is it you know","1651":"okay well you know that's not good we'll we'll hopefully we can get you fixed up here so how much how much pain have you been in on a scale of one to ten with ten being the worst pain you ever felt","1652":"okay and how would you describe that pain is it a constant pain or is it only when you move the ankle","1653":"okay alright yeah but yeah i can feel it here so it does feel a little bit warm so i said you've been in a little bit of pain so have you taken anything for it","1654":"alright has the ibuprofen helped at all","1655":"okay alright so i just want to know i know some of my patients they have like bad ankles where they hurt the ankles all the time but have you ever injured this ankle before","1656":"okay yeah yeah definitely if you if you ca n't walk on it we definitely good thing that you came in today and we were able to see you so have you experienced any numbness in your foot at all","1657":"okay that that's good yeah it sounds like you have sensation there so yeah that that's really good so let me do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals your blood pressure was one twenty over eighty which is good your heart rate your spo2 was ninety eight percent which is good that means you're you're getting all of your oxygen and so let me go ahead and look at your ankle real quick so when i press here does that hurt","1658":"alright what about here","1659":"okay so looking at your ankle and your right ankle exam on the skin there is ecchymosis so you have that bruising which you can see of the lateral","1660":"malleolus associated with swelling there is tenderness to palpation of the anterior laterally in the soft tissue there is no laxity on the anterior drawer and inversion stress there is no bony tenderness on palpation of the foot on your neurovascular exam of your right foot there your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch alright so we did get an x-ray of your ankle before you came in and luckily it's there is no fractures no bony abnormalities which is really good so let me talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for your right ankle pain your symptoms your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain have you sprained your ankle before most times people do the athletics play soccer it happens every so often but have you done that before","1661":"okay well you're one of the lucky ones some of my my patients that play sports they sprain their ankle seems like every other week so good for you so for that that that ankle sprain i just want to keep i want you to keep your leg elevated when you're seated and i want you to continue to ice it you can ice it let's say five times a day for twenty minutes at a time just to help that swelling go down i'm gon na give you an air cast to help you stabilize the ankle so keep it from moving and then i'll give you crutches and so i want you to stay off that leg for about one to two days and then you can start walking on it as tolerated tolerated so how does that sound","1662":"alright so do you have any questions for me","1663":"i mean it should take a a couple of days i mean i think in a day or two you will be able to walk on it but still think it will be sore for the next couple of weeks you know your ankle sprain seems to be not the worst but it's kinda you know medium grade ankle sprain so as i would say about two to three weeks you should be back to normal you will see some of that bruising go away","1664":"no because you need to go back to work because you work on the computer not running so","1665":"yeah you ca n't get a doctor's note so if you if i write a note i'm gon na tell your boss that you have to go to work","1666":"so i i would n't do that but yeah but otherwise if if if you continue to have pain after this week if you feel like it's not getting better please feel free to contact the office and we can get you back in and possibly do an mri if we you know need to","1667":"alright","1668":"anything else","1669":"doctor: alright thanks","1670":"hey gabriel i'm doctor scott good to see you today i know you've heard about dax is it okay if i tell dax a little bit about you","1671":"okay so gabriel is a 43 -year-old male today here for back pain evaluation and also has a past medical history of diabetes high blood pressure and high cholesterol so gabriel tell me what's going on with your back","1672":"okay are you a big gardener or this is something that you just started working in the yard","1673":"sure sure","1674":"yeah yeah that happens to all of this so when this back pain happened so it was basically you were lifting you were bending down to lift something up and you had the sharp pain going down your right leg you said","1675":"left leg okay got it sorry and any weakness or numbness in your legs or just the pain mostly","1676":"okay and any loss of bowel or bladder function at all or anything like that","1677":"okay and have you had any back surgeries or back problems in the past or this is kind of the first time","1678":"okay have you had any any have you tried anything for pain for this have you tried any any medications at all","1679":"okay got it alright well i'll i'll examine you in a second but before we do that let's talk about some of the other conditions that we're kinda following you for i'm looking at your problem list now and you've got a history of diabetes and you're on metformin five hundred milligram twice a day and your how are you doing with your blood sugars and your and your diet and exercise","1680":"okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that","1681":"okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under balance so i'll order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check that again today and and you know just reemphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important and then we'll have those results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay","1682":"for your high blood pressure your blood pressure in the clinic looks pretty good it's about one twenty over seventy right now we have you on norvasc five milligrams once a day how are things going with that are you are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all","1683":"okay is that new or is that been going on for a while","1684":"yeah i mean certainly it could be it is you know sometimes that medication can cause that so i'll i'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay","1685":"alright so and your anything else bothering you today","1686":"so let me examine you for a second i'm gon na go ahead and gabriel i'm gon na do my magic exam now let's pretend i i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings as i do my exam and so","1687":"exactly so your neck exam has no jvd there is no bruits that i can hear your lung exam no rales no wheezing on your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past so i'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam you do have some tenderness on the left paraspinal area right where i'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal you have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paraspinal area of your back when i palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam you do have this one plus nonpitting edema of your lower extremities which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign no signs of blood clot that's what that means so let me just review what you know explain what all this means so the back pain the first problem that you're here today for i think this is more of a muscular sprain i'm gon na recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory naprosyn five hundred five hundred milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it does n't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now i would start with that if that's okay with you any questions about that","1688":"okay for the diabetes the the second problem that we talked about today i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day why do n't we have you come back in about two weeks and we should have some of the results back and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that but right now we will continue the course and we will go from there okay for the high blood pressure you do have this one plus edema in your legs i'm gon na go ahead and order some blood work today i'm gon na go ahead and stop the norvasc and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide ten milligrams once a day and if that does n't get if the swelling does n't go away i'm gon na do some more testing for right now let's get some sort off with some cbc and a bmp i'm gon na check your kidney function i'm gon na get another ekg and also i'm gon na get a chest x-ray and we'll go from there but hopefully this will go away once we stop this medication since it started around that time okay okay and i think that's it anything else we forgot about do you need refills for anything","1689":"okay sounds great alright thanks gabriel good seeing you again","1690":"hi elizabeth so i see that you were experiencing some kind of injury did you say that you hurt your knee","1691":"okay skiing that sounds exciting alright so what happened what what's when did the injury like what sorry what happened in the injury","1692":"so we were downhill skiing racing at this point okay is it your left or your right knee","1693":"okay and does it hurt on the inside or the outside","1694":"okay so the medial aspect of the right knee when you fell did you hear a pop","1695":"okay alright","1696":"okay okay alright so we got we got ta pick one if it if it","1697":"a hundred percent so how about this right now you're like i what i'm hearing is that you're experiencing bilateral knee pain like both of your knees hurt but i'm assuming that like your right knee hurts more is that correct","1698":"gotcha gotcha okay yeah i think hmmm alright so we're gon na we're gon na go ahead and look at this sort of but on a scale of one to ten how severe is your pain","1699":"okay that's pretty bad alright and does it has it been increasing or like rapidly or slowly over the last few days","1700":"okay alright","1701":"okay what would do you know if you are doing something that would cause it to be an eleven are you back on your ski's","1702":"okay does it hurt more when you walk for longer periods of time","1703":"okay how long does the pain last","1704":"okay alright","1705":"okay alright have you done anything to help with the pain","1706":"okay alright thc cream is an interesting choice but do you think that's been helpful","1707":"alright have you taken","1708":"not a problem have you taken any medications","1709":"okay like vitamins or more thc","1710":"thc gummies","1711":"thc gummies from grandma that's an excellent grandmother that you have okay have you noticed any swelling stiffness tenderness","1712":"okay alright and then have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past","1713":"okay so you've had surgery before alright do you remember what kind of surgery","1714":"okay okay okay how so do you have any other exercises that i might wan na know about outside of intense gym and ski events","1715":"okay and how frequently do you normally ski","1716":"okay and then are you on any medications at this time other than the thc","1717":"okay alright what","1718":"okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my examination i'm just gon na call it out for the sake of being able to document it appropriately and you or just just let me know if you want me to explain anything further so with your knee i know that you said it hurts on the right inside a lot right so when i press on the inside of your knee does that hurt","1719":"okay and when i press on the outside of your left of your right knee sorry does that hurt","1720":"okay alright so when i move your your kneecap does that hurt","1721":"okay so does the pain radiate frequently","1722":"okay alright on your skin exam i do appreciate some mild swelling and bruising that's really interesting since it's been two weeks with your knee are you able to bend it","1723":"okay and then when you walked in on your gait i think i think i did appreciate a slight limp are you i i i i think you are you are protecting one of your knees does that sound familiar","1724":"okay alright and when you move your knee away from your body you're bending like your you're pulling it towards me does that hurt","1725":"okay and then when you pull your knee back towards you does that hurt","1726":"alright so pain on dorsiflexion but not on plantar flexion plantar flexion okay alright so what we are gon na do right now i think i'm gon na look at your x-rays but when i when i look at the results of your x-ray i do not appreciate any fracture what i am noticing is the development of a little bit of arthritis and that could explain like why you say that your joints hurt a bit more during like windy weather and what not so this is what we're gon na do for my assessment and plan right the first thing is i think you have a strain of your posterior cruciate ligament what that means is what that will mean for you though is that we are gon na continue to brace your right knee that's gon na hopefully take off some of the stress that you might be putting on it especially since you're limping i am going to recommend you for physical therapy i think it would be an i think it's a good idea to maybe start three times a week to get your strength back into your knee i would recommend not skiing or doing any gymnastics for now and i think that physical therapy will really help considering the injury that you had when you were fourteen i'm gon na prescribe you some medications i do n't necessarily recommend consuming gummies at the same time but the medications i'm gon na give you are gon na be meloxicam fifteen milligrams you're gon na take that once a day that will help with like the swelling and the bruising i'm also gon na prescribe you just like a higher strength nsaid so ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams a day you can take that twice a day as needed for your left knee i think you are i think you just kind of like strength a little bit but like not enough to necessarily require any kind of like medication or bracing i think you just take it easy on your body i know that you're like very active from what i hear and i i think that that's really exciting but i think you might need to listen to your body and give yourself a bit of a break you'll be able to do like several workouts when you go to when you go to physical therapy but you know let the yeah let your therapist be your guide about like what you should and should not be putting your body through does that make sense","1727":"alright do you have any questions right now","1728":"doctor: no problem","1729":"hi , brian . how are you ?","1730":"it's good to see you too . so , i know the nurse told you a little bit about dax .","1731":"i'd like to tell dax about you

just take a listen to a few things and check some things out , and i'll let you know what i find , okay ?","1754":"okay . so , on your physical examination , you know , i do appreciate some jugular venous distention to-","1755":"to about eight centimeters . on your heart exam , i do appreciate a three out of six systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past . and , on your lung exam , i do appreciate some fine crackles at the bases bilaterally , and your lower extremities have , you know , 1+ pitting edema . so , what does all that mean ? that means i think you're retaining a little bit of fluid .","1756":"okay ? i wan na just go ahead and look at some of your results , okay ?","1757":"hey , dragon ? show me the chest x-ray . so , looking here at the results of your chest x-ray , it does look like you have a little bit of fluid in your lungs there , and that can be just from , um , your heart failure , okay ? hey , dragon ? show me the echocardiogram . so , this is the echocardiogram that we did about four months ago , and this shows that the pumping function of your heart is a little bit reduced at 45 % , and it also shows that leaky valve , the mitral regurgitation that , that you have , okay ? um , so , let me just go over and talk about , a little bit , my assessment and my plan for you .","1758":"okay ? so , for your first problem , your congestive heart failure , i think you're retaining fluid , and i wan na go ahead and increase your lasix to 80 mg once a day .","1759":"i want you to weigh yourself every day . i want you to call me if you're gaining more weight .","1760":"and , i certainly want you to call me if you have any other symptoms of shortness of breath , and i wan na go ahead and order another echocardiogram , okay ?","1761":"hey , dragon ? order an echocardiogram .lastly , for your high blood pressure , it looks like you're managing it well at this time , okay ? so , i wan na go ahead and continue with the lisinopril 20 mg a day . i want you to continue to record your blood pressures at home , and report them to me in the patient portal if you see they're getting elevated , okay ?","1762":"does that sound like a plan ?","1763":"okay . um , i'm gon na be in touch with you after we get your test results , and we'll go from there , okay ?","1764":"doctor: all right . hey , dragon , finalize the note .","1765":"hi , ms. thompson . i'm dr. moore . how are you ?","1766":"all right , hey , dragon , ms. thompson is a 43 year old female here for right knee pain . so tell me what happened with your knee ?","1767":"okay . and did you injure yourself any place else ?","1768":"all right . and when did this happen ?","1769":"all right . and , uh , where does it hurt mostly ?","1770":"all right . and anything make it better or worse ?","1771":"okay . so it sounds like you fell a couple days ago , and you've hurt something inside of your right knee .","1772":"and you've been taking a little bit of ice , uh , putting some ice on it , and has n't really helped and some ibuprofen . is that right ?","1773":"okay , let's review your past history for a second . it looks like , uh , do you have any other past medical history ?","1774":"okay , and are you taking any medications for that ?","1775":"uh , digoxin ?","1776":"okay , all right . how about any surgeries in the past ?","1777":"all right . um , let's do your exam , okay ? so is it tender ... where is it mostly tender right now ?","1778":"all right , so if i bend your knee forward , does that seem to hurt ?","1779":"all right , how about if i twist it a little bit that way .","1780":"okay , okay . and how about down here ? do you feel me touch you down here ?","1781":"all right . any other pain down here in your calves ?","1782":"no , okay . so on exam you do have some tenderness over the medial portion of your knee over the medial meniscus area . uh , there is no , uh , there is a little bit of tenderness when i flex your , uh , when i , uh , uh , do some valgus stressing on your , on your leg . um , you have normal sensation . so let's take a look at your x-rays .","1783":"okay . hey dragon , show me the x-rays . so looking at the x-ray , um , of your left knee , uh , it appears to be there's no fractures there right now . i do n't see any , uh , there's a little bit of , uh , fluid , uh , but there is no , uh , there's no , um , fracture or there's no dislocation . everything else seems to be lined up properly , okay ?","1784":"so in summary after my exam , uh , looking at your knee , uh , on the x-ray and your exam , you have some tenderness over the medial meniscus , so i think you have probably an acute medial meniscus sprain right now or strain . uh , at this point , my recommendation would be to put you in a knee brace , uh , and we'll go ahead and have you use some crutches temporarily for the next couple days . we'll have you come back in about a week and see how you're doing , and if it's not better , we'll get an mri at that time .","1785":"i'm going to recommend we give you some motrin , 800 milligrams . uh , you can take it about every six hours , uh , with food . uh , and we'll give you about a two week supply .","1786":"okay . uh , do you have any questions ?","1787":"doctor: all right . hey , dragon , order the medications and procedures discussed , and finalize

back pain .","1792":"so logan , what happened to your back ?","1793":"okay ... and did you strain your back , did something-","1794":"okay , all right . and is it your lower back , your upper back

that you feel better in ?","1798":"okay , all right . well , um ... so how are you doing otherwise ? i know that , you know , we have some issues to talk-","1799":". about today . were you able to take any vacations over the summer ?","1800":"okay , well i'm glad to hear that . um ... so let's talk a little bit about your diabetes . how are you doing with that ? i know that- you know , i remember you have a sweet tooth . so ...","1801":"okay , all right . and how about your high blood pressure ? are you monitoring your blood pressure readings at home , like i recommended ?","1802":"okay , and you're you're taking your medication ?","1803":"okay . and then lastly , i know that you had had some early arthritis in your knee . how- how are you doing with that ?","1804":"okay . all right , well ... let me go ahead and- you know , i know that the nurse did a review of systems sheet with you when you- when you checked in . i know that you were endorsing the back pain . have you had any other symptoms , chest pain , nausea or vomiting-","1805":". fever , chills ?","1806":"no . okay . all right , well let me go ahead , i want to do a quick physical exam .","1807":"hey dragon ? show me the blood pressure . so it's a little elevated . your blood pressure's a little elevated here in the office , but you know you could be in some pain , which could make your-","1808":". blood pressure go up . let's look at the readings . hey dragon ? show me the blood pressure readings . yeah ... yeah you know they do run a little bit on the high side , so we'll have to address that as well .","1809":"okay , well . let me- i'm just going to be listening your heart and your lungs and i'll check out your back and i'll let you know what i find , okay ?","1810":"and kick against my hands . okay , good . all right . okay , so ... on physical examination , you know , i-i do hear a slight 2 out of 6 s- s- systolic heart murmur .","1811":"on your heart exam . which you've had in the past .","1812":"so that sounds stable to me . on your back exam , you know , you do have some pain to palpation of the lumbar spine . and you have pain with flexion and extension of the back . and you have a negative straight leg raise , which is which is good . so , let's- let's just look at some of your results , okay ?","1813":"hey dragon ? show me the diabetes labs . okay , so ... in reviewing the results of your diabetes labs , your hemoglobin a1c is a little elevated at eight . i'd like to see it a little bit better , okay ?","1814":"hey dragon ? show me the back x-ray . so in reviewing the results of your back x-ray , this looks like a normal x-ray . there's good bony alignment , there's normal uh- there's no fracture present . uh , so this is a normal x-ray of your back , which is not surprising based on-","1815":". the history , okay ?","1816":"so let's just go ahead and we'll- we're going to go over , you know , my assessment and my plan for you . so for your first problem , your back pain . you know , i think you have a lumbar strain from the lifting . so , let's go ahead . we can prescribe you some meloxicam 15 mg once a day .","1817":"i want you to continue to ice it , okay . i want you to try to avoid any strenuous activity and we can go ahead and- and refer you to physical therapy-","1818":". and see how you do , okay ?","1819":"for your next problem , your diabetes . y-you know , i think it's a little under- out of control . so i want to increase the metformin to 1000 mg twice a day . and i'm going to um ... um ... i'm going to repeat a hemoglobin a1c in about 6 months , okay ?","1820":"hey dragon ? order a hemoglobin a1c . so , for your third problem , your hypertension . uh ... i-i'd like to go ahead increase the lisinopril from 10 mg to 20 mg a day .","1821":"does that sound okay ? i think we need to get it under better control .","1822":"hey dragon ? order lisinopril 20 mg daily . and for your last problem , your osteoarthritis , i-i think that you were doing a really good job , in terms of you know what , monitoring your knee and uh ...","1823":"i do n't think we need to do any- any further , you know , work up of that at this time , okay ?","1824":"do you have any questions logan ?","1825":"okay . all right . so the nurse will come in to help you get checked out , okay ?","1826":"doctor: hey dragon ? finalize the note .","1827":"i know the nurse told you about dax .","1828":"i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you , okay ?","1829":"so ralph is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history

. i know . that's a , that's a hard thing to get over , moving kids out of the house and that type of thing .","1831":"so , um well , how are you doing from , you know , let's talk a little bit about your depression . how are you doing with that ? i know that we had put you on the prozac last year .","1832":"okay . yeah , i , i see that we have you on the norvasc . and so are you taking it at home ? is it running high , or ...","1833":"okay . all right . um , and then i know that you've had that prior lobectomy a couple years ago . any issues with shortness of breath with all the allergies or anything ?","1834":"okay . all right . so i , i know that the nurse went over the review of systems sheet with you , and , and you endorsed some nasal congestion from the pollen , but how about any shortness of breath , cough , muscle aches ?","1835":"okay , so you also have some shortness of breath with with exertion .","1836":"all right , and how far are you running ?","1837":"okay , great . all right . well , let's go ahead . i'd like to do a quick physical exam . let's look at your blood pressure .","1838":"hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . so here in the office today , your blood pressure looks quite well , at 120 over 80 . let's look at your prior trends . hey , dragon , show me the blood pressure readings . so , yeah , it looks , it looks good . i think you're doing a good job . it looks lower than it has in the past , so continue on the current medication .","1839":"all right , so i'm just gon na listen to your heart and lungs and check you out , okay ?","1840":"okay , so on exam , everything seems to be good . your heart , i hear a slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur , and your lungs sound nice and clear , and you do n't have any lower extremity edema . um , your ... you do have some pain to palpation of the , of the sinuses here , so i think you do have a little bit of congestion there . let's go ahead and look at some of your results , okay ? hey , dragon , show me the ekg . so they did an ekg before you came in today .","1841":"and in reviewing the results , it looks like your ekg is completely normal , so that's good .","1842":"so i'm not too concerned about that , that chest pounding . hey , dragon , show me the chest x-ray . and we also did a chest x-ray , which , which looks really good , uh , and you know , your prior lobectomy , there's no ... everything looks good , okay ? it looks normal . so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you . so for your first problem , your , your depression , it seems , again , like you're doing really well-","1843":". with your current strategy . let's continue you on the prozac 20 milligrams a day and do you need a refill on that ?","1844":"okay . hey , dragon , order a refill of prozac , 20 milligrams daily . from a ... for your next problem , the lobectomy , i think , you know , i do n't think we need to do any more workup of that . it seems like you're exercising a lot . your breathing function is fine . so , uh , i , i do n't think you need to follow up with the surgeon anymore . and then for your last problem , your hypertension .","1845":"you're doing a great job of keeping it controlled . i know you said you have n't been taking it that much on the weekends , but your blood pressure here looks good , and it's much better over the last several years . so let's go ahead . i do wan na order just , um , an echocardiogram for that murmur . hey , dragon , order an echocardiogram . and i'll just follow up with the results , and we'll go ahead and order , um , your routine blood work , and i'll be in touch with you through the patient portal , okay ?","1846":"all right . good to see you .","1847":"hey , dragon , finalize the note . the nurse will be in .","1848":"hi , ms. brooks . i'm dr. baker . how are you ?","1849":"is your , is your right finger hurting ?","1850":"okay . hey , dragon , uh , sharon brooks is a 48 year old female here for right finger pain . all right . so , tell me what happened .","1851":"and when did this happen ?","1852":"okay . and have you tried anything for this or anything made it better or worse ?","1853":"okay . and , uh , is it worse when you bend it ? or anything make it ... so , just wh-","1854":"okay . so , it sounds like you were skiing about four about days ago and you went over a mogul and got it hyper extended or got it bent backwards a little bit , ? okay . do you have any other past medical history at all ?","1855":"okay . all right . and do you take ... what medicines do you take for constipation ?","1856":"miralax ?","1857":"okay . miralax is sufficient .","1858":"and any surgeries in the past ?","1859":"okay . let's do your exam . uh , so , it's this finger right here . and does it hurt here on your , on this joint up here ?","1860":"okay . and how'bout right there ? no ?","1861":"right here ?","1862":"all right . uh , can you bend your finger for me ?","1863":"all right . and how about extend it ? all right . and can you touch your thumb with it ?","1864":"all right . so , on exam , you do have some tenderness over your distal phalanx , which is the tip of your finger . there is , uh , some tenderness over that joint itself . i do n't feel any tenderness over your proximal joint or your metacarpophalangeal joint , which is right above your knuckle . uh , you have some pain flexion as well . so , let's look at your x-rays . hey , dragon , show me the x-rays . all right . so , on this x-ray.everything looks normal right now . uh , i do n't see any fractures . everything lines up pretty well . uh , so , your x-ray looks normal with no fractures . so , based on the x-ray and your exam , you have some tenderness right here . i think you've got a little contusion right here . there's no fracture on the tip of your finger . uh , so , the diagnosis would be a right hand , uh , index finger contusion on the tip of your finger , okay ? so , i would recommend we get you a s- uh , aluminum foam splint and we'll get you some motrin . uh , we'll give you 600 milligrams every six hours and we'll take that for about a week . and if it does n't get better , why do n't you call us and come back at that point ?","1865":"okay . do you have any questions ?","1866":"okay . hey , dragon , order the medication and procedures we discussed . all right . and why do n't you come with me and we'll get you signed out .","1867":"doctor: all right . finalize report , dragon .","1868":"today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07\/01\/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia . hello , how are you ?","1869":"so tell me what brings you in today .","1870":"or how have you been feeling in general with this ?","1871":"okay . are there any other symptoms ?","1872":"sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ?","1873":"right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ?","1874":"yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ?","1875":"and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ?","1876":"well that's good news .","1877":"um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ?","1878":"all right . do you ever drink alcohol ?","1879":"okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ?","1880":"all right . and what are you taking ?","1881":"okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ?","1882":"okay . anything else ?","1883":"okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .","1884":"of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented .","1885":"all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs .","1886":"all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen .","1887":"is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ?","1888":"okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding .","1889":"actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why .","1890":"yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system .","1891":"we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better .","1892":"so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled .","1893":"um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ?","1894":"okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy .","1895":"all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work .","1896":"all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you .","1897":"you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper .","1898":"doctor: all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01\/20\/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .","1899":"patient , bruce ward . date of birth 5\/21\/1969 . please use my neuro consult template . this is a 52-year-old male with dia- newly diagnosed pituitary lesion . the patient is seen in consultation at the request of dr. henry howard for possible surgical intervention . mr . ward presented to his primary care provider , dr. howard , on 3\/1\/21 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months . he denied any trouble with headaches in the past . his past clinical history is unremarkable . worked out for worsening headaches was initiated with brain mri and serology where pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered . i personally reviewed the labs dated 3\/3\/21 including cbc , unes , uh , coagulation , and crp . all were normal . pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low tsh , all other results were normal . um , i personally reviewed pertinent radiology studies including mri for the brain with contrast from 3\/4\/21 . the mri reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm . the ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are lo- are noted . hello , mr . ward . nice to meet you . i'm dr. flores .","1900":"i was just reviewing your records from dr. howard and he's referred you because the workup for headaches revealed a mass on your pituitary gland . i did review your mri images and you have a significant mass there . can you tell me about the issues you've been experiencing ?","1901":"where are the headaches located and how would you describe that pain ?","1902":"okay . was the onset gradual or sudden ?","1903":"okay . can you tell me if the pain radiates , or if you have any other symptoms ? specifically feeling sick , fever , rashes , neck stiffness , numbness , weakness , passing out ?","1904":"okay . have you noticed any change in your vision or with your balance ?","1905":"okay . let's see , do you have any other medical problems that you take medicine for ?","1906":"i see . anyone in your family have any history of diseases ?","1907":"okay . um , what kind of work do you do ? and are you married ?","1908":"that's nice . um , do you drink any alcohol , smoke , or use recreational drugs ?","1909":"okay . um , well let me take a good look at you . um , now you'll hear me calling out some details as i perform the examination . these will be noted for me in your record and i'll be happy to answer any questions you have once we're done .","1910":"all right . the patient is alert , oriented to time , place , and person . affect is appropriate and speech is fluent . cranial nerve examination is grossly intact . no focal , motor , or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities . visual acuity and eye movements are normal . pupils are equal and reactive . visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia . and color vision is normal . all right , mr. ward . i'm going to review these pictures from the mri with you . um , now this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma , but there's no way to be sure without sending the removed adenoma to pathology to make the diagnosis , which we will do . um , here you can see it's a well defined mass . and it's pressing right here on what we call the optic chiasm . and today when i was having you look at my fingers , you could n't see them off to the sides , that's what we call bitemporal hemianopia . and explains why you have been bumping into door frames .","1911":"no because you're having this vision loss from the mass compressing the optic chiasm , the only option we have is to do surgery .","1912":"well there's no guarantees , but it is a possibility . i'm gon na refer you to the eye doctor for a full exam and they'll do what's called visual field test . this will map our your peripheral vision or side vision prior to surgery . and we can monitor after surgery to see if your vision is improving .","1913":"and let's discuss the surgery a little more . um , we would do what's called a transsphenoidal approach to do the surgery . this is minimally invasive and we go through the sphenoid sinus . there are some risks i have to inform you of . uh , risk of anesthesia including but not limited to the risk of heart attack , stroke , and death . risk of surgery include infection , need for further surgery , wound issues such as spinal fluid leak or infection , uh , which may require long , prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure . uh , seizure , stroke , permanent numbness , weakness , difficulty speaking , or even death .","1914":"okay . so i will have you see our surgery scheduler , deborah , on the way out to get you set up . we will get this scheduled fairly quickly so i do n't want you to be alarmed . um , she'll also get you set up today or tomorrow to have the visual field test and you may not be able to see the eye doctor until after surgery . but we have the pre-surgery visual field test for comparison after surgery .","1915":"yeah . come this way , we'll get your things lined up . please call if you think of any questions .","1916":"doctor: diagnosis will be pituitary adenoma . mr . ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has benign appearing pituitary adenoma , incidentally discovered during workup for worsening headaches . he is symptomatic with clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression , therefor surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated . end

it's nice to meet you .","1919":"so tell me about what brings you in today ?","1920":"okay . when did these four days of chest pain occur ?","1921":"of 2020 , correct ?","1922":"okay . can you think of anything that might have caused the chest pain ? did you wake up with it ?","1923":"okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ?","1924":"did they prescribe you any medications in the er ?","1925":"okay . i see .","1926":"interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ?","1927":"was the pain worse with eating or exercise ?","1928":"okay . any difficulty swallowing ?","1929":"okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ?","1930":"okay . so how has your weight been .","1931":"that's good . any in- ... issues with abdominal pain ?","1932":"okay . good . and how about your bowel movements ; are they okay ?","1933":"all right . are you aware of any family history of gi problems ?","1934":"have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ?","1935":"okay . if you wan na lay down here on the table for me and lets take a look at you .","1936":"so when i push on your lower belly , do you have any pain , or does it feel tender ?","1937":"okay . how about up here in your upper abdomen ?","1938":"okay . and even when i press lightly like this ?","1939":"okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ?","1940":"okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good .","1941":"so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days .","1942":"okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition .","1943":"so we could do an , uh , egd or upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis . but your symptoms occurred three months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes , so likely if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point ... by this point , and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor , uh , for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd . uh , with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option . but what do you think ?","1944":"that sounds good . um , so you can call the office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we'll get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow up with me ... follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints .","1945":"all right ? if you do n't have any questions for me , i'll walk you out to the check-out desk .","1946":"doctor: you're welcome . right this way . all right . uh , in assessment , please summarize the patient's history briefly , and let's list her possible etiologies such as , uh , gerd , dyspepsia , esophagitis , musculoskeletal etiologies , and anxiety . uh , suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition , plus or minus a contribution from her musculoskeletal etiologies . um , in the plan , include our discussion of the egd versus monderning ... monitoring for symptom . patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and

sounds like we're looking for continual- congenital anomalies wi- of the kidney and urinary tract . which is basically something is wrong with the plumbing .","1973":"so the only way to know that , is to do a kidney ultrasound .","1974":"okay . let me put that into the system , and then downstairs they can do the ultrasound .","1975":"okay , yeah . where do you all live ?","1976":"okay . anybody in

tell me a bit about what happened","1986":"wow okay so which wrist are we talking about left or right","1987":"okay and then have you ever injured this arm before","1988":"okay alright so on a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain","1989":"wow okay have you done anything to ease it","1990":"mm-hmm","1991":"yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen","1992":"okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry","1993":"okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere","1994":"okay any numbness any tingling","1995":"mm-hmm","1996":"okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright","1997":"okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt","1998":"and what about the outside does that hurt as well","1999":"are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like","2000":"okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up","2001":"alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt","2002":"alright and then lateral as well","2003":"alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist","2004":"okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you","2005":"okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down","2006":"okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to","2007":"pardon what","2008":"we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace","2009":"sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay","2010":"we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform","2011":"alright so what","2012":"you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks","2013":"yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of","2014":"these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions","2015":"okay how long is the vacation","2016":"okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks","2017":"okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do","2018":"no problem bye","2019":"doctor: the fracture appears extra-articular and usually proximal to the radial ulnar joint dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree if dorsal angulation is severe presenting with a dinner fork deformity ulnar styloid fracture is present","2020":"hey philip good to see you today so take a look here at my notes i see you're coming in for some right knee pain and you have a past medical history of hypertension and we will take a look at that so can you tell me what happened to your knee","2021":"okay well that that's not good do you","2022":"what part of your knee would you say hurts","2023":"alright did you hear a pop or anything like that","2024":"okay and did it was it swollen afterwards or is it looks a little bit swollen right now","2025":"okay so so far have you taken anything for the pain","2026":"okay that's it what would you say your pain score is a out of ten with ten being the worst pain you ever felt","2027":"about a four okay and how long ago did you say this was is this happened this injury","2028":"a week okay alright alright so we will take a look i'll do a physical exam of your knee in a second but i do want to check up you do have a past medical history of hypertension i'm seeing here you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was one fifty over seventy so have you been taking your medications regularly","2029":"okay so you might have a little white coat syndrome i know some of my patients definitely do have that so what about your diet i know we talked a little bit before about you reducing your sodium intake to about twenty three hundred milligrams per per day i know you were during the pandemic your diet got out of little bit out of control so how have you been doing how have you been doing with that","2030":"okay yeah we definitely need to get you to lower that salt intake get your diet a little bit better because the hope is to get you off that medication and get your blood pressure to a manageable level okay so we yeah we definitely can talk about that alright so lem me take a look at your knee i'll do a quick physical exam on you and before i do just want to make sure you're not having any chest pain today","2031":"are you any belly pain","2032":"no shortness of breath just wan na make sure","2033":"okay so i'm just gon na listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any wheezes or crackles listen to your heart so on your heart exam i do still hear that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and you already had that and so we we knew about that already so lem me look at your knee here so when i press here on the inside of your knee does that hurt","2034":"little bit how about when i press on the outs the outside gon na press on the outside is that painful","2035":"no alright so i'm gon na have you flex your knee is that painful","2036":"that's uncomfortable and extend it so that's painful","2037":"okay so on your knee exam i i see that you do have pain to palpation of the medial aspect of your right knee you have some pain with flexion extension i also identify some edema around the knee and some effusion you have a little bit of fluid in there as well so prior to coming in we did do an x-ray of that right knee and luckily you did n't break anything so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have what we call a mcl strain so a medial collateral ligament strain so when you fell i think you twisted a little bit and so it irritated you strained that that ligament there so for that what we can do for you first i'm gon na prescribe you some ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams and you can take that twice a day and that's gon na help you with that swelling and that pain that you currently do have i'm also gon na put you in a a knee brace just to try and support those muscles to allow it to heal and then i want you to ice the knee you can do that for twenty minutes at a time for three to four times a day that should also help with the the swelling of your knee for your hypertension now i'm gon na keep you on that twenty of lisinopril okay because you are taking it and you you're doing pretty good with it i also want to get you a referral to nutrition just to try to help you with that diet you know because right now you are your diet is little bit out of control so we just need to rain you in a little bit and hopefully you know with their help we can eventually get you off that lisinopril alright so do you have any questions for me","2038":"yeah i would yeah you can elevate your leg stay off your stay off your leg you know if you have any kids have them work out in the yard instead of you just to to for a couple of weeks it's a good thing if you want to do that","2039":"tell definitely tell him his doctor tell him i said it","2040":"doctor: alright so my nurse will be in with the those orders and we will see you next time","2041":"hi wayne how're you today","2042":"okay and how long have you had this pain","2043":"okay and do you remember what you were doing when the pain started","2044":"okay alright tell me have you ever had pain in that shoulder before","2045":"okay good but now are you able to move your arm","2046":"okay alright and and now are you having the pain all the time or does it come and go","2047":"okay and then tell me what have you taken for your pain","2048":"alright and and did that help","2049":"okay well i'm sorry to hear that you know you know renovating the basement it can be quite a task and it can take a toll on you","2050":"yeah what what are you doing with your basement are you are you doing like a a man cave or","2051":"that is awesome great well that sounds like fun i hope you get to set it up just the way you you would like for your man cave to be so congratulations to you there so tell me have you experienced any kind of numbness in your arms or in your hands","2052":"okay alright so let's just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here i did review your vitals everything here looks good now lem me take a look at your shoulder alright now on your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion and how does that feel here","2053":"okay sorry there is tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus but there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints you have good hand grips alright and then now on your neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is intact to light touch alright so what does that all mean well firstly lem me go ahead and take a look at your results of your shoulder x-ray here now i reviewed the results and there are no fractures so that's good so let's go ahead and talk about my assessment and plan here wayne so for your problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured the tendons of the muscles that help make up your shoulder muscles so i will be ordering an mri for your left shoulder to be sure that there is nothing else going on with your shoulder okay","2054":"now i'm also going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and during that time you may also continue to take tylenol now if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection for your shoulder which can provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan at all","2055":"now well many patients are very successful with the physical therapy those will those help strengthen you know they do a lot of strengthening exercises with you to help strengthen you know your muscles so that it's not your movements not always relying on those joints predominantly so we're gon na go ahead and start with that and then see how you do okay","2056":"alright okay well do you have any other questions for me","2057":"okay well i'm gon na have the nurse check you out and she's also gon na give you some educational materials on the physical therapy and what to expect and and then go ahead and schedule a follow-up visit with me as well after you you do your physical therapy okay","2058":"alright well have a good day","2059":"thanks","2060":"okay hi andrea well i","2061":"i understand you're you've come in with some right knee pain can you tell me about it what's going on","2062":"okay the left knee","2063":"okay well so where does it hurt like in on the inside or the outside or","2064":"okay well did you hear or feel a pop at any point","2065":"have you ever had any type of injury to that knee i mean did you fall or bump it against something or","2066":"okay and have is it painful have you taken anything for for pain","2067":"so is it interfering with your just things you like to do and","2068":"so i know you said that you like to do a lot of travel","2069":"is that where you would be kicking your leg out or something","2070":"and is and that you think that's when your knee might give out then or just not gon na take the chance","2071":"okay yeah that sounds like a good idea have you thought about even having a a cane just in case or do you think that's does that happen often enough","2072":"okay okay well so since you're in how about your blood pressure how how is it doing and have you been taking your blood pressures at home like we talked about","2073":"so what has it been running","2074":"okay alright and so what about your medication we have you on some medication for your blood pressure right","2075":"and what is the medication and the dosage that you are taking","2076":"that but yeah go ahead","2077":"yeah well that's good i i know you said you set an alarm on your phone to make sure that you get them taken at the right time so that's really good and how are your blood sugars doing how is your diet doing","2078":"is that in the morning when you're fasting","2079":"and are you taking your metformin","2080":"okay alright so are you are you eating like late at night or anything like that","2081":"okay okay alright well hopefully we can get you to feeling better okay so i want to do a quick physical exam really check that knee out so your vital signs look good they they look alright your temperature is ninety eight . two your pulse is seventy two respirations are sixteen blood pressure is one twenty two over seventy so that looks fine i'm gon na go ahead and take a listen to your heart and lungs so on your heart exam it's a nice regular rate and rhythm but i appreciate a slight two over six systolic ejection murmur at the left base here on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally okay now let's take a quick look at that knee so does it hurt when i press on it","2082":"okay can you bend your knee and straighten it out","2083":"okay i'm gon na do some maneuvers and i'm gon na just gon na call out my findings on this okay on your right knee exam no ecchymosis or edema no effusion no pain to palpation of the of the left medial knee is there any decreased range of motion do you feel you feel like you're you're able to fully move that as you should the same as the other knee","2084":"okay so no decreased range of motion negative varus and valgus test okay and so with your x-rays i reviewed the result of your left knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so lem me tell you a little bit about my plan so your left knee pain i think you just have some arthritis in that i want to prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams a day we might do some physical therapy for that just to strengthen the muscles around that area and prevent any further problems with that okay and so for your second problem the hypertension so i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams a day and order an echocardiogram just to evaluate that heart murmur alright and","2085":"for the diabetes mellitus i wan na order a hemoglobin a1c to see if we need to make any adjustments to your metformin and i'm also gon na order a lipid panel okay do you have any questions","2086":"doctor: we will get you scheduled for the echocardiogram i will have my nurse come in and we will get that set up okay","2087":"so beverly is a 53 -year-old female with a recent diagnosis of stage three nonsmile cell lung cancer who presents for follow-up during neo agit chemotherapy she was diagnosed with a four . four centimeter left upper lobe nodule biopsy was positive for adenocarcinoma molecular testing is pending at this time alright hello beverly how are you","2088":"you're good today yeah you've been going through a lot lately i know you just had your treatment how how are your symptoms","2089":"okay and how about fatigue have you been feeling more tired","2090":"okay and how about any nausea or vomiting","2091":"okay and i know you were mentioning a cough before how is it as far as walking are you having any shortness of breath","2092":"cough okay is it any mucus with it or is it a dry cough","2093":"a dry cough okay and tell me more about this sore throat","2094":"okay and when you mention drinking and eating is do you feel like anything is getting stuck there","2095":"okay okay alright and how are you doing as far as like just emotionally and mentally how are you doing i'm just talking a little bit about your support systems","2096":"okay and how about with family or friends have you been able to turn to anyone","2097":"okay excellent excellent and so right now you're on a combination of two different chemotherapies the cisplestan as well as the eupside and you had your last treatment just a few days ago but you're saying right now you've been able to tolerate the nausea and the fatigue","2098":"okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far","2099":"okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss","2100":"okay any questions for me","2101":"okay alright so i'll see you at your next visit","2102":"doctor: you're welcome and so now just","2103":"hi kyle how are you today","2104":"yeah i bet that did make you nervous i i see that she referred you for a low immunoglobulin a level is that your understanding","2105":"yeah that's a mouthful","2106":"it it's the the one of the antibodies in your body and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections it's a little bit low i'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you i just have a few more questions okay so let's start again here","2107":"i i think i would break that","2108":"if you can do that","2109":"yeah so we'll we'll just","2110":"you can leave it the way it is for now i just i think break that up","2111":"yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections","2112":"okay how about any abdominal infections","2113":"frequently","2114":"okay what about your family are are anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies","2115":"okay and how about do you have any other medical conditions","2116":"okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street","2117":"yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that","2118":"but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away","2119":"but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products","2120":"okay where did you go","2121":"hmmm i heard that's beautiful","2122":"okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial","2123":"no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you","2124":"no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency","2125":"well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency","2126":"you're welcome","2127":"hey lawrence how're you doing","2128":"so it looks like here that you came in to see us today for an evaluation of that right elbow pain can you tell me can you can you tell me well first of all what do you think has been causing that pain","2129":"okay and then so tell me a little bit more about that elbow pain where does it hurt exactly","2130":"okay so the inside of your right elbow okay","2131":"and then does the pain radiate down your arm or up into your shoulder or anything like that","2132":"okay and then do you remember any trauma did you hit your arm or elbow or any on anything","2133":"okay and you've never injured that right elbow before","2134":"alright so now let's talk a little bit about your pain and how bad it how bad is that pain on a scale from zero to ten ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life","2135":"okay and does that pain keep you up at night","2136":"okay and when you have that kind of pain does it keep you from doing other type of activities","2137":"okay and then and how long has this pain been going on","2138":"alright and anything you've done to help relieve or alleviate that pain any anything that that's giving you relief","2139":"okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam your vitals look good and i'm gon na do a focused exam on that right elbow i'm gon na go ahead and and and press here do you do you have any pain when i press here","2140":"okay so you are positive for pain to palpation you do note that moderate tenderness of the medial epicondyle now i'm gon na have you turn your wrist as if you're turning a door knob do you have any pain when you do that","2141":"okay now turn your wrist in so do you have any pain when you do that","2142":"okay so you do have pain you were positive for pain when you pronate that that that forearm okay i'm gon na go ahead and have you rest your arm on the table here palm side up now i want you to raise your hand by bending at the wrist and i'm gon na put some resistance against it do you have any pain when i press against your flexed wrist","2143":"alright so you are positive for pain with resistance against flexion of that left wrist so i let let's go ahead and review the x-ray that we did of your elbow the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality of that right elbow which is good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for the problem with elbow pain i do believe that this is consistent with medial epicondylitis which is caused by the overuse and potential damage of those tendons that bend that that bend the wrist towards the palm now i want you to rest it i'm gon na order a sling and i want you to wear the sling while you're awake now we're also gon na have you apply ice to the elbow for twenty minutes three times a day and i want you to take ibuprofen that's gon na be six hundred milligrams q.6 h. with food and i want you to take that for a full week now you're not gon na like this part but i want you to hold off for the next couple of weeks on doing any type of pottery work okay alright now what i wan na do is i wan na see you again in a week and i wan na see how you're doing okay","2144":"alrighty so i'll have the nurse come in and get you set up with that sling and i will see you again in about a week","2145":"doctor: thank you","2146":"alright david so you were just in

over ninety have you been taking those meds that we have you on","2149":"okay alright yeah i have you on bumex cozaar and norvasc does that sound right","2150":"alright okay yeah you need to make sure that you're you're taking those consistently that's really important and i know that we talked a little bit about watching your diet how have you been doing with that","2151":"yeah i i know it's hard around the holidays and everything but it is really important that we watch that diet what kind of things are you eating is it is it salty foods or pizza chicken wing kinda stuff or what are you standing or","2152":"mm-hmm","2153":"okay alright how are you feeling right now","2154":"sure yeah okay so you're taking your meds mostly we talked about getting you a blood pressure cuff at home did

david i'm looking at your results of your echocardiogram that you got when you were in the er and it it does show preserved ejection fraction of fifty five percent and normal diastolic filling and mild to moderate mild to moderate mitral regurgitation so let me tell you about what that means for the chf that you were in the hospital with sounds like you know based on your diet this is likely caused by your dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension that we've been monitoring so what i want you to do is continue your bumex two milligrams once daily definitely stay on top of that make sure that you get those meds in every time i'm gon na write you a consult to nutrition since it sounds like maybe we can give you some advice on on watching your diet definitely watching the

hope you feel better","2165":"hi russell how are you what's been going on","2166":"okay well does the pain move or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot","2167":"okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go","2168":"okay and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee","2169":"okay do you notice any blood","2170":"okay and what have you taken for the pain","2171":"okay and do you have any nausea vomiting any fever chills","2172":"okay is anyone in your in your family had kidney stones","2173":"and have you had kidney stones before","2174":"okay well i'm just gon na go ahead and do a physical examination i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm going to explain what what those mean when i'm done okay","2175":"okay so on physical examination of the abdomen on a abdominal exam there is no tenderness to palpation there is no evidence of any rebound or guarding there is no peritoneal signs there is positive cva tenderness on the right flank so essentially what that means russell is that you know you have some tenderness over your over your right kidney and that just means that you might have some inflammation there so i i reviewed the results of the ct scan of your abdomen that the primary care doctor ordered and it does show a . five centimeter kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter so this the ureter is the duct in which urine passes between the kidney and the bladder there's no evidence of what we call hydronephrosis this means you know swelling of the kidney which is good means that things are still able to get through so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan okay so for your first problem of this acute nephrolithiasis or kidney stone i i wan na go ahead and recommend that you push fluids to help facilitate urination and peeing to help pass the stone i'm going to prescribe oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain you can continue to alternate that with some tylenol i'm going to give you a strainer that you can use to strain your urine so that we can see it see the stone when it passes and we can send it for some some tests if that happens i'm also gon na order what we call a basic metabolic panel a urinalysis and a urine culture now i wan na see you again in one to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we'll have to discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shock wave procedure in which we sedate you and use shock waves to break up the stone to help it pass we could also do what we call a ureteroscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureter to retrieve the stone so let's see how you do over the next week and i want you to contact me if you're having worsening symptoms okay","2176":"hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that","2177":"okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics","2178":"okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now","2179":"okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that","2180":"okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park","2181":"absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there","2182":"okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure","2183":"correct","2184":"yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy","2185":"doctor: alright","2186":"hi richard how are you the medical assistant told me that you have a tick bite is that what happened","2187":"okay and have you had any fever or

about your high blood pressure did you buy the blood pressure cuff i asked you to have you been checking your blood pressure at home","2204":"okay and do you think that they are running okay","2205":"good i was just gon na ask you if you were taking your lisinopril so that's good okay and any side effects from the lisinopril since we started it i think we started it about a year ago two years ago","2206":"no side effects okay and then in terms of your diabetes are you watching your sugar intake","2207":"i am a big pie fan as well i know what's your favorite type of pie","2208":"i like it too alright are you taking the metformin twice a day","2209":"okay alright and are you checking your blood sugars pretty regularly","2210":"okay and do you do you know on average how they're running are they running below like one fifty or","2211":"okay your blood sugars are running below","2212":"good your blood sugars are running in the one twenties that's really good okay alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good i do think you're doing a good job with taking your lisinopril your blood pressure's about one twenty two over seventy right now which is right where we want it your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty seven again which is right where we want it and i do n't appreciate any fever today you you have a normal temperature at ninety eight . four which is really good so i'm just gon na be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally on your right knee exam i do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance over your right patella now does it hurt when i press","2213":"okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all","2214":"okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so do you have any questions about that","2215":"yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound","2216":"great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound","2217":"so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable","2218":"okay

think there's an additional injury or issue with your wrist , but because everything is connected , you're experiencing pain in your wrist because of your shoulder . we do see this type of issue when someone has a fall , so it's good you came to see us , you came in to see us so we could help .","2503":"well , we have a few options you can try . first option would be to start with physical therapy . i would recommend two sessions per week as well as any other exercises they give you to do at home . we can start there and if that does n't improve your pain , then we could try a cortisone injection .","2504":"all right . great . i'll get a referral order , and they will call you within the next day or two to get you scheduled .","2505":"mm-hmm . also , please continue to ice , especially your shoulder , and rest as much as you can .","2506":"give us a call or email us if you have symptoms worsen , if your symptoms worsen or do not improve with the therapy .","2507":"you're

ears ?","2516":"okay .","2517":"okay . and , any fever you've noticed ?","2518":"okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ?","2519":"and how about this morning ? did he eat his breakfast ?","2520":"okay .","2521":"okay .","2522":"how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps , or does he have pretty good energy ?","2523":"irritable because he is n't feeling good ?","2524":"okay , and just for the chart , is there anyone , anybody else exposed to him who has been sick ?","2525":"thank you .","2526":"and what medication have you tried for him ? anything at all ?","2527":"good , good . that's a good choice .","2528":"i see . and , any other medications ?","2529":"okay . that's good .","2530":"so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ?","2531":"is it a dandruff shampoo

ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down .","2538":"okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like .","2539":"all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine . you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus .","2540":"actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well .","2541":"but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough .","2542":"okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough .","2543":"yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby .","2544":"now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine .","2545":"yes , zarbee's .","2546":"i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand .","2547":"right , does that make sense ?","2548":"okay , great . and that way you do n't have to share , um , with his sister .","2549":"and since he's about half her size , we'll do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon .","2550":"yes . and so , if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for five days .","2551":"yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is , \" as needed , \" or anything like that .","2552":"you're welcome .","2553":"what i would do is use something like either head & shoulder's , or selsun blue , or nizoral ad . now , do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . um , cradle cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff . so , those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing 'cause they , um , they are all dead scales , and you still have to brush them off . so , continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil , or something that will help get the scales out , and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not every day , but maybe twice a week . so , two days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then , often , within six weeks or so , you'll notice that the-the cradle cap is just , um , not coming back anymore . but , he has to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes . so , just make sure when you're rinsing his hair you avoid his eyes .","2554":"all right . and , if it keeps getting worse , definitely let us know .","2555":"good . and , since they do n't have covid-19 , you can go right ahead and check out .","2556":"correct . we'll see you all then . bye randy , feel better .","2557":"doctor: you are welcome , and have a good rest of your day .","2558":"kayla ward , date of birth , 4\/28\/07 . mrn 3-8-4-9-2-0 . she's here for a new visit with her mother for acne located on the face , which started about two years ago and is present most every day . she has been using persa-gel and washing regularly , which is somewhat helpful . there are no associated symptoms including itching , bleeding , or pain . no additional past medical history . she lives with her parents and sister . they have a dog , bird , and bunnies . she is in 7th grade . she plays basketball and volleyball and tap . she wears sunscreen in the summer , spf 30 . no additional family history . hi kayla , i'm dr. juan price . i hear you are starting to get some acne on the face . how about the chest and back ?","2559":"so , it's not bad on the chest or back . you've used some over the counter items like washes and persa-gel ?","2560":"do those seem to be helping ?","2561":"good . what's your skin care routine like now ?","2562":"yes . what do you do for your acne in the morning ? and then what do you do at nighttime ?","2563":"when you say , \" wipe your face in the morning , \" do you use a product or just water ?","2564":"okay . and is today a good day , bad day , or an average day for you ?","2565":"acne is always good when you come to see the doctor . do you find that your acne flares with your periods ?","2566":"and do you get a regular period ?","2567":"how long have you been getting a regular period ?","2568":"okay .","2569":"yup , that will do it . is there anything else that you've noticed , mrs. ward ?","2570":"got it . okay . well , let's take a look then . full exam is performed today , except for under the underwear and under the bra . multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities . scattered skin colored papules . open and closed comedones . and erythmateous papules on the face , primarily on the forehead and with also some on the central cheeks and chin . the chest and back are relatively spared . and the remainder of the examination is normal . so , what i'm seeing from your exam today is mild to moderate acne , mostly comodonal with small inflammatory component .","2571":"yes . i would like to start with a topical therapy first . every morning , you will wash your face with a mild cleanser then use a moisturizer labeled , \" noncomedogenic , \" with sunscreen spf 30 or higher . this means it wo n't clog your pores . now , in the evening , wash your face with the same cleanser and allow it to dry . apply adapalene , 0.1 % cream , in a thin layer to the areas you generally get acne . i want you to start off using this a few nights a week and slowly work up to using it every night . if it is ... excuse me , if it is very expensive or not covered by insurance , you can try different gel over the counter . you can follow that with clean and clear persa-gel in a thin layer , or where you generally get acne . and then a noncomedogenic moisturizer . you're atopic retinoid will cause some sensitivity , so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside . it may also cause some dryness or irritation .","2572":"you also have multiple benign moles on your arms , legs , back and abdomen . this means they all look normal with no worrisome features . we will see if you have any progress over the next six months and follow up at that time .","2573":"do you have any questions for me ?","2574":"okay . if you have questions or concerns before your next visit , please call the office .","2575":"patient is julia jones , date of birth 5\/16\/1996 . she is a new breast reduction consult . hello , how are you doing today ? i'm dr. gonzalez . it's nice to meet you .","2576":"i'm doing good , thank you . so you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ?","2577":"okay . perfect . let me just get logged in , here . have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?","2578":"okay . and how long have you been considering this ?","2579":"well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .","2580":"yeah . so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having . and then i'll do a quick exam .","2581":"and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails . and , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?","2582":"okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company . and what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not . but we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you'll be on the new plan ?","2583":"okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .","2584":"so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?","2585":"okay . and in your neck and your upper back . and how long has this been going on ? would you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?","2586":"okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .","2587":"yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?","2588":"okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?","2589":"okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating .","2590":"okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?","2591":"and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ?","2592":"that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ?","2593":"okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?","2594":"congratulations . that's great . and then , um-","2595":". so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ?","2596":"okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .","2597":"okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now .","2598":"so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .","2599":"and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .","2600":"so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery .","2601":"you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you .","2602":"and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line .","2603":"okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility .","2604":"okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breastfeed after a breast reduction , and the reason is the breast is made up of fat . and it's also made up of a gland . and the gland is what produces the milk .","2605":"and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that .","2606":"and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated .","2607":"okay . um , the hormones of pregnancy , though , will change the breasts , so that's just something to be aware of , and i tell all younger patients that .","2608":"and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you'll have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple . generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction . and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised , and then it just takes some time for that to go away .","2609":"but other than that , you know , most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because the symptoms of the back pain , the neck pain , you can feel relief almost immediately . so do you have any questions , julia , about the process or anything like that ?","2610":"okay . and , i do think you're a good candidate for it . and i think you'll benefit from it as well .","2611":"i think you just have to do it when you are ready , when you know that you feel like it's a good time , because it is a commitment , and you will have some activity restrictions for about six weeks after surgery , uh , no heavy lifting . and i do say no driving for two to three weeks . and the drains stay in , like i said , for about a week .","2612":"okay . well , i think from this point , if you want to , we can take photos today , while you're here . i have all the documentation now in the note about your symptoms , and that's what the insurance company is going to look for . so thank you for answering those questions . so once we have the new provider , we'll go ahead and get that submitted . and then , when they approve it , um , what the office will do , is they'll work with you on a surgery date , and then we'll meet again right before the surgery to answer any last minute questions and go over the instructions in more detail , things like that .","2613":"doctor: that sounds great . and then we can get it all in process . and it was so nice to meet you . and catherine will be right in to get your photos . julia jones is a 25 year old female with symptomatic macromastia , presenting for evaluation of breast reduction . the patient has attempted nonsurgical treatments , but the minimal relief , and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty . her minimum required resection , based on a bsa of 2.65 , with the schnur scale is 1,792 grams , which should be attainable . given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above , there is potential for using a nipple graft . physical exam findings of breast , inspection reveals asymmetrical breasts with severe ptosis bilaterally . there is no nipple retraction or discharge bilaterally . no breast tenderness , masses , or axillary lymphadenopathy is palpable .","2614":"kelly wood . date of birth , february 15th , 1979 . established patient here for renal ultrasound because of hematuria . urine dipstick today . negative for leukocytes , nitrates , protein , ketone , bilirubin and glucose . color yellow and clear , urobilinogen 0.2 , ph 5.5 and specific gravity 1.020 . there is a trace amount of blood in the urine and intact . renal ultrasound impression . right kidney is 10 cm in length by five centimeter wide . there are no stones , masses or hydronephrosis . the left kidney is 10.8 centimeters in length and five centimeters wide . there is a six millimeter left renal stone non-obstructing . 533 milliliters pre-void and 0 milliliters post-void . hi , mrs. wood . i see you're just finished your ultrasound .","2615":"well , it looks like you have one stone in the left kidney but it's not obstructing anything .","2616":"how bad was your pain on a scale of zero to 10 ? zero being no pain and 10 being worse , as you can imagine .","2617":"are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back ?","2618":"that's good to hear . now , it looks like you're only taking alavert 10 milligrams a day and have no drug allergies . is that correct ?","2619":"all right , let's take a look at you today . let's use my default pe . well , mrs. wood , we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones . fortunately , you passed two last week and the blood has nearly subsided . you do still have one stone in the left kidney . since it's not obstructing or causing pain , i do n't recommend any surgical intervention at this time .","2620":"as we discussed last time , the formation of kidney stones can not be attributed to a particular cause . but several factors increase the risk , such as dehydration , family history , certain foods , digestive tract disease and certain medical conditions .","2621":"you should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day .","2622":"that would be 125 ounces of water a day and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like mountain dew .","2623":"great question . you should avoid food rich in sodium oxalate and animal protein . so that would be salty , processed food because they're high in sodium . ideally , you should consume less than 1,000 milligrams of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef , poultry , fish , and pork .","2624":"it's an organic acid found in plants , that when digested , it binds to minerals that stones are formed from . foods like spinach , chocolate , beets , rhubarb and soy products .","2625":"great . and here's a handout that you can look over . it goes over the dietary recommendations and what to avoid .","2626":"perfect . well , if you have any more questions . if you do n't have any more questions , you're all set . i wo n't need to see you back until next year , as long as you do n't have any more issues like bleeding or pain . if you do have any issues , you can always call the office sooner . and if you experience any severe pain or bright red blood in your urine , you should go to the emergency room .","2627":"doctor: yes , let's hope . come right this way and i'll walk you to check out . update pe abdomen . no flank pain . anti gu . normal vaginal exam . primary diagnosis is hematuria . secondary diagnosis is chronic urol ... urolithiasis . thank you . this completes mrs. wood encounter .","2628":"next patient is melissa sanchez . date of birth , 9\/23\/1962 . mrn : 5484367 . she is being seen in office today for status post mitral valve repair done on 8\/3\/2020 . at her previous follow-up on 9\/17 , we felt that she was doing quite well from a cardiac standpoint , and so we recommended she continue with the same medication . ecg taken on 12\/26\/2020 reveals atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response . t-wave inversion anteriorly . compared to the previous study , there are no significant changes , and please add in the history , patient has a history of mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation , history of diabetes , asthma , and recurrent chest discomfort with negative cardiac workup for coronary artery disease . ms. sanchez , it's good to see you again .","2629":"i am , thank you . you too . you're looking great . how have you been feeling ?","2630":"okay . well , that's really good to hear . i'm glad . are you having any new symptoms right now ?","2631":"okay . so , it does go away though ? how long does an episode seem to last ?","2632":"what is a while ?","2633":"okay . so , maybe it's a couple times a month you feel this way ?","2634":"understood . okay . are you taking your medications regularly ?","2635":"okay . that's great . and so , you're taking coumadin , right ?","2636":"are you having any side effects from the medications at all ?","2637":"okay . well , that sounds good . sounds like you're well on the mend . so , why do n't i start out , um , with the physical exam , and just check you out .","2638":"you're going to hear me describe things in detail or repeat things as i go to reference later for my notes .","2639":"okay then . i'm going to be using my status post template , ms. sanchez , please lie down on the table here and we'll get started . all right . can you turn your head to the left . head and neck no jvd detected . you can turn back now and just take a couple of deep breaths for me please . okay , that's good . and lungs have reduced breath , but auscultation and percussion are clear . okay . breath normally , i'm just going to listen to your heart . rhythm is irregularly irregular .","2640":"yeah , it does sounds kind of weird , right ? it's when your heart does n't beat with the correct rhythm , and whatever rhythm it does n't have a pattern to it . so , it's part of the atrial fibrillation .","2641":"yeah , it's not ideal . but , many people have a-fib are able to keep it under control with medicine and lifestyle changes .","2642":"okay . so , s1 slightly accentuated , no s3 . i'm going to touch your belly , and does any of that hurt .","2643":"how about there ? and your feet ?","2644":"okay , great . and trace peripheral edema on extremities . all right ms. sanchez , you can sit up now . so , it looks like your heart valves are working well and you are recovering from the surgery nicely .","2645":"yes . we are , we looked at your ecg taken earlier today , and we are seeing the a-fib , but it's being well controlled with the medicine , and you're taking coumadin , four milligrams , lasix at four milligrams a day , and the atenolol , you're taking that every day as well , right ?","2646":"great . it sounds like you're well on your way to recovery .","2647":"so , let's continue on your current meds . i'm glad that you're figuring out what your body can handle . definitely try to keep active as that will certainly help .","2648":"and that's about it . do you have any questions for me ?","2649":"well , i do n't think you need to come back soon . everything from a cardio perspective is fine . so , i think let's do a followup in about six to nine months .","2650":"you as well ms. sanchez , do take care .","2651":"judy gomez , mrn 869723 . date of birth , 5 , 7 , 1961 . she's in office today for ongoing management of psoriatic arthritis . hello , judy

, that's great to hear .","2654":"okay . how many times did you do that ?","2655":"okay . so it sounds like we're still on track for discontinuing the prednisone . we'll do that today and you can let me know how it goes on your next visit . and how about the methotrexate , do you think that helped with your joint pain ?","2656":"okay . and what happened ?","2657":"i'm sorry to hear that . and- and what did you do about the second dose ?","2658":"okay . that's good then . we do have to keep an eye out on it since it's a high-risk medication . do you have an appointment to get your blood drawn for the next time ?","2659":"okay . so we can do that for you too . uhm , so what questions do you have for me , judy ?","2660":"okay . that's probably from the prednisone , it can increase bruising .","2661":"yeah . unfortunately that can happen , but we're working on discontinuing that so let's see if the bruises do go away .","2662":"okay , judy , please , um , sit up here and i'll take a look . shoes and socks off please .","2663":"all right . let me see here . okay . so where is it hurting ? in your joints right here ?","2664":"okay . and how about when you bend the knee like this ?","2665":"okay , good . can you flex your toes please ? good range of motion . also ridges in nails , that's from the psoriasis .","2666":"okay . all right , uhm , ms gomez , it looks like we're moving along with your treatment nicely . we'll stop your prednisone and continue with the methotrexate . make sure to stop by the front desk and make an appointment for the blood work , and i'll see you in three months .","2667":"doctor: it was great seeing you too . thank you .","2668":"patient's name is diana scott . date of birth , 12\/8\/1920 . the date of service is 7\/9\/2021 . this is a new patient note . good afternoon . how are you today ?","2669":"good . well , what brings you in to see me today ?","2670":"okay . so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ?","2671":"got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ?","2672":"okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one . so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?","2673":"okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?","2674":"okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ?","2675":"okay . and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?","2676":"got it . all right .","2677":"okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?","2678":"okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?","2679":"okay . and how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?","2680":"okay . and so how about any passing out at all ?","2681":"okay , good . and how about irregular heartbeats ? do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?","2682":"okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ?","2683":"okay . and how long has this been going on ?","2684":"okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?","2685":"mm-hmm . okay .","2686":"okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?","2687":"good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?","2688":"okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?","2689":"okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?","2690":"all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?","2691":"okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ?","2692":"okay , i'll make that adjustment .","2693":"okay , i see .","2694":"okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?","2695":"all right . well , let's do a quick exam .","2696":"all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ?","2697":"okay , great . all right . well , that is it for the exam .","2698":"all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working .","2699":"and i can order that for today . um , do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long .","2700":"okay , great . so we will complete that today , um , to assess your overall cardiac structure and function , as well as , uh , the valve view of where diseased .","2701":"and some hospital outcomes and what we might suggest to fix that out , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called , um , aortic stenosis , and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open , um , quite fully . and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body , and that's called the aorta , into the rest of your body .","2702":"and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement , or we just call it tavr . and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve .","2703":"yeah , sure , no problem . and we do n't have to make any decisions today , just , you know , wanted to go over a couple of these things . um , but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement , or it's called an savr . but really , because of your age and medical history , um , unfortunately , that would n't be a good option for you .","2704":"yeah , agreed . okay . and , um , so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we're not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril . so just continue taking those as you are currently .","2705":"and then , it also looks like you're taking about 20 milligrams of simvastatin for your lipids . and i will pr- , um , defer to your pcp . however , given you are having leg pain in both your legs , and given your age and no history of coronary artery d- , artery disease , it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin .","2706":"yeah , um , possibly . he would have to evaluate you , but it is certainly something to discuss with him . so i will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations and then you guys can talk about the statin .","2707":"you're welcome . and then , um , lastly , your hyperthyroidism , uh , i see you're taking levothyroxine . and again , no change here and you can just keep taking that as you have them .","2708":"all right . so we will see you back here in about three or four weeks to discuss the results and your next steps . um , and we'll , uh , take care of your echocardiogram today . um , any questions ?","2709":"doctor: okay , awesome . all right . well , have a good rest of your day , and we'll see you soon . for physical exam , constitutional elderly otherwise no acute distress . cardiovascular normal s1 and s2 is preserved with a normal rate and regular rhythm . there is a 4\/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with , uhm , mild radiation to the carotids . neurologic gait is normal for age . for assessment and plan , probably one cardiac murmur . diana has a 4\/6 systolic murmur at the upper right sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids . this is most likely representative of aortic stenosis , for symptoms could be due to severe aortic , aortic stenosis . however , her s2 is relatively preserved , which would be more consistent with , consistent with moderate . some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction , so it is possible she , she did have an echocardiogram at some point in the past . she does not appear significantly volume overloaded today . her next problem is pvcs . her referral mentioned tachycardia . uh , her ekg today shows sinus rhythm with frequent pvcs , as well as an anterior septum infarct pattern . she does not have any significant palpitations and we will check an echocardiogram to assess overa- overall cardiac structure and function . depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis , we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation , or further , possibly a heart mon- monitor to assess overall burden of the pvcs . at this point , she's asymptomatic , so we will start with the echocardiogram only . her next problem , hypolipidemia , is managed by her pcp . due to bilateral leg pain over the last month , considered tavr evaluation following echocardiogram . statin could be indicated . and next problem , lightheadedness , dizziness . she is on meclizine for this . it is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness is related to the aorta stenosis , and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above . pvcs on her ekg could be contributing , but she does not feel palpitations . we will consider a monitor , but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above . follow up three to four weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps . end of dictation .","2710":"hey charles i'm using this cool new recording device to help me with my documentation is that okay with you","2711":"awesome how are you doing today","2712":"awesome. you

rash on your body there is no angioedema which is just swelling of your lips like you mentioned no audible stridor which is a bad noise in your airway when it gets swollen so that's good news if you just want to take a deep breath listening to your lungs on your lungs exam i do appreciate some faint expiratory wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields so i know you had a chest x-ray when you came in i'm looking at that chest x-ray right now and your pulmonary function test and they were both normal so let's talk a little bit about what i think is going on for your first problem you have newly diagnosed allergic asthma so i want you to continue the albuterol inhaler i do n't want you to wait until your symptoms flare up or are bad take it as soon as you start to feel any symptoms at all i'm gon na prescribe something else called singulair ten milligrams you might have seen some commercials for it","2730":"you take that once daily and that's gon na help decrease the occurrences of your asthma","2731":"i also am gon na proceed with allergy testing have you ever had an allergy test before","2732":"okay we'll start with skin testing and we'll see if we can target what the triggers in hopes in hopes that we can avoid any any other management and this can be successful if we ca n't figure out what it is from that we'll have to discuss more testing in your blood and do immunotherapy so i wan na see you next week to schedule the skin testing do you have any questions for me","2733":"so bryan it's nice to see you again in the office today what's going on","2734":"alright have you

pain with with the back","2747":"that's alright let's see how it turns out okay so how about if you if i push down on both your feet like this can you push back up on my hands","2748":"if i'm pushing down on your feet can you push push your feet back","2749":"alright so your dorsiflexion is normal looks like pulses are equal in all extremities you said you had a little bit of a tingling sensation in which leg","2750":"okay so some tingling in your right leg alright so i know that you had an x-ray when you came in because we always do x-rays when we have our patients come in of your low back and everything looks normal from that perspective so for your back pain sounds like you probably sprained your low back so i what i want you to do is let's rest it i'm going to prescribe some meloxicam have you taken that before","2751":"alright so i'll prescribe that i'm also gon na prescribe some physical therapy i know you said you have n't been overly active and your partner reported the same thing for a long time so we might wan na get you into some pt and hopefully get you back back in shape get you some stretches that you can do and some exercises and then you know if it's not improving i want you to send me a message and we can possibly look into see if there is anything else going on potentially an mri if it's still not improving does that sound like an okay plan","2752":"alright","2753":"alright you know let's give it a couple of weeks and let's give it two weeks and then call me back and we'll get you an mri if it's still not improving","2754":"doctor: alright alright hope you feel better","2755":"hey gregory good to see you today so take a look at my notes and i see that you're here you've had a nonhealing foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it","2756":"okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden","2757":"okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics","2758":"okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you","2759":"do n't recall alright","2760":"okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it","2761":"so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot","2762":"dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt","2763":"okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled","2764":"okay do you","2765":"okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it","2766":"around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt","2767":"okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening","2768":"okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound","2769":"alright do you have any other question","2770":"please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks","2771":"doctor: alright great","2772":"so stephanie morales is a 36 -year-old female today complaining of her ankle pain and she also has a history of diabetes and high blood pressure so stephanie tell me what's going on with your ankle","2773":"okay and so this happened couple days ago or how many days ago","2774":"two days ago okay and so it's your left ankle and it kinda just twisted underneath you on the kind of on the inside","2775":"and did you fall down or did you just kind of cut catch yourself","2776":"okay and were you able to get up afterwards or somebody helped you up","2777":"sure have you tried anything for pain or the swelling or anything like that","2778":"okay has that helped much or not really","2779":"okay and any pain above your ankle does it hurt on your on your calf or your lower leg at all or knee at all","2780":"okay got it and no bleeding or i'm sure it's a little swollen probably","2781":"well i'll have you take off your shoes in a second we'll examine you in a second but since you're here and i wanted to talk about some of your other things that you know we have n't i have n't seen you in a year so let's talk about your history of diabetes as well are you taking the metformin how's your blood sugars been how how're you managing that any issues with that","2782":"you're checking your sugars regularly as well","2783":"okay your hemoglobin a1c last time i looked at epic was about six . eight which is really good so i think you're doing a great job we had talked about you know cutting off the sweets and sugars and stuff like that and exercising so it sounds like you're you're you're doing a pretty good job with that have you seen the ophthalmologist recently for your eye exam for your diabetes checkup or no","2784":"okay alright so we'll so you do you already have an appointment or do you need to make an appointment for that","2785":"perfect excellent okay and how is your blood pressure been i know we watching it your blood pressure today looks pretty good it's about one seventy over i'm sorry one twenty over seventy you're taking norvasc any issues with that any do you need any refills or anything","2786":"okay alright well let me examine you here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my match exam and i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put that into my record okay so your neck exam is fine there is no bruits your lungs are clear your heart exam is normal you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is i think you probably have an ankle sprain but i would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone and i'm sometimes worried about a fracture so i'm gon na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you","2787":"perfect and for the diabetes keep the eye appointment that you already have you know continue with the metformin i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check some baseline labs as well since it's been a while since we checked them and then once if you have any issues or you know give me a call we can get you into the office and for the high blood pressure i'll go ahead and refill the norvasc today you're doing a great job with that it sounds like continue to monitor that if something changes certainly call me we can get you in sooner okay","2788":"sounds good sounds good good great seeing you thanks stephanie","2789":"okay hi wayne well i understand you're here for you've got a sore on your foot that's not healing is that right","2790":"so can you tell me about that how are you doing","2791":"okay and how long have you had the wound","2792":"okay have you had any kind of trauma to that foot","2793":"okay and so did your doctor put you on any antibiotics when they they saw your foot","2794":"okay now does it hurt","2795":"okay now have you had any other symptoms like fever chills drainage from the wound or anything along those lines","2796":"okay well are you still wearing those same shoes that cause the problem","2797":"i'm so upset too i love those shoes","2798":"okay so what kind of shoes are they","2799":"ah so where did you get them","2800":"they're pretty good about helping you to fit your fit you in a shoe are n't they","2801":"so what do you like about them","2802":"that's good so you've had some issues with stability sometimes or","2803":"okay okay well another question i want to ask you is how is your diabetes doing","2804":"okay alright well let me just do a quick physical exam okay for vital signs your temperature is ninety eight . one your vital signs look good your heart rate is seventy two respirations sixteen blood pressure is one ten over sixty five okay so on your foot exam let's see there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot it is just proximal to the right fifth to the fifth mtp joint and there is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue there's no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there's no evidence of fluid collection there's no necrosis there is no odor i do not appreciate any bony exposure on on vascular exam there are palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses there are no palpable dp or pt pulses but doppler signs are present okay so does this hurt when i touch it here","2805":"okay alright so i've reviewed the results your right foot x-ray that we did before you i came in the room and this shows no evidence of osteomyelitis which means there is no evidence of bone infection so that's really good so let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem your diabetic foot ulcer so i want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to your foot to see if you can heal this wound i'm also gon na perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue and then next i'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and i want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area okay so i do n't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see you again in two weeks so we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay","2806":"okay so for your diabetes it's gon na be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal so we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without a being too much but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin a1c into a little bit better level okay","2807":"alright do you have any other questions","2808":"hey william so i see that you injured your knee could you tell me a bit about what happened","2809":"okay alright and so do do you go to the trampoline park often","2810":"okay so this is the first time you'd ever done something like that","2811":"okay alright i just wan na get like a few more details do you like work out regularly was this for fun or for like an exercise class","2812":"okay and do you have like a regular exercise regimen at all","2813":"okay no that's fine this is not a place of judgment i just i'm just trying to understand like if a little bit more of the background okay so we went to the trampoline park which knee where did you hurt","2814":"okay your right knee and so based on like your inside and outside which part hurts more","2815":"alright so the lateral aspect not a problem and you said that you heard a pop when you landed right","2816":"okay have you taken anything for the pain","2817":"alright so did the tylenol help","2818":"okay alright and so hmmm when does it have you tried anything else like did you ice it use heat anything like that","2819":"okay that's fine and how long ago did this happen","2820":"okay alright so you put up with the pain for a week that's i'm proud of you for that","2821":"excuse me i feel rejected right now why why would you say something like that it's fine but you know i i like it when you're not here either because that means that you're doing a good job so let's see about like getting your knee fixed up but i want to talk about some of the other issues that you have first so we know that you have hypertension right and i discussed maybe you getting a blood pressure cuff because i needed you to measure those a bit more regularly did you get the cuff","2822":"no okay that's fine have you measured your blood pressure recently at all","2823":"okay are you still taking your medication because i see you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril","2824":"okay ra i'm not suspicious but we're just gon na go with that okay because looking at your vitals it it is of still a bit high i'm not really comfortable i see like a hundred and eighty over you know eighty and that's not where we wan na be so i wonder if we might need to adjust your medication but let's talk about your diabetes how are your blood sugars","2825":"okay what makes you think that have you been taking them","2826":"okay how often are you checking it","2827":"okay you might wan na switch to maybe two or three times a day but you know that's something i'm glad that you are measuring are you taking your metformin","2828":"okay and then i think we have you on five hundred milligrams correct","2829":"alright how is your diet","2830":"alright and okay not a problem so what is your do you are you measuring your calories at all looking at your macros are you just eating what you feel like","2831":"okay and are you do you know if you're particularly focused on your salt like is it like a low salt diet","2832":"alright so like is it a specific diet i just wan na make sure like are you on like the keto diet","2833":"okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam as i mentioned before your blood pressure is a little high as i listen to your heart i do like it's got a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur when i listen to your lungs they sound clear bilaterally i would like to look at your knee though so when i press here on the outside does it hurt","2834":"okay and then when i press on the inside does it hurt","2835":"alright can you bend your knee and straighten it","2836":"mm-hmm alright so are you having problems walking can you bear weight","2837":"okay so do you mind getting up and walking for me really quickly alright so i do notice that there is a slight gait like there is a small sorry you are correcting you do have a limp i i am a little worried about that but it's probably it's probably the superficial when i'm looking at your knee i do notice some like ecchymosis and edema that just means bruising and swelling along the lateral aspect of your knee i do n't notice any effusion and it looks like you have a decent range of motion but i do understand that you know you are experiencing pain with some movement okay i'm gon na go ahead and order an x-ray and when you come back we can have that discussion alright so i reviewed the results of your right knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so let's talk about my assessment and plan alright so for your first problem of right knee pain i think you have a lateral a lateral ligament strain i wan na prescribe some meloxicam which is gon na be fifteen milligrams daily for pain and swelling i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the area and to prevent further injury if you're still having pain we can do further imaging imaging but like this is a common injury that tends to heal on its own for your second problem with hypertension i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams and order an echo i am concerned that we might not be getting your blood pressure to where we need it to be so we might have to do some medication modification for your third problem with diabetes i wan na order an a1c i know that you said you have been measuring your blood sugars but i think this would give us a better image of what's been happening long term and i also wan na order a lipid panel in case we need to make any adjustments to that medication as well do you have any questions","2838":"doctor: alright awesome","2839":"hey matthew i see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your pcp sent you over to see me how're you doing today","2840":"okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there","2841":"so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version","2842":"okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at","2843":"okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes","2844":"okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me","2845":"okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life","2846":"okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better","2847":"okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs","2848":"that's okay","2849":"absolutely","2850":"so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here","2851":"okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there","2852":"okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please","2853":"alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan","2854":"doctor: alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you","2855":"hi jacqueline how are you doing today","2856":"okay so were you ever told in the past that you have hepatitis c","2857":"okay and do do you have any history like iv drug use known that you know or do you have any known to have any like hepatitis c positive partners","2858":"okay well very good you know congratulations on that that's that's a great great achievement so tell me though how about alcohol use","2859":"okay alright how about smoking have you ever smoked","2860":"wow okay alright so yeah you you definitely have decreased that so that's again good for you on that one so hopefully you keep you keep that up","2861":"so tell me do you have any other medication conditions","2862":"okay and and has work been not hard lately you've been busy it sounds like","2863":"okay

conditions what kind of conditions run in your family like is there do you have hypertension diabetes or","2866":"okay and depression okay alright well let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here i reviewed your vitals and everything there looks good so that's good and now on general appearance you appear in no distress and no jaundice on skin exam let me go ahead and listen to your heart here great on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with a two out of six six systolic murmur appreciate appreciated that's that has n't changed from last year so we will just continue to monitor that monitor that as well okay","2867":"alright now let me listen to your lungs here very good so your your lungs are clear with no wheezes rales or rhonchi and let me go ahead and listen to your abdomen great your bowel sounds are present your abdomen is soft with no hepatospleno splenomegaly ca n't talk to appreciated so let me now check your musculoskeletal exam here great i i did n't see any gait disturbance and no edema so that's great so jacqueline i did review the results of your recent blood blood work and your hcv antibody test was positive and your liver panel that was done showing an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so what that all means and let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan here for your first problem of hepatitis c your initial labs are consistent with hepatitis c so based on the the once i just discussed with you there now hepatitis c is a viral infection that affects the liver so you most likely may have had it for years now so the next step that i would like to do is to confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work that includes checking the hep c rna and also the hcv genotype okay now i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and i'm gon na do this by ordering a special ultrasound and with this information i'm gon na be able to know how to proceed as far as treatment","2868":"alright now i know that was a lot of information do you have any questions for me","2869":"yes so we can start with the same screening that you have had for you for all of them first okay","2870":"okay great so if you do n't have any other questions i'm gon na have the nurse check you out and get all that scheduled and i'm gon na see you in about three weeks","2871":"alright","2872":"take care jacqueline","2873":"alright good morning Julie how are you doing today","2874":"okay so i know you were sent here by your your pcp what was your understanding of why you were sent here","2875":"okay can you tell me a little bit about them what how do they how do they feel when they come on","2876":"okay do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse i know you said they they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse","2877":"okay and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches","2878":"okay okay and have you experienced any numbness or tingling to your hands or feet or your face","2879":"okay so you you like to run a lot what kind of do you do you use a a good shoe you know what kind of shoes do you use for your running","2880":"okay yeah i like to run too and i use nike","2881":"i used to get tumor guy but i i really kinda moved over to nike","2882":"that's good you know it is running is a great exercise","2883":"so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri","2884":"okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about","2885":"now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal","2886":"that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me","2887":"not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment","2888":"yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri","2889":"doctor: bye sorry","2890":"alright so hey it's nice to see you jack i know you've been experiencing some neck pain could you tell me what happened","2891":"mm-hmm","2892":"okay and so with this pain how long ago was the car accident","2893":"okay with this pain like on a scale of one to ten how severe is it","2894":"alright so where exactly is it on the side on the back","2895":"okay has anything made it better","2896":"mm-hmm","2897":"mm-hmm alright and did you say whether the pain was getting worse","2898":"okay are you able to turn your neck from side to side","2899":"okay and then do you have headaches","2900":"okay and so does the pain move anywhere like your upper back your shoulder","2901":"okay and then any kind of hearing any kind of hearing problems visual disturbances","2902":"okay have you do have you ever like played sports before or had like a sports accident before","2903":"okay and then when you got in the car accident did you end up going to the emergency room","2904":"i understand i understand okay was there any like swelling or bruising on your neck","2905":"yeah okay no just checking okay so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my physical exam so when i press on here on the side of your neck does it hurt","2906":"okay positive pain to palpation of the soft tissues of the neck what about when i press on your back or your shoulders","2907":"okay so when you flex your neck when you're touching your chin to your chest does that hurt","2908":"alright positive pain with flexion what about when you move it back","2909":"okay okay severe positive pain to extension okay so can you turn your head from side to side does that hurt","2910":"okay positive pain with rotation and then can you touch your ear to your shoulders","2911":"okay alright so positive pain on lateral bending wow this is pretty this is pretty serious not serious necessarily sorry about that so i reviewed the results of your x-ray but the results show no signs of fracture or bony abnormalities but let's go ahead and talk about my assessment and plan for you i believe what you have is something called neck strain for your neck pain i sorry treatments we are gon na go ahead and treat this a bit conservatively your i'm gon na put you on anti-inflammatories motrin six hundred milligrams and you're gon na take that every six to eight hours i also wan na give you a muscle relaxant called flexeril and it's gon na be ten milligrams and you'll take that every twelve hours as needed i'm gon na want you to try your best to to like relax your neck i'm sorry not to strain your neck anymore like to be conservative with how you move about and everything like that i also wan na order an mri just because you said you did n't go to the hospital or anything like that i just wan na make sure that you you're not suffering from like a concussion but this is something that's commonly referred to as like whiplash right your head just like it it just wiped essentially like back and forth to so severely and and that's probably what's causing your pain i think i wan na refer you to either physical rehab or a chiropractor once we get the results of the mri just to make sure that there is n't any impingement of like the nerves or anything like that do you have any questions","2912":"i do understand that some people have like reservations about going to the chiropractor but you know we do have some good ones that have like longstanding histories and patients that have had positive results from the experience but if you if you do n't like the idea of that we can consider other options like that rehab and physical therapy","2913":"alright any other questions","2914":"doctor: alright thank you","2915":"hey hi bobby how are you doing","2916":"i'm doing fine so i understand you're here having some left or some right shoulder pain that you've had for a few weeks now","2917":"okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before","2918":"mm-hmm","2919":"okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not","2920":"okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go","2921":"okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also","2922":"okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that","2923":"okay and does that seem to help or","2924":"well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and","2925":"wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then","2926":"yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or","2927":"okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven . eight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan","2928":"okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay","2929":"okay thanks","2930":"did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or","2931":"yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that","2932":"mister jackson is a 45 -year-old male who has a history of diabetes type two and mild intermittent asthma and he is here today with right elbow pain so hey there mark nice to see you again listen sorry you're having some elbow pain let's talk about it but i would like to record this conversation with this cool app that i'm using that's gon na help me focus on

ten","2937":"hmmm okay and do you would you say it's a sharp pain stabbing pain aching throbbing how would you describe it","2938":"okay alright and you let's see other than the the tennis you know increase in tennis activity you have n't had any trauma recently falling on it or you know felt a pop anywhere or anything like that have you","2939":"okay and and you said it's it's worse with movement better with rest is there anything else that makes it makes it worse or makes it better","2940":"okay okay alright yeah well i definitely i'm glad you're getting some exercise now that's good for your diabetes and all that and out there playing tennis kinda back back to the back to the old days for you right did do i recall that were n't you a big tennis player back in the day like state champ in high school or something","2941":"i did i did yeah that was that was crazy that was a great tournament what a what a finish unbelievable","2942":"yeah yeah yeah i do n't get out as often as i as as i like to but but the masters yeah that was that was amazing that was lot of fun to lot of fun did you catch it too","2943":"yep yep agreed agreed and so well listen we'll we'll hopefully get you feeling better here and get you back out on the court and out on the course and we'll talk about that but let's let me ask you about your diabetes a little bit a little bit here so how have your blood sugars been running mark have they been what in the low one hundreds two hundreds where are they","2944":"hmmm okay yeah yeah understood so those cadboy eggs they'll get you every time too right","2945":"boy my gosh yeah those are the best so those are those are deadly do n't tell my cardiologist so okay so listen you know i see that we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams once a day no actually last visit we increased it so i've got you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day correct you're still taking that","2946":"okay and but your blood sugars are a bit off you know maybe those the cadberry eggs so how about your asthma how has that been doing you know have you had any asthma attacks you're still taking flovent twice a day and the albuterol as needed","2947":"okay excellent excellent alright and i recall you know just kinda review a few things i i think you've got an allergy to penicillin is that correct","2948":"okay and then you you know your surgical history you had your your gallbladder out what about ten years ago i think by doctor nelson correct","2949":"okay and then let's go ahead and examine you alright so mark your exam is pretty much you know for the most part normal with a few exceptions on your heart exam you still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur and that's unchanged from prior exam we're watching that and so that just means i hear some some heart sounds as your heart is beating there i'm not too concerned about it as as that's not changed otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and your physical exam otherwise on your musculoskeletal exam on your right elbow you do have moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness of the right elbow and how about when i move this when i move your elbow like this does that hurt you","2950":"okay sorry about that so you've got moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow there is no palpable joint effusion and now what if i press against your wrist like so does that hurt you","2951":"okay alright sorry so that's you have mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist as well okay otherwise normal unremarkable exam and let's talk about your results now so your right elbow x-ray today shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality so that's good there's no malalignment or sign of joint effusion and otherwise it's a normal right elbow x-ray so that's reassuring okay and hey you know i meant to ask you you know and do you have any history of fever recently you know along with the elbow pain you had noticed a fever","2952":"okay great excellent alright so tell you what let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan here so for your first problem my assessment is is that you have acute lateral epicondylitis of your right elbow and this is also known as tennis elbow go figure right so this is due to overuse likely the increase in your your tennis activity which normally would be good but maybe we're overdoing it a little bit so i have a few recommendations i'd like you to rest your right arm as much as you can i want you to stop tennis for the next four to six weeks and please avoid repetitive stress in that right arm as well i want you to ice that right elbow for twenty minutes at least three times per day and this should reduce the pain and inflammation and then i'm also going to give you a brace for your right forearm and my nurse will give this to you before you leave that should help with the discomfort okay in that right elbow i will also write you a prescription for ultram and this should help with the pain i'll write you a prescription ultram fifty milligrams once per day that should help with your elbow pain so then i wan na see you in follow-up in four weeks and so we'll reevaluate your elbow at that time and if you we'll consider some additional imaging if needed possibly a physical therapy referral depending on how you're doing mkay now for your second problem of diabetes type two my assessment is is that your blood sugar is a little bit out of control mkay so we need to make some adjustments i'm going to increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice per day and i want you to check your blood sugar twice daily for the next two weeks and then let me know how your blood sugar is running and we can make some additional adjustments if needed but i will increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice a day now i'm going to also order a hemoglobin a1c level and and a cbc blood test today and and so we'll check those results the hemoglobin a1c and the cbc and then i'm going to also check a chem-12 blood test as well and now for your third problem of the mild acute intermittent asthma you my assessment is that it really remains under good control so let's keep you on that flovent and the albuterol no changes there and you can use those as tolerated it does look like you need a refill on your albuterol so i'm gon na write you a prescription for a refill of the albuterol and you can pick that up at your pharmacy as well so how does that all sound any questions for me","2953":"yeah yeah well","2954":"yeah well let's let's keep you active but take a break for a bit and let's ease back into it okay so it's great to see you and i'll see you back in four weeks let me know if you have other problems in the meantime","2955":"alright so how're you doing today angela","2956":"alright so looking here at your appointment notes it says you're you're here you think you have a kidney stone you had some in the past so we're gon na take a look at that and then you also have a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes we want to take a look at those as well so first thing what's going on with your kidneys you as what how long ago have you been feeling pain and and how's all that","2957":"okay so the case of kidney stones so have you had you said you've had them in the past and how often would you say","2958":"seven or eight kidney stones so do you think you passed it yet or is it still in the","2959":"this one passed how long would you say it took to","2960":"okay so are you still noticing any blood in your urine","2961":"alright are you still having pain","2962":"okay that that's that's that's really good did they do anything for you at the hospital giving you any medications","2963":"okay do you remember what it was","2964":"okay well that's good i'm very glad to see that you were able to pass that stone have you seen a urologist before about this","2965":"okay so yeah i know you keep having these recurrent kidney stones so i definitely think we can get you a referral to urology just to check up on that and also wan na do some labs as well","2966":"so i also see you're here for you have a past medical history of of hypertension and when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was a one fifty over ninety i'm reading here in your chart you're on two point five of norvasc","2967":"now have you been taking that regularly","2968":"okay maybe you have a little white coat syndrome some of my patients do have it i have it myself and i'm a provider so i definitely understand yeah i know we we talked about last time you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking those about two to three times a week so what have those readings been i'm usually like one thirty to one forty over sixty to seventy","2969":"that's that's that's not too bad i think when you first came in you were around like one eighty so it seems to be that that norvasc is is working for you how about your diet i know you were having a little issue eating some fast food and and cakes and cookies and have you been able to get that under control","2970":"okay so do you think you would be able to get that under control by yourself or would you do you think you would need help with that maybe a dietitian be able to help you out","2971":"yeah yeah definitely understand","2972":"alright yeah so i mean that's one thing we just got ta work one is your diet we try to keep you at least just twenty three hundred milligrams or less of sodium per day i know that's hard for a lot of salads and stuff i know it's hard for lot of people especially with all like the the prepackage foods we have around today so that's definitely something we we should work on","2973":"so let's also look here you have a history of diabetes and so you're on that five hundred milligrams of metformin daily now have you been taking that as well","2974":"so what have your blood sugars been running daily","2975":"okay so i'm looking here i think last after your last visit you got a1c now was six . seven so it's a little bit high it's gone down a little bit since you were first diagnosed with the type two diabetes a year ago so i'm glad we're making progress with that as well alright so i'm just gon na do a quick physical exam on you before i do just wan na make sure are you having any chest pain today","2976":"alright any any belly pain","2977":"alright so i'm gon na listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles listen to your heart so on your heart exam i do hear that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and we already knew about that previously so it has n't gotten any worse so that's good so i'm gon na just press here in your abdomen because that you did have those kidney stones does that hurt","2978":"alright i'm gon na press here on your back","2979":"okay so on your abdomen exam of your abdomen i'm showing no tenderness to palpation of the abdomen or tenderness of the the cva either on the right side so that that's good i think that's pretty much cleared up so let's we'll talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you and so my assessment you you did have the those kidney stones but i i think they are passed this time but i do want to get a couple of labs so we'll get a urinalysis","2980":"alright we'll get a urine culture just to make sure everything is is cleared up i also want to give you a referral to referral referral to urology","2981":"because you do keep having these all the time and so maybe there's something else going wrong and so they can help get that under control","2982":"of course yeah we can we can get you that road to doctor harris and","2983":"he's great he's he's he he he's great i've heard he does really good work so that'll be good so for the hypertension you seem to be doing well on the two . five of norvasc so we are not gon na make any changes to that do you need any refills right now","2984":"okay great so we we wo n't we gave you refills with that i do wan na give you a consult to nutrition","2985":"just to help you with that diet","2986":"because i think that's a major factor of us eventually getting you off of all medications","2987":"and then for your diabetes i'm just keep you on that on that five hundred of metformin okay i think you're doing well with that as well also but i do want you to start taking your blood sugars if you can take them before every meal","2988":"just to gauge where you are so you can tell how much food you should actually be be eating","2989":"alright","2990":"so how does that that sound","2991":"so you can you can come back in three months and we'll check up again i forgot you did tell me last time that you were having some issues with insomnia","2992":"how is that going for you is it still happening","2993":"okay alright and i know we talked a little bit before about practicing proper sleep hygiene you know just making sure that all of your electronics are off you know dark room","2994":"cool room have you been doing that","2995":"yeah i i know i'm like apple i do n't know if you have an iphone or not but i know apple has this the the sleep mode now do that disturbance so you put that on","2996":"interrupt you","2997":"okay have you tried taking melatonin to sleep","2998":"okay how about i do n't think i've prescribed you anything yet do you think you would need anything","2999":"okay that's understandable alright so for the last issue for the insomnia i'm just gon na have you take ten milligrams of melatonin as needed","3000":"and just try i guess the best as possible to practice the proper sleep hygiene so you can get to sleep at night and and feel pretty rested","3001":"alright","3002":"so do you have anything any other questions for me","3003":"alright so we will see you in three months","3004":"alright","3005":"hey betty how are you doing","3006":"i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms","3007":"okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems","3008":"wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now","3009":"okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or","3010":"is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that","3011":"okay and then when you use it at that time does it help","3012":"okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs","3013":"okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep","3014":"okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er","3015":"okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those","3016":"okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing","3017":"okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay","3018":"and then when was your last exacerbation","3019":"okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that","3020":"okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center","3021":"okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis","3022":"okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all","3023":"okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that","3024":"okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam","3025":"now i reviewed your vitals for today and your your blood pressure is good it's one twenty eight over eighty two your respiratory rate is sixteen and your oxygen saturation is ninety nine percent on room air which is a good thing i'm gon na take a listen to your heart here your heart is regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any ectopic beats or and i do n't hear anything like rubs murmurs or gallops which is good so i'm gon na go take and listen to your lungs here on your lung exam i do appreciate some diminished lung sounds throughout with the occasional slight expiratory wheeze and that's bilaterally so i hear that on both sides i'm gon na go do a quick neck exam here neck is supple trachea is midline i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy taking a listen here i do n't appreciate any carotid bruit now i'm also gon na take a look at your hands here i note strong bilateral pulses i do n't appreciate any clubbing on any of your fingertips which is which is important and i also note brisk capillary refill i'm gon na go ahead and review the results of your pulmonary function test that i had you do when you came into the office today and reviewing those results i do see that they are consistent with somebody who would be diagnosed with asthma so lem me go ahead and tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so now for your first problem of asthma your symptoms are consistent with moderate to intermediate or i'm sorry moderate moderate intermittent asthma and it's gon na be really important for us to be consistent with your inhaled inhaled steroid inhaler so i'm gon na need you to take that as prescribed and that's really gon na help cut down on those daily symptoms and needing to use that rescue inhaler that albuterol inhaler as frequently so the more you take and more consistently you take your inhaled steroid inhaler the less you will use your albuterol now it's not a fast acting inhaler like your albuterol but what is important is as going to be what helps you long term now if you do have an acute exacerbation so if you're having an acute issue with your breathing i do want you to continue to use your albuterol inhaler one to two puffs and then i want you to wait and see how your breathing is before you would take an additional one to two puffs we hope you have less of those acute exacerbations as you continue to use your inhaled steroid i'm also going to put together an asthma action plan for you and that's gon na help us look at your symptoms see where your your pain points can be you know like those being having issues with with cats or dust that type of thing and we'll work on how to handle those symptoms through that asthma action plan so do you have any questions comments or concerns otherwise i will see you in thirty days","3026":"you're welcome so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan for your first problem of asthma your symptoms are consistent with moderate intermittent asthma i'm gon na start you on flovent one hundred ten micrograms one puff twice per day that's gon na be important for you to be consistent with your inhaled steroid inhaler this is gon na help prevent those daily symptoms and from needing for you to use your albuterol inhaler or that rescue inhaler less frequently you can continue using your ventolin inhaler and that would be two puffs every four to six hours p.r.n . i'm also gon na put together an asthma action plan for you so we know what to do based on your symptoms i'd like to see you again in a month or sooner if you have any worsening symptoms does that sound okay","3027":"you're welcome i'll see you in a month","3028":"hello larry how are you doing today","3029":"i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially","3030":"okay and now can you describe the pain for me","3031":"okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain","3032":"and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area","3033":"okay now do you have any weakness","3034":"okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels","3035":"okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they","3036":"okay sure so tell me what is your day like","3037":"okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf","3038":"yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right","3039":"well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions","3040":"okay alright and do you smoke","3041":"okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here","3042":"i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit","3043":"sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that","3044":"well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year","3045":"alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour","3046":"alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection","3047":"alright thank you","3048":"hi kenneth how are you the medical assistant told me that you had some knee pain","3049":"okay so that was about five days ago then","3050":"last weekend okay now which knee is it","3051":"your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened","3052":"okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance","3053":"yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before","3054":"that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake","3055":"okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier","3056":"that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day","3057":"yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked","3058":"nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing","3059":"okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all","3060":"okay and what have you taken for the pain","3061":"okay and","3062":"okay and has that helped at all","3063":"okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here","3064":"okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press","3065":"okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt","3066":"alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that","3067":"i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions","3068":"okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye","3069":"hey kyle it's nice to see you today can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in","3070":"okay well first of all i'm i'm sorry that you're nervous and what we're gon na do is we're gon na partner together okay and i'm gon na be right by your side the whole time to hopefully make you a little less nervous and and recognize the fact that we're you're gon na have a big support team around you okay","3071":"so let's talk a little bit about how long you've had that cough before you went to see your doctor","3072":"okay that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking i love to bike myself i've got a track seventy one hundred hybrid have you been on the the new trails they opened it was the old the old rail the old rail road right away they've opened that up it's like sixty miles of trails","3073":"yeah i love riding over there way we will we will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride","3074":"that'd be great so i see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time and and and what do you do to to take care of your ra","3075":"okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking","3076":"okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that","3077":"okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies","3078":"okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that","3079":"okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process","3080":"i i know you're scared but we'll be right here with you the whole way","3081":"alright we'll get some paperwork and i'll see you again in a few minutes","3082":"so tyler is a 56 -year-old male who presents today complaining of difficulty swallowing and has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure so tyler tell me what's going on with your swallowing problem","3083":"okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing","3084":"okay and is it more kind of a like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that","3085":"okay how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids is there is there a temperature change any modification to that","3086":"okay alright so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all","3087":"okay that so no vomiting blood no coughing up blood or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all","3088":"okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this","3089":"okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven . four we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going","3090":"okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all","3091":"and how are the numbers looking","3092":"okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that","3093":"okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home","3094":"okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or get you referred to the er if needed any questions about that","3095":"okay and for the diabetes i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c i'm gon na order some more blood work today we'll check a kidney function and i notice that you have not had an eye referral so i'm gon na also give you an eye referral to ophthalmology to check your eyes for your diabetic for your for any retinopathy continue the metformin i'll have you come back in about a month and that way we'll have the results back for the blood test if we need to make any adjustments we can but i i wan na see you back in about a month and i think that's it for that any questions about that","3096":"okay and the high blood pressure i think you're doing great continue with the norvasc if you have any issues certainly call me but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that did we forget anything or do you need refills for anything","3097":"okay sure i'll get you a refill for norvasc we'll get that sent over to the pharmacy okay","3098":"doctor: alright thanks good seeing you thanks for coming in to them","3099":"so jerry is a 45 -year-old male who came in today with an ankle injury jerry what happened","3100":"absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way","3101":"good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad","3102":"okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too","3103":"okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all","3104":"sure so it does n't quite feel stable","3105":"okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches","3106":"alright well","3107":"yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again","3108":"alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly","3109":"yeah i i'm a dog walker as well so alright sorry for the bad news but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do","3110":"doctor: alright thanks","3111":"miss edwards is here for evaluation of facial pain this is a 54 -year-old male","3112":"good to see you mister edwards tell me what's been going on","3113":"okay great i would like to ask you a little bit more about that had in your face do you remember how long that you had it","3114":"mm-hmm do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face","3115":"okay do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face including the other side of your face","3116":"have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile or while you're doing other things any weakness there","3117":"does it happen on its own or there are certain things that trigger it","3118":"okay and anything that you've done to to that helps for a little bit when you pain excess","3119":"got it how long do these episodes last these pain","3120":"any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know","3121":"alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches","3122":"how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten","3123":"great . so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you","3124":"i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth . that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that","3125":"you can hear it on the other side as well","3126":"okay i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay","3127":"okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal","3128":"alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri","3129":"and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia","3130":"where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face","3131":"well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve","3132":"most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first . for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve","3133":"yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this","3134":"it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you","3135":"okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain","3136":"i think one month would be a great time to follow up","3137":"great i'll see you then","3138":"hi michelle what's been going on the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee","3139":"okay and were you able to ski down the hill or did you have to be taken down by the ski patrol","3140":"okay is n't that slightly terrifying they had to do the same thing for me and you're just kind of sitting there watching all of the trees go by so anyway so what part of your knee is bothering you the most is it the inside the outside","3141":"okay so it feels like it's gon na buckle","3142":"okay alright and are you able to bend it","3143":"okay and how about straightening it are you able to straighten it at all","3144":"okay alright now do you have any numbing or tingling in your toes","3145":"okay and can you feel your toes okay","3146":"okay alright now are you a pretty active person you said you were skiing do you do what kind of other activities do you do","3147":"okay do you have twins","3148":"nice that's great","3149":"so okay and what's your support like at home who is who is able to help out are you still doing that kind of hobbling around on crutches or","3150":"okay alright and did the ski patrol give you crutches i i see you have them here with you okay alright great and are you otherwise generally healthy","3151":"okay and no high blood pressure diabetes anything like that","3152":"no okay alright and well i i wan na go ahead let me just do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay alright so on your heart exam your heart sounds in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation and remind me what knee did you injure again","3153":"your right knee okay so on your right knee examination i do appreciate some edema and an effusion over the right knee does it hurt when i press","3154":"okay there is pain to palpation of the right lateral knee there is decreased flexion and extension there is a positive lachman sign there is a palpable palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is no leg edema in the ankle okay well let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and you know my plan for you so you know i know that you had the x-ray done of your of your right knee that did n't show any bony abnormality but i i'm concerned that you have ruptured your your acl or your anterior cruciate ligament that's like a major ligament that helps connect and helps your knee move back and forth so i wan na go ahead and order a knee mri just so that we can get a a a good look and just you know confirm that physical exam okay now some people can have a normal physical exam and their acl can still be torn but you do have a lot of pain on the lateral aspect of your knee so i wan na make sure if there make sure that there is not any other structures that have been damaged by this accident okay i wan na go ahead and you know are you what are you taking for the pain","3155":"is that helping","3156":"okay alright do you want something stronger","3157":"alright so let's just continue with ibuprofen you can take you know six hundred to eight hundred milligrams every eight hours as needed i wan na go ahead and put you in a brace that's gon na help your knee feel a bit more supported okay and let's go ahead and i'm hoping that we can get this mri done in you know the next couple days and then we can have a conversation about what needs to be done now you said that you are are are you know obviously a very active active mom any other exercise or anything else that that i should be aware of that you do just wondering in terms of which kind of graft we would use to fix this with your with your acl being injured","3158":"okay alright alright do you have any questions about anything","3159":"okay alright so i'll see you again soon okay","3160":"doctor: alright take care bye","3161":"hey brandon you know glad to see you in here today i see on your chart that you're experiencing some neck pain could you tell me a

had a car crash in february","3168":"okay so let's let's try with this one see what happens hopefully you remember i need you to start writing down these car crashes that this is becoming a thing but you know it's okay so let's let's say maybe you had a","3169":"no there's no judgment here whatsoever i want to make sure that i'm giving you the best advise possible and in order to do that i need the most information that you can provide me makes sense","3170":"alright so we're gon na say hope maybe that you had a car crash and we can verify this in february of this year and you've been experiencing some neck pain since then right","3171":"okay alright on a scale of one to ten what ten is your arm is being cut off by a chainsaw severe how bad is your pain","3172":"okay terrible pain now i know you mentioned you had previous car crashes and you've been to therapy has anyone prescribed you any medication it's you said you went to a pain clinic yes","3173":"okay alright and so we

sorry if these questions seem like frustrating i would just wan na make sure that i understand what the problem is so","3182":"i mean okay so you know what like maybe maybe pamela would be better like we could maybe talk talk about a referral if that would make you more comfortable","3183":"then you're stuck with me okay i'm so sorry but here it's we're gon na try and make it as good as possible alright so last thing i do wan na do my physical exam alright and i need you to let me know as as much as you as much as you can verbalize right so when i push here in the middle of your neck on top of the bone does it hurt","3184":"okay alright sorry what about on the side does that hurt","3185":"okay so pain on palpation both on the bony process and on the muscle can you move your neck from side to side can you move your neck can you swive it side to side no no alright so i'm i'm seeing i'm seeing some range of movement moderate range of movement that's fine okay i so when can you bend your neck forward that that's your whole body just just the neck are you capable of bending up","3186":"okay it really hurts to bend forward and backwards okay alright so i'm just gon na make a little note here i do n't i do n't see any bruising i'm not noticing any swelling there is i i do n't see any laceration what","3187":"okay sometimes alright that's fine i i just i'm not seeing one here today so that's okay alright so with that being said i do wan na ask have you been experiencing any fatigue are you tired","3188":"okay alright just making sure okay so this is what this is my assessment and plan this is what we are gon na do i want to be able to like we had you do an x-ray before you came in here and looking at it i'm not noticing any fracture that's a really good sign considering how many car accidents we've been in lately","3189":"absolutely no i we're gon na address the pain so for my first so looking at your imaging results though i'm not seeing a fracture that's a great sign so for your first diagnosis i'm gon na say that you have what is called a neck sprain that","3190":"no not by any means i am saying","3191":"yes and your pain can be explained by multiple things but thankfully it's not a broken neck is that okay","3192":"alright so what we are gon na do when we are gon na like try and treat this as conservatively as possible","3193":"if pamela said it's broken then you know what this is what we're gon na do we're gon na order something called a ct that's gon na give us even nope you know what let's upgrade to an mri it's gon na give us the most thorough image of everything that's going on the heart and the soft tissues is that gon na is that so that way we can really get a good image of what's happening inside right","3194":"not a problem we're we're gon na make your lawyer happy next step we are going to try working like from the outside in so i do need you to work on getting like you're you're saying you've seen some bruising and some swelling yourself so i want you to put ice on that whenever you're experiencing that in the moment when you wake up i want you to do your best to just like i'm gon na give you some exercises on the sheet and i want you to roll through these exercises every morning right to just get some like movement and like free frenosive movement back into your neck i also wan na put you on a couple medications now i know that you said you were on fentanyl before that's a bit extreme and i i want i i i wan na like monitor this a little more conservatively so what we're gon na start with is something called robaxin","3195":"you know we can refer you to pain medicine if it really is getting that complicated but for this current period we're gon na put you on some robaxin it's gon na be fifteen hundred milligrams and you're gon na take that six to eight hours every six to eight hours and that really should help kinda relax the muscles in the area take off some of that tension and really help with that pain if you're noticing that the robaxin still is n't helping maybe then we can start we can like start using like a heat pad or maybe some icyhot the biofreeze is a really good one to kinda help with that and then we will refer you to physical therapy i think with the mri we can start evaluating maybe some additional steps so rather than you having to like take that fentanyl because i do n't want you to be in danger right like people i do n't want you to get rubbed so what we could explore are local injections right and we can refer you to pain medication and see about like locally injecting the area and that should be able to help you out hopefully with this","3196":"okay so if it's if it's that bad let's wait for the mri result we're gon na give you off for work because you know you ca n't move and we'll see what the mri says about what whether or not we can get you like true local injections in the moment is that alright for now","3197":"okay okay any other questions","3198":"doctor: alright","3199":"hi , carolyn . how are you ?","3200":"i'm good . you're ready to get started ?","3201":"so carolyn is a 49-year-old female here for follow-up of her chronic problems . so , how are you doing , carolyn ?","3202":"okay , sure . and , are you right or left-handed ?","3203":"okay , and does one elbow bother you more than the other ?","3204":"okay . all right , and um , any other joint pain ?","3205":"okay , and any numbing or tingling in your hands ?","3206":"okay . all right , and i know that you've had this also , had this history of gout . and the last episode you had was about three months ago . you had some inflammation of your toe . have you had any other issues with that ?","3207":"okay . all right , and how are you doing with your psoriasis ?","3208":"okay . i- i know that we had given you some clobetasol for your scalp . is that- so that's doing okay ?","3209":"okay , great . um , all right , well , i'd like to go ahead and do a physical exam on you .","3210":"let's first look at your vital signs . hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . great , so everything looks good from that perspective . um , so looking at you , i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy . your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm , and your lungs sound really clear . on your right elbow , you do have some edema and inflammation of your right olecranon and there's some tenderness and an effusion right there . so um , does that hurt when i press it ?","3211":"okay , and when i turn your arm , do you have pain ?","3212":"okay , so she has pain- to palpation of the olecranon bursa and pain with pronation and supination . and when you flex- and when you bend it and straighten it , does that hurt ?","3213":"okay , so pain with flexion and extension of the right arm . uh , your abdomen is nice and soft , and there's no lower extremity edema . uh , let's go ahead and take a look at some of your labs . you know , you have a lot of arthritis for someone so young , so we had sent off that autoimmune panel . hey , dragon . show me the autoimmune labs . hey , dragon . show me the autoimmune profile . hey , dragon . show me the esr . okay , so that's good . hey , dragon . show me the uric acid . okay . all right , well , good . that's great . so , you know , it does n't look like you have any systemic arthritis , or sys- systemic inflammatory in process going on . so , my impression of you at this time is that from a gout standpoint , everything is nice and stable . i think that we should continue you on the colchicine 0.6 milligrams twice a day as needed for flare-ups of your gout . um , and then for your osteoarthritis , i'd like to go ahead and order a right elbow x-ray . hey , dragon . order a right elbow x-ray , and then i'd like to prescribe some meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day for the pain and the swelling .","3214":"hey , dragon . order meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day . and then i'd like to um , just see those- how- the x-ray show- shows up and the results of that before we refer you for any type of physical therapy , okay ?","3215":"and then from a psoriasis standpoint , i think everything is stable . we'll continue you on the steroid cream for your scalp , okay ?","3216":"all right , do you have any questions ?","3217":"all right , take care .","3218":"doctor: hey , dragon . finalize the note .","3219":"good afternoon , beverly . good to see you .","3220":"so , i know my nurse told you a little bit about dax . um , now , if you do n't mind , i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you .","3221":"great . um , beverly's a 24 year old female patient , and i know you have a history of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure . correct ?","3222":"okay . so , you're here today for your yearly exam . have n't seen you in a year . how're you doing ?","3223":"okay , so , that brings me to your diabetes . so , how have your blood sugars been ?","3224":"pretty bad lately ?","3225":"okay . and , that's really the only thing that's different is your diet , pretty much ?","3226":"and , that's because of the new job and all that ?","3227":"it's hard to ignore those desserts , are n't they ?","3228":"no willpower like me ?","3229":"okay . all right . and , and then , um , i know you've had high blood pressure , hypertension . how is , how have your blood sugars been ? have you been checking them ?","3230":"okay , so , your blood pressures have been normal . you've been sleeping well ?","3231":"no concerns about hurting yourself or anything like that ?","3232":"okay , good . okay , and i know my , um , nurse did a review of systems . other than what we've talked about so far , is there anything else that you needed to add ?","3233":"good . so , pretty much status quo except for those things that we've been working on , right ?","3234":"okay , good . all right . well , let me do a quick physical exam , okay ?","3235":"okay , squeeze my finger here . good . can you feel me touch out here ?","3236":"okay . and , can you feel me touch you down here ?","3237":"okay . no swelling . push your leg out . good . pull it back . mm-hmm . go . good . okay . so , on my exam , um , essentially , your exam is normal . your , um , heart is regular . you do have that grade 2 , um , systolic ejection fraction back ejection murmur that you , um , that we've heard in the past . okay ? so , um , we definitely know that's there . that's unchanged , okay ? um , your lungs are clear . um , your grips are equal . neurovascular's intact . you do n't have any carotid bruits in your neck , no thyromegaly . no edema . um , pulses are good , so essentially , your exam is , is essentially normal . let's take a look at some of your lab work , okay ?","3238":"hey , dragon , show me the hemoglobin a1c . okay , so , blood sugars have been elevated . your hemoglobin a1c is elevated as well , so that tells me your blood sugars have been a little bit out of control . you're still taking the metformin , correct ?","3239":"okay , and you take that twice a day ?","3240":"okay . um , uh , hey , dragon ? show me the vital signs . okay , good news here is your blood pressure's good . everything , um , there is fine . so , um , so , my assessment is , is , um , your first problem is diabetes . it's a little out of control . we'd like that hemoglobin a1c to be under seven , um , at least . you know , preferably , under six .","3241":"so , um , uh , i'm not gon na change your medication . i think this is diet related , so i want you to try to cut down on the snacking and additional sweets , okay ?","3242":"and , i want you to check your blood sugars in the morning . i want you to call them in in about two weeks so we know what your first , um , fasting blood sugar was in the morning , and then , we'll come back and see you in about two months and see if everything has straightened out . if it has n't , then we'll talk about adding another medication , okay ?","3243":"your second problem is your hypertension . that seems to be relatively stable . i want you to stay on your current medication . you're on li- lisinopril 10 mg once a day . just stay right on that medication . no changes at this point . seems to be doing well , okay ?","3244":"good . anything else i can do for you today ?","3245":"good . come with me , we'll get you checked out .","3246":"doctor: hey , dragon ? finalize the note .","3247":"hi , anna , how are you ?","3248":"i'm doing well . uh , so i know the nurse told you a little bit about dax . i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you .","3249":"all right . so , uh , anna is a 26-year-old female with a past medical history , significant for epilepsy , depression , and , uh , peptic ulcer disease , who presents with , uh , some joint pain . so , anna , what's going on with your , uh , what's going on with your joints ?","3250":"okay . have you noticed any swelling there on the-","3251":"okay , and is it right here on the , on the tip ?","3252":"okay , and are you right or left-handed ?","3253":"okay , so it's your non-dominant hand ?","3254":"okay , and any numbing or tingling in your hands at all ?","3255":"and any weakness in your arm ?","3256":"okay , and ... and how about .. and how about , um , any fever or chills ?","3257":"okay . all right , well , let's talk a little bit about your epilepsy , okay ?","3258":"um , have you had any recent seizures ?","3259":"okay , good .","3260":"and you're still taking the keppra ?","3261":"okay , great . and then , tell me a little about your depression . how're you doing with that ? i know that you went into therapy last year , and you tried to avoid medication since you're already on the keppra . how's that doing ?","3262":"okay . all right , but no , no feelings of wanting to hurt yourself or somebody else ?","3263":"okay . all right . and then , how are you doing with your , with your ulcer ? i know that you , you know , you had so much stress a year ago and , you know , you were having some issues there . we did the endoscopy-","3264":". and they showed that . so , how are you doing with that ?","3265":"okay , well great . let's go ahead and ... i'm gon na go ahead with , um ... and , you know , i know that the nurse did a review of systems sheet on you when you came in , and i know that you were endorsing that left elbow pain .","3266":"any other symptoms , you know , chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting ?","3267":"okay , so you're endorsing some nasal congestion ?","3268":"okay . all right , well , let's go ahead to a physical exam , okay ?","3269":"hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . good , here in the office , everything looks great with your vital signs . i think that's great , so i'm just gon na take a listen to your heart and your lungs , and take a look at your elbow and , and we'll go from there , okay ?","3270":"all right , so , so on physical examination of your left elbow , you do have some erythema and edema of your left elbow . does it hurt when i touch ?","3271":"okay , he ... she has some pain to palpation of the olecranon . of the left olecra- olecranon , and it is warm to palpation . um , can you straighten your elbow for me ?","3272":"okay , so she has pain with flexion and extension of the left elbow . there's a palpable right ... or s- ... palpable left radial pulse . okay , um , so let's go over ... i just wan na take a look at some of your results , okay ?","3273":"hey , dragon , show me the left elbow x-ray . hey , dragon , show me the elbow x-ray . hey , dragon , show me the left arm x-ray . okay , so , in reviewing the results of your left arm x-ray , there's no evidence of any elbow fracture , which is not surprising , okay ? hey , dragon , show me the endoscopy results . hey , dragon , show me the endoscopy . okay , well , your recent endoscopy showed that you ... hey , dragon , show me the endoscope . all right , so here it looks like , you know ... your endoscopy results look like you had an episode of gastritis . that's for your , your peptic ulcer disease , and so everything , you know ... you took your , your protonix , and i think everything resolved at that point , okay .","3274":"so , let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you . so for your first problem , this left elbow pain , you know , i think you have olecranon bursitis , and we're just gon na , you know , have you , you know , get a little pillow for your elbow there . it's just caused by repetitive trauma .","3275":"so , maybe you're slamming your elbow down a little bit on the desk , so just get a little rest there-","3276":". and we'll give you some melo- meloxicam , 15 mg , once a day . you can ice the area , okay ? um , for your next problem , the epilepsy , sounds like you're doing really well . i would go ahead and continue with the keppra , 500 mg , twice a day . do you need a refill of that ?","3277":"hey , dragon , order a refill of keppra , 500 mg , twice daily . for your third problem , the depression , it sounds like you're doing well with the therapy and , if you want , we can talk about medical treatment options .","3278":"okay , well , let's go ahead and we'll start you on some lexapro , 10 mg , once a day , and we'll see how you do on that , okay ?","3279":"all right , and then , for your last problem , the peptic ulcer disease , um , i want you to continue on the protonix , 40 mg , once a day before meals , okay ?","3280":"do you have any questions ?","3281":"okay . all right . well , the nurse will come in soon and see you , okay , and i'll , i'll see you in a couple of weeks .","3282":"all right , take care . bye .","3283":"doctor: hey , dragon , finalize the note .","3284":"hi , susan , how are you ?","3285":"good . are you ready to get started ?","3286":"so , susan is a 26-year-old female here for a high blood pressure check . susan , what's going on with your blood pressure ?","3287":"okay . so , i know that we've had you on the norvasc and we had to increase your dose , so you're on 10 milligrams a day now . and what are your blood pressures running at home ? you c- ... like , have they been like over 150 ?","3288":"okay . all right . and , have you had any headaches ?","3289":"okay . all right . so , you've had some headaches . have you had any chest pain , shortness of breath , anything like that ?","3290":"okay . um , and , you know , i know that you've had a kidney transplant a few years ago .","3291":"everything is okay with that ?","3292":"and you're taking all of your auto , um , i- um , your immunosuppression medications ?","3293":"all right . so , let's go ahead and we'll do a quick physical exam . so , looking at you , you do n't appear any distress . your neck is nice and supple . your heart is irregular rate and rhythm . i do hear a slight , uh , two out of six systolic ejection murmur . your lungs are clear . i do see the scar on the left , uh , left plank for your kidney transplant which is healed . and you have no lower extremity edema . so , let's go ahead and look at some of your results , okay ?","3294":"hey , dragon , show me the creatinine . so , your kidney function looks really good . so , that's really promising after your transplant . hey , dragon , show me the ekg . and your ekg looks great , uh , perfectly normal , so that's good . um , so , my impression of you at this time ... , let me see your blood pressure .","3295":"hey , dragon , show me the blood pressure . yeah , and you're right , it-","3296":". it is high . so , there is something that we can do for that . so , let's go ahead and we'll put you on ... so , my impression of you is that your , your blood pressure is high and the norvasc is n't controlling it . and , you know , we can definitely get it under better control . so , what i would like to do is prescribe you coreg 25 milligrams , twice a day . and that will help bring your blood pressure down , okay ?","3297":"hey , dragon , order carvedilol 25 milligrams , twice a day . uh , i'd also like to go ahead and , uh , get a lipid panel and some routine labs on you just to make sure that everything is okay .","3298":"hey , dragon , order a lipid panel . hey , dragon , order a complete metabolic panel . all right . and then , um , from a transplant standpoint , everything looks fine . your kidney function looks great , so we're just gon na continue you on all of those medications .so , the nurse will come in soon and she'll help you schedule all of the al- schedule a follow-up appointment with me , and we'll see what your blood pressure looks like in a couple weeks after taking that medication . okay ?","3299":"all right . thanks , susan .","3300":"doctor: hey , dragon , finalize the note .","3301":"hello mrs. lee , i see you're here for back pain .","3302":"hey dragon , i'm seeing mrs. lee today for , uh , back pain . she's a 40-year-old female . so can you tell me what happened to you ?","3303":"so it was a surprise for you too ?","3304":"very good . okay . so , um , did it hurt because you hit it , or did you twist ? what happened when you ?","3305":"okay . any pain shooting down your legs at all ?","3306":"is it on one side or the other of your back ?","3307":"on the right . is there anything that makes it better or worse ?","3308":"okay . all right . and do you have any history or any back problems before ?","3309":"okay , yeah that lumbar fusion . um , let's take an x-ray . hey . or let's look at an x-ray . hey dragon , show me the latest x-ray . okay , we can see where you had your fusion , t4 here on the x-ray . but i do n't see anything that looks , um , significantly abnormal . it does n't appear to have any compression fractures or anything like that . so , it's essentially , except for the fusion , a normal exam . let me do your exam for you here . can i have you stand up please ? does it hurt when i twist you that way ?","3310":"okay . you can sit back down . if i lift your leg here , does that bother you ?","3311":"how 'bout when i lift this leg ?","3312":"any pain shooting down your legs when i do that ?","3313":"okay . and can you feel me touching down here .","3314":"okay , great . so , you had a injury to your back when you were twisting at the birthday party . you do n't really have any pain or numbness down your legs . you have some stiffness with rotation , um , but you do n't have any evidence of a , um , what we would call a pinched nerved or radiculopathy . so , i think you basically have a strain of your lower back . um , have you been taking any medications ?","3315":"okay . and do you have any other , um , medical problems ?","3316":"okay . and that's all ? okay . um , so what we're gon na do is i'm gon na give you , um , just continue the motrin at 800mg , three times a day , with food . i want you to use some ice and heat , alternating on your back . but i do want you walking .","3317":"um , and , uh , this should sort of take care of itself after a few days . if it's not , or it's getting worse , i want you to come back and see me over the next week .","3318":"does that sound good ?","3319":"okay , dragon . hey dragon , go ahead and order the medications and procedures and close out the note . come on i'll bring you out to check out .","3320":"good morning rebecca , nice to see you .","3321":"so , my nurse told you a little bit about dax , now i'm wondering if i can tell dax a little bit about you .","3322":"okay , so rebecca is a 27-year-old female patient . um , you have a history of carpal tunnel , um , uh , release done couple of years ago , you have some chronic back pain , some depression . why am i seeing you today ?","3323":"just in your right knee ?","3324":"okay . just when swimming ? are you swimming freestyle with your legs kicking straight or more like breaststroke where your legs kick out ?","3325":"and no injury ? like you did n't fall or twist it or anything like that that you remember ?","3326":"okay . so just swimming a lot and you feeling more and more discomfort ?","3327":"okay , good . so , um ... i know my nurse did a review of systems before you came in . there were really no significant issues . you have a history of chronic back pain , that's been doing well ?","3328":"okay , no pain going down your legs or anything like that ?","3329":"okay . and i know you have some depression , you've been on medication . how's that been going ?","3330":"sleeping well ?","3331":"eating well ? okay . do n't feel any concerns about hurting yourself or others or anything like that ?","3332":"okay , good . um , and the , you had ca- carpal tunnel done a few years ago . how's that doing ?","3333":"any flare up with that ?","3334":"okay , great . do you mind if i do a quick exam ?","3335":"squeeze my fingers for me . good . okay . is it painful if i move your patella like that ?","3336":"okay . and i'm gon na hold your leg out , i'm gon na hold , i want you to stiffen your upper ... does that hurt when i do that ?","3337":"okay , good , all right . um , let's take a quick look at your x-ray , okay ?","3338":"hey dragon , show me the right knee x-ray . okay , so here's a picture of your right knee . actually normal x-ray , everything looks good , okay ? on my exam , um , you do n't really have any swelling in- in your joints , um , uh , of your knee . you have a little pain with , um , uh , range of motion of the knee . you have real pain when we do what we call patella in- ... patellar inhibition , okay ? so that's what caused most of that pain . so , um , your heart is regular , your lungs are clear , i do n't feel any adenopathy , your thyroid's , um , normal , your grips are equal , the rest of your exam is essentially normal , okay ? so my assessment is , you have what we call chondromalacia of the patella , okay ? it's just from the overuse and all- all the swimming you've been doing , okay ? so , um , to treat that we'll just use some anti-inflammatories , um , go ahead and take some ibuprofen , 600 milligrams four times a day with food . i do want you to do some straight leg raising exercises , that'll strengthen your quadriceps and that'll help with that pain , okay ?","3339":"um , basically you want to avoid anything that puts extra pressure on your knees for a little while and it should be fine . if it's not getting any better in a couple weeks i wan na see you again , okay ? so no lunges , avoid the breaststroke . if you're comfortable, you can also do other swimming strokes where your knees are straight instead . or you can take the opportunity to have a little break .","3340":"your second problem is your chronic back pain , that's been doing really well . um , keep swimming , that's okay after this gets better .","3341":"um , but i think , um , i think that's been under control . but if it flares up go ahead and , uh , give me a call , okay ?","3342":"um , your third problem is your depression . that's been stable . we're gon na keep you on your current medication , not gon na change anything at this point , okay ? and as far as your carpal tunnel goes , that's relatively stable , so , um , uh , no changes there as well . okay ? so anything else i can do for you ?","3343":"okay , well we'll get you checked out .","3344":"doctor: hey dragon , finalize the report .","3345":"we're gon na go right to the front- . so when you touch that- hi , michelle , how are you ?","3346":"i'm good . so i know the nurse told you about dax . i'd like to dax a little bit about you , okay ?","3347":"all right . so , michelle is a 31-year-old female with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension who presents with abnormal lab finding . so , michelle , it came back to me that you had had a positive long ... lyme titer .","3348":"and so , uh , can you , you , you know , can you tell me a little bit about it ? i know the last time i saw you , you had had an insect bite , and you know , it came back positive for lyme . so how are you feeling ?","3349":"okay . all right . and have you had any , any body aches ?","3350":"okay . all right . um , and i know that you were out hiking in the woods and , and that type of thing a couple of weeks ago , and we thought that that's where you got the bite . so , um , how's your , how's your appetite ? have you been okay ? a little nauseous ?","3351":"okay , and , and i know that you had had that , that , uh , bite there . have you noticed any other rash anywhere else ?","3352":"okay . all right . sometimes they kind of describe it as looking as like a bull's-eye .","3353":"is that what it looked like ?","3354":"okay . all right . well , um , have you had any , any high fevers ?","3355":"all right . um , and how about from a diabetes standpoint ? how ... how's your blood sugar been running ? especially now that you kind of have this , like , acute thing going on ? have your blood sugars been okay ?","3356":"okay . all right . um , and you're still taking the metformin ?","3357":"okay . all right . good . and then in terms of your high blood pressure , are you monitoring the blood pressures at home ?","3358":"mm-hmm .","3359":"okay . and , um , so you're still taking the lisinopril ?","3360":"okay , great . all right , well , you know , i know that you did the review of systems sheet when you checked in , and i know that you're endorsing some nausea and some joint pain and some body aches . any other symptoms ? abdominal pain ? diarrhea ? anything like that ?","3361":"okay . um , so let's go ahead , and we'll ... i'm gon na do a quick physical exam .","3362":"hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . so i'm looking here at your vital signs . they look great . you do n't have a fever at that ... at this time , so that's really encouraging . i'm just gon na check you out , and , uh , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs and look for any rashes and let you know what i find , okay ?","3363":"okay , so on physical examination , you know , you do have some swelling of your , uh , elbow joints bilaterally . um , does it hurt when i touch them ?","3364":"okay , so she has pain to palpation to both elbow joints . um , and on your skin examination , you do have a bull's-eye rash on your , um , abdomen on the left-hand side . um , it's , it's warm to palpation . any pain with that ?","3365":"non-tender to palpation , no evidence of cellulitis . um , and the rest of , you know , the rest of your exam is pretty normal , okay ? so let me just go over some of the results with you , okay ?","3366":"hey , dragon , show me the lyme titer . so you can see here , you know , in reviewing the results of your lyme titer , it is elevated . so we're gon na go ahead and do some further testing , but we're gon na , you know , we're gon na look into that , okay ?","3367":"hey , dragon , show me the labs . and in reviewing the results of your labs , everything else looks good . so again , you know , you do n't have an elevated white blood cell count or anything like that . so i think we got this early enough , and we can go ahead and , and treat it , okay ?","3368":"so i wan na talk a little bit about , you know , my assessment and my plan for you . so for your first problem , this newly diagnosed lyme disease , i wan na go ahead and prescribe you doxycycline , 100 milligrams twice a day . you have to take it for three weeks , okay ?","3369":"i'm gon na just touch base with an infectious disease doctor to make sure that there's not anything else that we need to do , okay ? and i wan na see you again next week for a follow-up for this , okay ?","3370":"so for your second problem , your type 2 diabetes , i wan na go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and just this ... make sure we do n't have to make any changes to the metformin , okay ?","3371":"hey , dragon , order a hemoglobin a1c . and for your last problem , your high blood pressure . it looks today like everything is fine . i think you're doing a really good job of managing your hypertension , and i'm going to continue you on the lisinopril , 10 milligrams a day , and i'm gon na go ahead and order a lipid panel , and , um , i want you to continue to record your blood , blood pressure regularly , okay ?","3372":"all right . do you need a refill of that ?","3373":"okay . hey , dragon , order lisinopril , 10 milligrams daily . do you have any questions ?","3374":"okay , so i'm gon na , you know , the nurse is gon na come in , and she's gon na check you out , and then we'll make a follow-up appointment for you , okay ?","3375":"doctor: hey , dragon , finalize the note .","3376":"hi , hannah . how are you ?","3377":"i'm good . you ready to get started ?","3378":"so , hannah is a , uh , 52-year-old female here for evaluation of a high blood sugar . so , hannah , what ha- what happened ? i heard you were in the emergency room with a high blood sugar .","3379":"okay . all right . and how , how are you feeling now ? did they , did , did they treat you in the emergency room ? did they gi- they give you some iv fluids and things like that ?","3380":"okay . and i saw you went through a review of systems sheet with a nurse . i just want to ask you a few more questions from that standpoint . so you have had any fever or chills ?","3381":"any chest pain or shortness of breath ?","3382":"abdominal pain ?","3383":"any burning when you urinate ?","3384":"any joint pain or muscle aches ?","3385":"perfect . um , and then , i know that you have this history of a-fib , atrial fibrillation . have you felt your heart racing at all , recently ?","3386":"okay . all right . and how are you doing with your reflux ?","3387":"okay , yeah . i see here you're on the protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day .","3388":"so that's , you're doing well with that ?","3389":"okay . all right . so let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam . so , listening to you , um , look , or looking at you , you appear in no distress . your thyroid is a little enlarged , but non-tender . there's no carotid bruits , your heart is in irregular rate and rhythm , and your lungs are clear . your abdomen is nice and soft , and you have no edema in your lower extremities . let's go ahead and look at some of your test results .","3390":"hey , dragon ? show me the blood sugar . hey , dragon ? show me the blood glucose . hey , dragon ? show me the hemoglobin a1c . okay , so i see here that both your blood sugar and your hemoglobin a1c are elevated . so your blood sugars have probably been running high for probably a few months . okay ? um , let's go ahead and look at some of your other results . hey , dragon ? show me the diabetes labs . yeah . okay . yeah , so , um , my impression of you at this time , um , for your high blood sugars , that you do have this diagnosis of diabetes . now , we're not sure if it's type i or type ii . even patients in , you know , in their mid-twenties can develop type i diabetes , so we're gon na go off and , we're gon na go ahead and , and send some labs to work that up . hey , dragon ? order a complete metabolic panel . and i'd like to start you on metformin , 500 milligrams , twice a day . that will help keep your blood sugars down .","3391":"hey , dragon ? order metformin , 500 milligrams , twice a day . and then if some of the autoimmune labs that come back show that you have an autoimmune disorder , meaning that you would have type i diabetes , then we would have to go ahead and put you on insulin . but i'm gon na hold off until we have those results , okay ?","3392":"but in the meantime , i really want you to avoid , uh , foods high in sugar . um , and the , the nurse will come in and she'll give you a glucometer and teach you how to do blood sugar testing . okay ?","3393":"and then , from an atrial fibrillation standpoint , your heart , even though you're in atrial fibrillation right now , is in a good rate . and we'll just continue you on your metoprolol , 25 milligrams , twice a day . do you need a refill on that ?","3394":"hey , dragon ? order a refill on metoprolol , 25 milligrams , twice a day . and for your reflux , we'll just continue you on the protonix , okay ?","3395":"do you have any questions , hannah ?","3396":"okay , so the nurse will come in and she'll go over all that stuff with you .","3397":"take care .","3398":"doctor: hey , dragon ? finalize the note .","3399":"hi janet , how are you ?","3400":"i'm good . uh , are you ready to get started ?","3401":"okay . so , janet is a 33-year-old female , here for some , some joint paint . what , what joint's been bothering you , janet ?","3402":"mm-hmm .","3403":"okay . all right . and is it one knee versus the other ? or both equally ?","3404":"okay . and have you been having any other joint pain like , elbows or shoulder , or anything like that ?","3405":"mm-hmm .","3406":"okay , and what shoulder was that ?","3407":"okay , all right . and , um , any pins and needles in your feet at all ? any swelling in your legs ?","3408":"okay , and your blood sugars have been under control ?","3409":"okay . and have you had any fever or chills ?","3410":"okay . any nausea or vomiting , chest pains , shortness of breath ?","3411":"okay . all right . so , yeah , i see on here that you do take norvasc , five mg a day and you've been taking that every day-","3412":"okay . um , and , um , so let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you . so , hey dragon , show me the blood pressure . your blood pressure's actually pretty high today , so you might be a little nervous here , which is not uncommon .","3413":"um , so , looking at you , your , your neck is nice and soft , there's no enlarged thyroid . your heart has a regular rate and rhythm . your lungs are clear . your abdomen is nice and soft , but looking at your knees , on your left knee you do have a slight erythema and edema . there is a small efusion present over your left knee . um , you have some decrease flexion and extension of your knee , but your strength in your lower extremities is good . uh , so let's go ahead and look at some of your results . i know that we did some x-rays when you came in .","3414":"hey dragon , show me the left knee x-ray . okay , so looking at this , this is an , this is a normal x-ray of your left knee , so you may just have a little bit of a strain going on in your , in your knees there .","3415":"uh , let's look at some of your labs , 'cause i know that you have the diabetes . hey dragon , show me the labs . so , here your white blood cell count is not elevated , so i'm not concerned about an infection or anything like that . um , hey dragon , show me the diabetes' labs . okay and , and your a1c is a little elevated , but it's not , it's not terrible , so i think for right now we'll just continue you on the current regimen . um , so my plan from you , for you in terms of the joint pain , um , i'd like to go ahead and , you know , we'll just send some autoimmune labs to work , work up your left knee pain and , uh , we'll work for you to do some physical therapy and i'd like to go ahead and give you anti-inflammatory medication to help with the pain . does that sound okay ?","3416":"okay . hey dragon , order meloxicam 15 mg once a day . hey dragon , order a physical therapy referral . hey dragon , order an autoimmune profile . and then from a hypertension standpoint you , because your blood pressure is a little elevated today , i'd like you to continue to monitor it at home and , you know , send me a report in the next couple of weeks sh- , you know , giving me the , the blood pressure reportings . do you have a blood pressure cuff at home ?","3417":"okay . and then , um , we'll go ahead and order a lipid profile for you . hey dragon , order a lipid profile . and then for , from a diabetes standpoint let's go ahead and , uh , continue you on your metformin 500 mg twice a day . okay ?","3418":"do you have any questions ?","3419":"okay . the nurse will be in soon . it was good to see you .","3420":"doctor: hey dragon , finalize the note .","3421":"morning christine , nice to see you .","3422":"so i know my nurse told you a little bit of- ... um , about dax and i'm gon na tell dax a little bit about you , if that's okay ?","3423":"okay , great . um , uh , this is christine . she's a 63-year-old female patient . you're here for your routine , um , yearly exam . um , i know you have a history of high blood pressure and you've had some depression in the past . and i also know you did have a carpal tunnel release done about two years ago . um , how have you been doing ?","3424":"okay . and you're sleeping well at night ? and everything's been going well from that standpoint ?","3425":"okay . and no thoughts of hurting yourself or anything like that ?","3426":"okay , good . um , and , um , i- i know you've had some high blood pressure in the past . have you been checking your blood pressure ?","3427":"has n't really stayed put ?","3428":"okay . and , um , you've been talking your medication though , right ?","3429":"and have you had any headaches or swelling or anything like that that's been abnormal ?","3430":"okay , well , that's fair .","3431":"okay good . and , um ... i know my nurse did a review of systems . other than what we've just talked about , has there been anything else that you wanted to add to that ?","3432":"great , great . no numbness or tingling in your hands ?","3433":"fingers ? okay , good . all right , well , um , lem me do a quick exam if that's okay ?","3434":"deep breath . squeeze my fingers for me . feel me touch you here ?","3435":"can you touch down here ?","3436":"can you push your leg out ? push this one up . pull it back . yeah , good . okay . so on my exam , um ... your exam's essentially normal , your lungs are clear , are- ... you do n't have any adenopathy in your neck , you do n't have any , um , uh , hyperthyroidism . um , your heart is regular without any murmurs . um , your grips are equal , neurologically intact , strength is good , pulses are good . so overall , um , your exam is fine . let's take a- a look at some of your labs and vital signs .","3437":"hey dragon , show me the blood pressure . okay , so here in the office today it is a little bit elevated , okay ? so your blood pressure is a little bit high . so the results , um , do show that . um , hey dragon , show me the labs . okay , so good news is is your- your labs are all essentially normal , so the results of your labs are essentially normal , okay ? so ... um , my assessment is that your- ... you do have hypertension still . um , and i think we need to increase your blood pressure medicine a little bit , okay ? so i'm gon na increase your lisinopril to 10 milligrams a day , just once a day , um , but i'm gon na increase that a little bit , okay ? and then want you to check it and i'm gon na have you come back in a month and we'll see how you're doing with regards to that , okay ?","3438":"um , your second problem is your dep- depression , you're doing great , i do n't wan na change anything at this point . let's just stay- ... we'll change one thing with your high blood pressure-","3439":"so i do n't wan na change any other medications at this point in time , so let's just leave that as it is .","3440":"and then your third problem was your carpal tunnel . that seems to be doing well . if you notice any tingling or any changes or you get some of those symptoms back , just let me know . okay ?","3441":"all right . anything else i can do for you today ?","3442":"okay . great . uh , lem me get you checked out .","3443":"doctor: hey dragon , finalize the report .","3444":"next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation . hi emily , how are you ?","3445":"i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ?","3446":"okay , and that's the 250\/50 dose , correct ?","3447":"perfect . so how does that compare ?","3448":"and that's one puff twice a day ?","3449":"okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ?","3450":"so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity .","3451":"okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ?","3452":"no kidding , that's great .","3453":"really ?","3454":"and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ?","3455":"and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ?","3456":"okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ?","3457":"okay , and do you think that's working okay ?","3458":"great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ?","3459":"okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then .","3460":"okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ?","3461":"now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ?","3462":"okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ?","3463":"do you use it more just as needed in the summer ?","3464":"okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ?","3465":"and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ?","3466":"wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ?","3467":"okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ?","3468":"super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it .","3469":"okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ?","3470":"okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year .","3471":"and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ?","3472":"okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards .","3473":"and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment .","3474":"it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape .","3475":"yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point .","3476":"well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .","3477":"all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh .","3478":"good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on .","3479":"and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good .","3480":"so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ?","3481":"yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?","3482":"okay . most insurances do limit what we can use .","3483":"okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med .","3484":"so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much .","3485":"that we had too much , yeah .","3486":"um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco .","3487":"okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day .","3488":"okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .","3489":"and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests .","3490":"is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ?","3491":"okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well .","3492":"you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ?","3493":"okay got it . and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ?","3494":"okay good . well i think we have our game plan .","3495":"and do the alvesco two puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it . the zyrtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen .","3496":"all right so we've got it .","3497":"all right i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say four months re-check for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer- spirometry at that time .","3498":"all right well thanks so much and you have a great day .","3499":"doctor: and we'll do a follow-up in four months with act and spirometry , sooner if needed . follow-up 25 minutes .","3500":"all right , new patient , jordan roberts . date of birth : 3\/2\/1972 . he's a 49 year old , uh hm , with hypertension and palpitations . please copy forward his thyroid profile from march 1st , 2021 . hello mr. roberts , how are you doing today ?","3501":"good . good . so , i saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations .","3502":"yeah . have you , uh , have you felt it again since ?","3503":"okay . uh , so tell me about the blood pressure then .","3504":"do you have a family history of this ?","3505":"uh , can you tell me which medications you're taking ?","3506":"okay . um . yes , i see that in your chart . the benicar hct . it has hydrochlorothiazide in it .","3507":"okay . are you still taking the amlodipine , 10 milligrams daily ?","3508":"that's- that's a good start on a regimen . are you checking your blood pressure at home , and if yes , what numbers are you seeing ?","3509":"awesome .","3510":"so you're not down in the 120s yet ?","3511":"okay . uh , how are you doing with your salt intake ?","3512":"good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure .","3513":"are you doing any exercise ?","3514":"okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look .","3515":"uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented .","3516":"so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good .","3517":"your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great .","3518":"all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts .","3519":"all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling .","3520":"all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ?","3521":"okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone .","3522":"um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try .","3523":"okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room .","3524":"yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay .","3525":"uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon .","3526":"okay . uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better . um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged . um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure .","3527":"yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure .","3528":"um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise . um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure .","3529":"yeah , yeah . it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium . um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that . um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information . um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff .","3530":"all right . so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes . uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic .","3531":"all right . so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension . they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up . when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure .","3532":"yeah . so , that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points . um , there are of course some risks , so not everyone is a candidate . uh , but we'll cross that road , uh , when we need to , and let's just- let's just see how you do with the addition of the medication .","3533":"all right . so , we will see you in two weeks then .","3534":"yeah , you're welcome . let me know if you have any questions .","3535":"all right . have a great day mr. roberts .","3536":"doctor: mr. roberts presents with resistant hypertension . he's on three meds and maximum dose . i have added spironolactone to his regiment . we will need to monitor his potassium and sodium . he will have a metabolic panel and blood pressure check in two weeks . uh , next medication would be carvedilol , uh , which i try to avoid giving , it's potential for erectile dysfunction . i have talked to the patient about that , and the potential side effects of spironolactone , including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances . if he is not controlled on spironolactone , the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic .","3537":"brittany edwards , 07 , 1898 . she is a return visit for ibs with functional abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting . ms. edwards is a pleasant , 32-year-old female who was last seen in august of 2019 with flares of abdominal pain , who was diagnosed with irritable bowl that was treated with bentyl . she had a previous prescription for reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea . she was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement , such as citrucel , daily , probiotics to help with gas and bloating , bentyl up to four times daily for intestinal cramping , and stop reglan and use zofran as needed . neuromodulators such as elavil and buspar were discussed but not started . hello , how are you ?","3538":"good . how have you been feeling ?","3539":"yeah , so my nurse told me you have been going out to eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp .","3540":"okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that .","3541":"yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol . and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps , or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea .","3542":"okay . um , so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ?","3543":"okay . and are they soft stools or formed stools ?","3544":"okay . and after you have gone out either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ?","3545":"okay . do you feel it's the food or the alcohol or both ?","3546":"okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce .","3547":"okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ?","3548":"okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ?","3549":"um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ?","3550":"okay . and how is it during the week ?","3551":"yeah , and with the diarrhea and abdomal- um , abdominal pain .","3552":"and was everything all right after that ?","3553":"okay . remember , it's also the portion sizes . so i mean , if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay . you have to just really watch the portions .","3554":"sounds good . all right , well let's take a look at you today , and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions , and we will discuss once we have finished the exam .","3555":"all right . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . all right . i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . all right , so if you could just lay back for me , and i'll examine your abdomen .","3556":"all right . do you have any tenderness ?","3557":"okay . so the abdomen is soft , non-tender . no masses or organomegaly . and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . all right . you can go ahead and sit up now . thank you . all right , so first i want you to try citrucel . it does come in a tablet . you should use it twice daily for regularity . then i would say , if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 milligrams . you can do one tablet before you eat , and then repeat up to four times daily . and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything . um , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later , and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine .","3558":"okay . and so your bentyl , that's the anti-spasm medication , and i would take the higher dose .","3559":"yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse .","3560":"okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water .","3561":"okay , and you can take it , but before you do , we want to try to reduce the triggers . uh , so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks .","3562":"okay . and so , however , if it is not just these isolated inci- incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long term medication that would take ... that you would take every night . and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ?","3563":"yeah , there is . and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ?","3564":"okay , great . we can definitely do that . uh , just take it every night before bedtime .","3565":"you're welcome . and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else . and then let's plan on touching base through mychart email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms . okay ?","3566":"doctor: you're welcome , and have a good rest of your day . so review of symptoms is positive for diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal pain . assessment and plan . brittany edwards is a pleasant female with ibs and functional abdominal pain , aggravated by high stress , poor eating habits , and poor sleeping habits . i've encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications , as well as starting a neuromodulator such as elavil 25 milligrams at bedtime for ibs . she can use bentyl 20 milligrams as needed 30 to 45 minutes prior to eating out at a restaurant . she can also use zofran if needed . however , i have encouraged her to reduce greasy and fatty foods and alcohol consumption . i have asked her to follow up in one month by emailing over mychart regarding any side effects and issues , or issues with elavil or if adjustments are needed .","3567":"okay , so our next patient is christopher watson . date of birth 04\/12\/1934 . mr . watson is- is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow-up for adult hydrocephalus . this is his first visit since undergoing sh- shunt surgery , excuse me , on august 1st , 2020 . i have followed mr . watson since may of 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control . we established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spino catheter protocol in june 2020 , and he underwent shunt surgery on august 1st , 2020 . a medtronic strata programmable shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at a level 2.0 was placed . good morning , mr . watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ?","3568":"mr . watson , have you been sick or been hosp -- hospitalized since your shu- shunt surgery three months ago .","3569":"good , i'm glad to hear that . before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control . are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ?","3570":"that's impressive , mr . watson .","3571":"no issues with sores from wearing the diaper ? and any decreased or painful urination ?","3572":"and how about cognition ?","3573":"that's so wonderful ! now have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ?","3574":"okay . and any pain in your belly at all ?","3575":"okay , sounds like you have been improving . alrighty , mr . watson , i'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me . is that all right ?","3576":"okay , i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month , and then we'll chat about it when i come in . all righty , mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . now , i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms , and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan .","3577":"just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved so that's all good for me . so really there's , there's nothing to worry about .","3578":"yep , that's right .","3579":"yeah , of course .","3580":"ah man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range . and that , that definitely could be you . you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that then , ya know , i think it could be possible , um , and i'd be happy to recommend it . now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation . so you could kind of do that preemptively , and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go .","3581":"yeah , your safety is our number one priority and , ya know , i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right , they want to keep you here and have you safe . but , i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved . and so , i'm sure when we talk again in three months , we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement .","3582":"yeah , that would be great . the girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now , and you both take care , all right ?","3583":"doctor: all righty , so ros is constitutional significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions . negative for fever or unintentional weight loss . gu is significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper . negative for genital sores , decreased or painful output . neurological significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment . negative for headaches , recent falls , or hallucinations . psychiatric is negative for depression , excessive worrying , or mood swings . let's go ahead and use the short pe . vitals , let's see , blood pressure is 124\/80 , heart rate 64 , respirations 18 , weight 174 pounds , and pain zero out of 10 . mr . watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who's able to converse easily through , um , though his daughter does add some details . the shunt sight was clean , dry , and intact with a confirmed setting of two . um he was tested um for recent and remote memory , attention span , and concentration in fund of knowledge . he scored a 26 out of 30 on the mmse when tested with spelling and 25 out of 30 when tested with calculations . of note , he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing , and the third with multiple choice . this was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23 out of 30 with calculations and 24 out of 30 with spelling . and at the time he was unable um in the previous test , excuse me , he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing without and only one with multiple choice . gait testing using the tinetti assessment tool . he was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of six to eight out of 12 and a balance score of 12 out of 16 for a total score of 18 to 20 out of 28 . this is slightly improved from his initial score of 15 to 17 out of 28 . cranial nerves , pupils are equal . eoms are intact . face symmetric . no disarchria . motor normal for bulk and strength . coordination slow from no- finger to nose . of note , the ct scan from the head of 10\/15\/2020 shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of monro of 4.6 centimeters with a third ventricular contour that is flat with a span of 10 millimeters . by my reading there is a tiny amount of blood in the right front region with a tiny subdermal collection . this was not noticed or noted by the radiologist who stated any extra axial fluid collections . there is also substantial small vessel ischemic change . diagnosis adult hydrocephalus , gait impairment , urinary incontinence and urgency , and cognitive impairment .","3584":"amanda taylor , birth date october 31st 1949 . patient is a 72 year old woman who comes for followup for hypertension . her history includes significant alcohol use disorder and mi- mild hypercholesterolemia . at last visit on april 16th her blood pressure was 130 over 90 . after presenting at 150 over 100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams by mouth once daily , and lisinopril 20 milligrams by mouth once daily . cmp and cbc were essentially unremarkable . hi miss taylor , how are you today ?","3585":"thanks for coming in today .","3586":"so how have things been going for you ?","3587":"okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?","3588":"okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?","3589":"yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?","3590":"how much had- how much had you been drinking ?","3591":"okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .","3592":"okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?","3593":"and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?","3594":"okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?","3595":"okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?","3596":"okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?","3597":"yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .","3598":"okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .","3599":"use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?","3600":"any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus ?","3601":"have you received your coronavirus vaccine ?","3602":"okay , great . all right well i'm just going to look at your ankles and feet , i'm looking for any signs of swelling .","3603":"all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .","3604":"so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .","3605":"it actually will help with both .","3606":"generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .","3607":"yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .","3608":"okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .","3609":"okay , yeah , maybe you have .","3610":"okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?","3611":"yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .","3612":"then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing .","3613":"all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose .","3614":"you are welcome , have a good rest of your day .","3615":"doctor: miss taylor is drinking alcohol four to five days per week to excess . no tobacco , no substance abuse , skin is moist

breathing , cardiac rhythm regular , no murmur , no gallop , jvp flat , with a head at 90 degrees . she does not appear anxious , agitated or depressed . my impression , alcohol use disorder . she would like to start naltrexone which we have previously discussed . she will take the injectable form and start on may 17th . we reviewed side effects and risks . the potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to her for many reasons . hypertension , she is taking lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams daily . quite possibly her blood pressure will improve completely with cessation of alcohol . her target bp is 130 to 140 over 70 to 80 . i will see her back week of june 14th , which is likely around the time of her second naltrexone injection . i recommend upgrading influenza vaccination and shingrix . number two , she did defer this .","3616":"next patient is grace ross . date of birth 8-23-97 . ms. ross is a new

.","3622":"yep . nah , that does sound like a cause for concern . how long have you been with him ?","3623":"mm-hmm .","3624":"uh- . um , okay . do you ... have you ever had an irregular pap smear ?","3625":"okay . and when was your last pap smear ?","3626":"okay . good , okay . well , let's see ... let's take a look at you , and then , we'll get some samples for std testing . okay ?","3627":"you'll hear me talk through your exam , so that i can get it all documented . uh- ? use my general physical exam template . pelvic exam demonstrates no external lesions . normal labia

feel some pressure , now . cervix is normal . vaginal wall is normal . no cervical motion tenderness and no adnexal tenderness or masses noted . swabs were done for std testing . okay , ms. ross . everything looks good from a visual standpoint . i'm going to send off std testing for , uh , gonorrhea , chlamydia , trichomoniasis , and i'll have you give some blood for syphilis , hiv and

right knee . hello mr. nelson , how are you ?","3630":"that was your right knee , correct ? i take it the injection did n't help ?","3631":"that's it ? and is it still painful ?","3632":"okay , what would you say your pain level is ?","3633":"okay , and its been swollen like that for how long now ?","3634":"okay , but before it was just the knee ?","3635":"okay , okay , so that has n't been working for you ?","3636":"hmm . has it been keeping you from doing things during the day ?","3637":"yeah , i can see , that makes sense . have you been taking your medication regularly ? your on xeljanz right ?","3638":"yes , the 200mgs daily . how's that working for you ?","3639":"okay , well come sit over here , and if you could take of your socks and shoes , and we'll take a look at your knee . and just to let you know , i have a service now that writes my note about the visit , so you'll hear me call things out and describe what i see fully .","3640":"right , so let's check your leg . can you straighten it , and does it hurt ?","3641":"okay , range of motion slightly diminished . i'm going to press here , okay ? and how about here , hmm , i see some pitting around the knee and ankle . normal capillary refill in the toes . does any of this area hurt ?","3642":"so , i can feel that the knee is hot , and that means there's something going on , like some inflammation . so we can give you another steroid injection for that . i also want to get an x-ray of that knee , so we can see where all the swelling is coming from .","3643":"okay , and did we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ?","3644":"okay . so i think we'll set that up for you now . we'll also do an x-ray on that knee . i can send you for a physical therapy , and if nothing is helping , then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee .","3645":"all right , so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot . i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection . there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless .","3646":"yep . once we're done talking here , and as far as the edema in your legs , uh , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can do as well . the compression socks are a good start . um , and also , do you eat a lot of salt ?","3647":"okay . well , salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling . you can also prop your feet up any time you get a chance , especially at night . and have you talked to your private care doctor about this at all ?","3648":"okay . so i think , try some of those things out first , and if it does n't help , definitely make an appointment with them , also , as you know , xeljanz is a high-risk medication , so we need to check your cmp levels every couple of months . so this time your levels are good , but do make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time .","3649":"doctor: yes , of course . well let me go ahead and get supplies and we'll get to work on your knee . fluid aspiration and steroid injection procedure . the risks , benefits , and alternatives were explained . the risks of steroid injection were explained , including , but not limited to : hypopigmentation , soft tissue atrophy , tendon ruptures , and transient hypoglycemia among others . verbal consent was attained . the right knee was , uh , um , accessed through the lateral approach with 3 milliliters of initially clear fluid , then bloo- blood tinged fluid . then the right knee was prepped in a standard-fashion . the right knee was injected with 80 milligrams of triamcinolone , and one milliliter of lidocaine . the procedure was tolerated well , with no complications . post-procedure instructions were given . patient will follow up with his pcp . thank you .","3650":"uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate . hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ?","3651":"good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .","3652":"good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?","3653":"okay , that sounds good .","3654":"i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?","3655":"okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .","3656":"okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .","3657":"okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .","3658":"yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?","3659":"so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?","3660":"okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?","3661":"okay . and you're using the metro cream ?","3662":"how often are you using that one ?","3663":"okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?","3664":"so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?","3665":"okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?","3666":"okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?","3667":"no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .","3668":"um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?","3669":"okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .","3670":"i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .","3671":"uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .","3672":"i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .","3673":"um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .","3674":"great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .","3675":"all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .","3676":"it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .","3677":"let's see .","3678":"ugh , yeah . that's way too much .","3679":"yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .","3680":"because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .","3681":"okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .","3682":"yeah , mm-hmm .","3683":"so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .","3684":"yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .","3685":"pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .","3686":"correct , it's not a steroid .","3687":"it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .","3688":"but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .","3689":"these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .","3690":"so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?","3691":"so i will say , \" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . \"","3692":"yes , and keep using the face wash.","3693":"i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?","3694":"i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .","3695":"i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .","3696":"so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .","3697":"and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .","3698":"all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .","3699":"if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?","3700":"but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .","3701":"all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .","3702":"once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .","3703":"and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .","3704":"i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?","3705":"do you have enough refills ?","3706":"okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .","3707":"all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .","3708":"okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .","3709":"yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .","3710":"okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .","3711":"doctor: for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .","3712":"hey good morning bobby how are you","3713":"alright well i'm i'm sorry to hear that you're having pain but i i'm glad that he sent you over to see me i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain can you describe the kind of pain that you feel","3714":"okay and then when you get that pain can you rate that pain for me on a scale like zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life","3715":"okay alright and then time wise are we looking at can it just come and go anytime or is it specifically around mealtimes how how does that pain kinda wax and wane for you","3716":"do n't weigh all so speaking of eating let's talk a little bit about your diet i see here on your chart that you're a type two diabetic and it looked like that you were gon na handle that with diet and exercise let's talk about that a little bit","3717":"okay so other than the weight loss how how is your diet is that has that been working out for you i mean do you does does that does that fit your lifestyle pretty well","3718":"yeah and that can happen and one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods which is you know kind of the the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food and has that been difficult since you are watching your carb intake","3719":"okay and then do you have any family history of gallbladder disease","3720":"okay so both both your parents your mom and your dad had your had their gallbladders taken out","3721":"okay and then i wan na talk a little bit about your activity level and your and and if you're exercising has this affected your ability to to get out and exercise","3722":"that's awesome to hear yeah i my wife and i like to go over and take nature hikes through the new park behind the rex center that just opened up have you ever been over there to do any any picture taken we've got a bunch of beautiful nature pictures that we took about a week ago","3723":"yeah it's awesome","3724":"that's great yeah next time you come in maybe you can bring in some of your pictures that'd be awesome to see","3725":"so i'm just curious talking about your symptoms here have you had any fevers you mentioned something about nausea but have you actually vomited from those symptoms","3726":"okay so if it's okay with you i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure was one twenty eight over eighty eight respiratory rate was sixteen your pulse rate was sixty eight you were afebrile today which is a good thing and your oxygen saturation on room air was ninety nine percent taking a listen to your heart here your heart is regular of rate and rhythm no i do n't hear any ectopic beats no clicks rubs or murmurs noted listening to your lungs here they are clear and equal bilaterally to auscultation now i'm gon na go ahead and do an an abdominal exam i do note positive bowel sounds soft nondistended abdomen however you are positive for some slight guarding there to the right upper quadrant but i do n't note any rebound tenderness now i'm gon na press slightly here beneath your ribs on the right hand side now take a breath in does that hurt when i press so i i see that you're guarded there so i'm gon na say that that it did hurt when i it did hurt when i","3727":"okay that's that's no problem so you are positive for murphy's signs but i do n't appreciate any peritoneal signs so let's talk a little bit about your results that i reviewed before you came in today so your abdominal ultrasound shows multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder and i do appreciate some mild thickening now the common bile duct size is within normal limits at four . one millimeters now let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you okay i do believe you have some mild cholecystitis with gallstones i do n't appreciate any frank obstruction but it looks like your gallbladder is inflamed and it looks like that's happened maybe over the last few weeks since you've been having those symptoms now since you have n't had any improvement with dietary modifications i am going to make the recommendation that we do remove your gallbladder and i would like to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy now what that means is i'll make a few small incisions and insert a scope with some of those instruments that's gon na remove that gallbladder through one of those little bitty incisions now the surgery is gon na take about an hour to an hour and a half and you'll probably spend the night in the hospital because we just wan na monitor you post procedure to make sure everything is okay you're still gon na wan na avoid those high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are gon na be high in fiber now do you have any questions about what our assessment and plan is for for this","3728":"okay now the other thing","3729":"so the good news is since it's a laparoscopic procedure you're gon na be back on your feet pretty quick now for the first twenty four hours i'm gon na want you to take it pretty easy but after a couple of days if you feel like moving around on some solid ground you know we do n't want you hiking or anything like that but if you feel like moving around on some solid ground you can get up and walk around within a day or two and then in about a week or so i'll see you again and then we'll release you to go get back out there in nature","3730":"you're very welcome the other thing i wan na talk briefly about is now your not your type two diabetes i want you to follow up with your physician just to make sure that you're handling your diabetes especially the fact that you're gon na have surgery and those type of things and we will just continue to monitor your diabetes as has been outlined by your your additional either your endocrinologist or your primary care provider i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get some paperwork signed and if you do n't have any questions for me i will see you next week and we will get this gallbladder out","3731":"alright that sounds good we'll see you next week then","3732":"hi matthew how are you the medical assistant told me that you injured your shoulder","3733":"what happened","3734":"okay alright and so when exactly did this happen","3735":"okay well i'm happy at age 67 you're out there playing tackle football so good good for you and was it your right shoulder or your left shoulder that you injured","3736":"okay and are you right or left handed","3737":"okay and have you had any numbing or tingling in your fingers at all","3738":"okay and any problems with the strength of the arm at all are you able to grab a cup of coffee","3739":"okay and where exactly on your shoulder does it hurt","3740":"mm-hmm okay alright and are you able to lift up your shoulder so that your shoulder touches your ear at all","3741":"okay alright and what have you taken for the pain","3742":"did that help at all","3743":"okay so are your symptoms any better since it happened or they about the same","3744":"okay and any neck problems did you injure your neck when this happened","3745":"okay and any other joint problems like does your elbow hurt on that side or your wrist or is it just your shoulder","3746":"okay and any other orthopedic injuries in the past have you ever injured that shoulder before as far as you know","3747":"okay and any any other surgeries or any other medical problems","3748":"okay alright well i'm just gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out my exam findings i'll let you know what that means so and last thing have you had any fever or chills since this happened at all","3749":"okay did you hit your head when you when this happened","3750":"okay alright did you pass out","3751":"okay alright well looking at your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever your blood pressure looks quite good it's about one twenty two over seventy six your heart rate is appropriate at eighty two beats per minute and your oxygenation is ninety five percent on room air on your cervical spine exam there is no tenderness to palpation of the cervical spine there is full range of motion on head exam there does not appear to be any trauma there is no ecchymosis or bruising on the right shoulder exam on your musculoskeletal exam there is pain to palpation of the posterior shoulder at the acromioclavicular joint there is decreased abduction and adduction to about ninety degrees only there is there is a he has pain with supination and pronation of the right arm and there is a palpable radial radial artery pulse okay so what does that mean that just means that you have some you know evidence of the injury there and we'll we're gon na talk about that so i had the nurse do a shoulder x-ray on you before i came in the room and the results of your right shoulder x-ray showed that you have an acute acromioclavicular joint fracture so you just have a a a small fracture of the acromion i do n't think that it it's gon na be anything that we need to do surgery for so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your right shoulder injury for your acute acromioclavicular joint fracture i wan na go ahead and just put you in a sling for now i wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i wan na go ahead and just order a cat scan of your right shoulder just to kinda get a better look of how the joint looks and we're gon na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to strengthen your shoulder in hopes of avoiding surgery in the future how does that sound","3752":"okay do you think you need something stronger than meloxicam","3753":"okay any questions","3754":"well you ca n't play taggle football for a while you have to have this fracture healed","3755":"and i would avoid doing it you know as we get older you know our bones get a little bit weaker so i would avoid the tackle football maybe flag football in the future okay","3756":"okay anything else","3757":"okay you're welcome have a good day bye","3758":"hi jeremy how are you the medical assistant told me that you injured your back","3759":"okay how long ago did that happen","3760":"about four months ago okay that's quite a long time and you're just seeing me now for it","3761":"okay and what exactly are your symptoms are you having pain when you're just sitting there or when you're moving around for a very short period of time","3762":"okay are you still getting that numbing and tingling periodically in your feet or is that completely gone","3763":"okay and how about any difficulty or weakness in your legs","3764":"okay and are and do you still have pain down there in your lower back","3765":"okay and what have you been taking for the pain","3766":"okay is the ibuprofen any better than the tylenol","3767":"okay and did you get any stomach upset from the ibuprofen","3768":"okay and did you go to like an urgent care centing or an emergency room have you had any imaging on this at all","3769":"okay alright and any other symptoms any problems with like your bladder or your bowels any incontinence or you know you feel like you ca n't go to the bathroom","3770":"okay alright and any other any other past medical history do you that you have any","3771":"okay and what did you have done to your right knee","3772":"okay a total knee replacement in twenty eighteen is that what you said","3773":"okay alright alright well i wan na go ahead and just move on to a physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings","3774":"now you have you had any fever or chills with this","3775":"okay alright alright so looking at your vital signs here in the office you know they look really good your you you do n't have any temperature your blood pressure is good it's about one seventeen over fifty six","3776":"your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty eight and your oxygenation is fine at ninety five percent on room air so that means everything looks good","3777":"on your neck exam i i do appreciate some bony protuberance of the c5 c6 do you have any pain when i touch here","3778":"no okay on your lumbar spine exam i do appreciate do you have pain when i touch here","3779":"okay so there is no pain to palpation of the lumbar spine there is decreased flexion and extension of the lower back the patient does have a positive straight leg raise and there is some spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine on musculoskeletal exam the lower extremities strength is equal bilaterally so what does that mean jeremy that means that you have some you know maybe a some arthritis in your neck here and or maybe just a a little bit of some injury from from that from that back that back thing that you told me about","3780":"okay but i think overall things look really good so you know i had them do an lumbar spine x-ray on you before i saw you and i looked at the results of your lumbar spine x-ray which showed no acute bony abnormality you know there was no fracture of your back or anything which is not surprising based on your history so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so i do believe it sounds like you have an acute disk herniation now this did happen a few months ago but it sounds like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having symptoms","3781":"i do wan na go ahead and order a a lumbar spine mri to get a a a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they do n't show us any of the soft tissue so let's go ahead and order the lumbar spine mri i wan na continue with physical therapy so i'm going to refer you to a a physical therapist through our health system","3782":"and then i also wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day","3783":"to help with that do you have any questions about that","3784":"now if you do have a herniated disk we can go ahead and talk about some other treatment options maybe like an epidural steroid injection to help take down some of that inflammation","3785":"it might make you feel better but we'll we'll deal with that when we get get there okay","3786":"any questions","3787":"okay great thank you","3788":"so dennis is a 57 -year-old male today complaining of shortness of breath he has also got a history of diabetes high blood pressure and history of asthma so dennis tell me what's going on how're you doing","3789":"okay how long have you been feeling not too well","3790":"couple of weeks tell me what's going on","3791":"have you noticed any are you coughing up anything any swelling in your legs or what's going on","3792":"okay how long has that been going on for","3793":"okay and are you coughing a lot of blood or just a little bit of blood","3794":"wow that's a lot of blood okay are you throwing up any blood are you having bleeding in any place else or just when you cough","3795":"okay have you noticed any bruising or bleeding from your teeth or anything like that or from your gums or anything like that","3796":"okay any leg swelling or calf swelling or any any anything like that any recent travel history you've been on a plane or trip recently","3797":"okay so that's not near the knee problem okay and have you had any have you been to the hospital or been to the emergency room or anything like that for your coughing and coughing up blood","3798":"alright and alright no but no fevers with this so since you're here your oxygen level looks pretty good in the clinic it's about ninety four percent on pulse your pulse oxygenation so that's good are you short of breath so when you walk or you or you exert yourself you're short of breath you said right okay and have you and how how is your blood sugar been doing since this has been going on i know you're on metformin how's your diabetes been doing","3799":"okay and","3800":"okay alright so it's been running a little bit high i know we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time and it was about seven . seven . i think and we had talked about you know improving your diet and improving some exercise but is this blood sugar been high and low or high and normal when you're especially in the last three weeks or has it been going on for longer than that","3801":"okay alright and how is your blood pressure been at home since you've been taking since these episodes that you've been sick are you taking norvasc","3802":"okay alright and right now it's about a hundred and twenty over seventy what how low does it go in the more when you check it","3803":"okay alright well let me let me examine you here in a second and we'll think about you know what we need to do especially with your coughing and your shortness of breath okay so nita i'm i'm examining you now let's pretend i did my exam i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put it into my chart okay and i'll explain what those things mean so on my exam you've got no jvd there is no swelling in your neck no carotid bruits your lung exam you've got some rails and some rhonchi on on more on the right side i do n't hear any wheezing right now there is some diminished breath sounds in the right side as well on your heart exam you've got two over successolic ejection murmur you've had that in the past that's unchanged from before the rest regular rate and rhythm otherwise your belly exam is nice and soft on your extremity exam you've got one plus nonpitting edema on both of your lower extremities on your on your ankles no calf tenderness no negative homan sign so what does all this mean so basically you've got you know you've got some sort of infection or something going on in your lungs that i can hear right now the rest of your exam is pretty much stable it's unchanged from before so let's talk about what we what we should do about this so for the for the first problem with the shortness of breath the first thing i wan na do is go ahead and get a chest x-ray for you okay you've been coughing up blood i also wan na send you to the emergency department to get some blood testing done i'm worried about a blood clot or something else going on so i wan na get a cat scan of your chest as well so i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to the emergency department i'll call them and and have you head over that way they can get a chest x-ray and a cat scan and some blood work as well and then we'll evaluate why you're having the shortness of breath and why you're coughing up this blood okay and then depending on what they find you may need you know it could be as simple as a pneumonia or it could be something a little bit more serious we may have to get you know start you know depending on what you find we will get the right treatment started any questions about that or can you drive to the emergency department from here or is that okay","3804":"alright for the second problem for the diabetes since your blood sugar is running a little bit high once you get over this i'm blood sugars running a little bit high once we get you over this hump of the shortness of breath and get this diagnosed i'm gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c today we will probably increase your dose of metformin from five hundred twice a day to seven fifty twice a day so why do n't we do that and then why do n't we have we'+C20:C23ll have the hemoglobin a1c back and then we can once you get over this illness that you're undergoing we'll we'll we'll discuss that more i'll have you come back in about three weeks to just discuss your diabetes and what our treatment plan will be for that okay","3805":"for the high blood pressure definitely hold off on the norvasc for right now let's figure out what's going what's causing this episode of shortness of breath i want some blood testing done and and once we have that under better control we can reassess your blood pressure so right now hold the norvasc and then we'll have you come back once everything is done okay","3806":"any other questions or anything we know if we need to talk about today","3807":"doctor: sounds good we'll get you signed out here in a second","3808":"alright scott so so i understand that you you had some right knee injury can you tell me a little bit about what happened","3809":"okay and and how long ago did that happen","3810":"three days okay and when did you notice any swelling anything like that","3811":"okay alright and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to ten one being the least pain ten being the worst pain how's how's it been ranging","3812":"okay alright and did you take anything at all to relieve the pain","3813":"okay alrighty and did that help","3814":"gotcha okay now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then","3815":"okay alright and then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all","3816":"gotcha okay alright well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before i take a look at your knee here i'm gon na do a physical exam and in terms of your gait here i did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation so let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick i do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of ecchymosis let me just feel around here scott how does that feel does that hurt when i kinda press on that there","3817":"yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel","3818":"okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam fifty milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan","3819":"yeah definitely so yeah so you you can limit the activities for sure in terms of your work activities i know if you sit too long sometimes it can be painful because you do need to move that leg a little bit so it does n't lock up so i i would like for you to you know do do some slight activities not enough to stress your legs but definitely move move them a little bit every now and then so it does n't lock up on you okay","3820":"alright i do want you to i know you are i know you actually jog often so i want you to just slow that down for a bit no jogging for a while until we get you know results of your mri till we figure out what we what we are gon na be doing okay","3821":"alright and how's your dog you has it been jogging with you before this incident","3822":"your your dog","3823":"very good alright well i'm gon na go ahead and have the nurse take you to the scheduler to get your mri and i'll get back with you as soon as we get the results of that","3824":"doctor: thank you","3825":"alright teresa i see here in your chart that you seem to be experiencing some elbow pain could you tell me where it hurts","3826":"mm-hmm","3827":"i am so sorry so i mean that's really cool that you do parttery it's something that i've wanted to pick up you know but i do n't know that i have those skills yet does the pain radiate down your arm or up your shoulder or anything","3828":"okay so the medial aspect okay have you did you hit it on anything","3829":"okay and have you ever injured your elbow before","3830":"okay alright so on a on a scale of one to ten with ten being your arm is actively being sought off by a chainsaw how bad is the pain","3831":"wow that's pretty bad does it keep you up at night","3832":"okay have you done anything to relieve the pain","3833":"okay and have you tried anything like ice or heat or anything else","3834":"mm-hmm","3835":"okay okay so it's probably it do you think it's getting worse","3836":"okay no i understand okay so i know that you also have like a history of hypertension and that we have you on ten milligrams of lisinopril have you been checking your blood pressures regularly","3837":"okay alright and okay do you think that you've been good about taking your medications do you usually take them everyday","3838":"awesome that's great alright and so i see that you also we are treating you for diabetes as well and that we have you on five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day how about that have you been taking that regularly","3839":"okay alright so when you say a sweet tooth what are we talking about there","3840":"okay cinnamon rolls can be kind of hard like do you for your cakes do you do you use fondant you know to like do any of the decorations","3841":"so you know it's good","3842":"alright well so i totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family but we maybe wan na start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves is do you think that's something we could manage","3843":"mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a","3844":"yeah that sounds like a great idea and i think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice you know i do n't wan na as much as it's really helpful to have friends i do wan na be able to give you like a source of truth right","3845":"a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay","3846":"yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far","3847":"mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on","3848":"mm-hmm","3849":"okay that's awesome so like how about about how long are your walks","3850":"wow that's intense i was not expecting that number that's awesome okay alright so maybe this five pounds is muscle we're gon na go for it okay but thank you but that's some really important information but i'm gon na start your physical exam now okay","3851":"alright so i know that you said that you are experiencing elbow pain could you tell me is it your left or your right elbow","3852":"okay alright right elbow when i touch it does it hurt on the inside","3853":"okay so moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle when you turn like when you turn your wrist is if you're trying to open a door knob do you experience pain","3854":"alright so turning out no pain but when you turn your wrist inwards do you have any pain","3855":"okay so pain with resisted pronation of right forearm when you rest your arm on a table with the palm side up alright i want you to raise your hand by bending the wrist do you experiencing any pain","3856":"alright alright so when you are when i'm pressing here and like flexing your wrist are you experiencing any pain","3857":"alright pain with flexion and when bending the wrist alright when i listen to you you know i'm just gon na check your heart and lungs everything sounds sounds good no murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear bilaterally to bilaterally to auscultation i'm not noticing any rash for your at your elbow i do n't notice any bruising any swelling we do wan na note that tenderness but otherwise there is no discoloration no lesions so that's good your pulses and are equal bilaterally and i think i think we have an idea of what we are dealing with here okay so i'm gon na go ahead and give you my impression and plan for your your first problem like your primary problem that you are here for is right elbow pain it's consistent with medial epicondylitis and that it just means it's pain caused from overuse and damage to the tendons in your arm what we are gon na do is rest it i'm gon na order a sling for your right arm and you can wear this while you're awake well i want you to apply ice to your elbow for twenty minutes three times a day i'm going to i'm gon na ask you to take six hundred milligrams of ibuprofen that's three pills every six hours with food and you can take that for one week i know it's really important that you said that you have something that a gift that you wan na make for your son but we're gon na hold off on pottery for the next couple of weeks just to give your arm a chance to heal you know like it's awesome that you wan na be able to do these things for your family but sometimes you know your body is not where your where your where your heart is like where your heart and your head are right and then so","3858":"absolutely that's awesome and so it'll be like a a movie like coming soon to a shelf near you that's great for your second problem right we have this longstanding diabetes i want to increase your metformin to a thousand milligrams twice a day i know that you're saying you're having a hard time keeping up with that so i want you to do a good job of like checking and recording your blood sugars every day i do need you to follow up with me in a couple weeks i also wan na order something called an a1c since you are having a hard time with like the blood like the blood sugars everyday an a1c will give me a more accurate picture of like a longer period of time and then we might need to evaluate like what are what other options that we have if your sugars if we ca n't get them a bit more under control i do want you to follow up with me in a couple of weeks about the about your diabetes and for your third problem of hypertension we're just gon na continue you on your lisinopril at ten milligrams that's it seems to be doing it's job i'm really i'm really glad about that and it's probably due to the walking that you're doing i forgot to mention for your diabetes we are gon na i'm gon na recommend a a referral to diabetic counseling that way you can get like a bit more information on like the steps that you can take to help you with that","3859":"your x-ray honestly looks great in that i do n't see any kind of fracture or bony abnormality so that's what makes me think that this is like a tendon related thing right so in reviewing your x-ray like it it does support the the the assessment and plan that i have given you i","3860":"yeah absolutely i do think for your your primary problem the elbow that we might wan na get put you in some physical rehab if the problem is taking a little longer to heal but we'll discuss that at your next visit here okay","3861":"alright no problem any other questions","3862":"doctor: alright thank you for keeping me accountable","3863":"good morning noah tell me a little bit about why you are here today","3864":"okay can you tell me a little bit more about it how did it start or how did it do you remember injuring yourself","3865":"okay and is it anywhere in specific is it in the middle of the back across the whole low back or on one side or the other","3866":"okay and that's when you get the pain more","3867":"i also heard you say you know if you twist suddenly that makes it worse is that correct","3868":"now you know i was looking at your records and i know you have that history of diabetes and i have n't seen you a while for a follow-up for that how you've been feeling","3869":"okay so you're on","3870":"yeah i think i think you're on that metformin twice a day","3871":"yeah okay","3872":"do you test your blood sugar at home in the mornings","3873":"and how have those numbers been","3874":"well if","3875":"yeah if i remember right your family do n't they own that that bakery down on the corner of main street and did n't they own that","3876":"and how do you do you stay away from those i i got ta be honest i love i love the cakes and donuts they make those are delicious","3877":"well let me so we're gon na have to watch that and i'll come back and we'll talk a little bit about the diabetes but let's go ahead and do that i do n't wan na do a a a quick physical exam on you i'm gon na look in your eyes here and so let me quickly look in your ears","3878":"okay that looks good and any let me let me listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and your heart it's a regular rate and rhythm that's all good as we go through that now i want you to sit up here i'm gon na press down your back starting at the top and any pain up top no","3879":"okay and then once i get down here and around that low back i wan na press in the center first does that cause you a lot of pain","3880":"yeah okay","3881":"okay and if i come over here to the right no","3882":"okay so and then on the left hand side if i push down here kind of into your butt","3883":"yeah okay","3884":"lay back on the stretcher for me for a second i'm gon na go ahead and and lift your legs for me or i'm gon na go ahead and lift your legs for you just relax i'm gon na start here on the right side when i lift that right leg up does that cause you significant pain or any pain at all","3885":"okay let me come around let me lift up the left side if i lift that up does that cause","3886":"i can see that gritts on your face so okay that's good and you know as i look at your lower extremities there is no pain or numbness or tingling in your feet or anything like that","3887":"okay okay so lem me talk a little bit about my impression and plan so for that low back pain i believe you have a musculoskeletal low back strain i'm going to order a low back x-ray so we'll order that and get that done as an outpatient i do n't expect to see anything significant but it's gon na tell me how those joint spaces look and if you know if we're dealing with any disk issue but that will be the start of it and i'm also gon na order some physical therapy two for two reasons to help with a little bit with the pain but also strengthen some of the muscles there in the back so those are the two things that we are gon na do now i want you to take take four hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that occasionally with some tylenol when the pain gets more severe up to about three times a day i'm gon na also give you a prescription for some flexeril that's a muscle relaxant and i want you to take one of those once a day every evening but be careful if you're doing any strenuous or hazardous activities such as driving after you take those now for your diabetes my impression is that your diabetes is is under control i noticed that we do n't have n't had a a1c for almost five months so i'm also gon na order an a1c so we can find out where we are with that continue with your diet and exercise we know that's really important and then continue with your metformin i'm not gon na make any changes today but we'll go ahead and look at that once i get that results of that a1c do you have any questions for me","3888":"i would yes it's nice for you to go to the bakery but you ca n't have any donuts i'm no i you just really need to watch that intake of of anything that you might get at the at the bakery so just just be careful with those carbohydrates those sweets that you're taking as we go through your day it's occasional occasional one perfectly fine but on a routine basis we need to watch that","3889":"yeah i that's a great question i'm really glad you asked that i would prefer that you're taking your blood pressure every morning the first thing you get up when you get up in the morning that's gon na give me a good idea and so if you can do that the first thing in the morning and keep a record of it you know i know your glucometer keeps a record of it but if you can write them down and once we get that a1c that's gon na give me a little more guidance on how to deal with your blood your diabetes","3890":"not yet let's let's get the that's a great question i may end up referring you to a a pain doctor for that low back pain but i really would like to start with some of the diagnostics first let's get an x-ray and if there is you know any question of that x-ray and the pain continues i'm gon na go ahead and maybe order a cat scan and then at that point in time we can refer you to a pain doctor if we're still having significant pain","3891":"okay thank you i'm gon na send my nursing to see you and we'll get you out the door","3892":"take care","3893":"hi gregory how are you i the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee","3894":"how long ago did that happen","3895":"two and a half weeks ago and what what knee is bothering you","3896":"the outside of your right knee","3897":"okay and did you actually fall down when this happened or","3898":"and no okay so now it clicks when you walk okay does it hurt when you walk","3899":"okay and what have you taken for the pain","3900":"does the ibuprofen work","3901":"does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there","3902":"okay and are you able to do things like bending or things like that","3903":"okay alright now you said squats are you are you active are you doing like burpees going to","3904":"okay alright well i have a peloton who is your favorite instructor","3905":"okay what kind of rides do you like","3906":"i ca n't picture you as a regade person so that's interesting to know okay alright and any numbing or tingling in your foot at all","3907":"okay when did you break your toe","3908":"okay so you do have some numbing and tingling but it's not new","3909":"alright alright well let's just go ahead and i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out my exam findings i'll let you know what that means so on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some slight edema you do have a slight effusion does it hurt when i press on the outside of your knee","3910":"okay there is no pain to palpation of the right lateral knee i'm gon na be bending your knee in all sorts of positions does that hurt","3911":"okay the patient has a positive varus test there is full range of motion there is a negative lachman sign the patient does on cardiovascular exam the patient does have a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse okay well let's just i wan na talk a little bit about i had the nurse do an x-ray on you and i looked at the results of your knee x-ray and it does n't show any acute fracture or bony abnormality which is not surprising based on your injury so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so i think you do have a a lateral a lateral collateral ligament strain based on your exam findings and this this type of injury essentially can be healed by itself you know i do n't think we're gon na need to refer you to surgery or anything like that i want you to go ahead and i'm gon na prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i do wan na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those muscles and areas around that injury then that will make your knee stronger it help prevent future injuries are you able to ice it at all during the day now you said you working you work in sales so you said you're home","3912":"okay and so does that help at all","3913":"okay do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or better","3914":"okay alright well let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy if you're still having pain then we might have to consider an mri","3915":"any questions about that","3916":"okay alright well it was very nice seeing you today call me if you need anything","3917":"okay bye","3918":"hi dennis how are you today","3919":"so what what brings you into the office i do n't believe i have ever seen you before here","3920":"okay now tell me a little bit about this triathlon training what do you are you are you running far are you tell me kind of how you work out for that today","3921":"wow that's that's a that's an aggressive campaign to get there so really hope you get that triathlon in so you're how many days a week does this occur that you're training","3922":"okay on your running days or when you do the running tell me a little bit about your stretching routine do you are you aggressive stretchers you do not stretch at all i know people that do both","3923":"okay and i'm assuming that with the bicycle either you do n't really work the lower legs to get them stretched out you just jump on and go correct","3924":"okay tell me a little bit about the pain is you said it it's after the activity but it you when you first wake up in the morning it it's it's there also","3925":"no go ahead go ahead","3926":"okay okay i'm sure this is impacting that ability to to really focus on your training uh as you're going with that with that type of a pain so lem me go ahead and let's let's take a look at your your and your lower extremities here and yeah okay so roll up your pants yeah okay good now does your left leg hurt at all do you get that severe pain or is it mainly on the right","3927":"okay okay so i'm gon na just hold your leg here and i want you to take your your foot and ankle and i want you to go ahead and just pull your your toes up towards you does that create some pain when you do that","3928":"a little bit okay now i'm just gon na hold your foot up and i want you to push against me and does that hurt","3929":"yeah okay okay roll over here on my my stretcher for me and i want you to dangle your your feet over the edge and what i wan na do is i just wan na i'm gon na squeeze your left calf first and when i do that does that hurt on your left side","3930":"and i'm gon na squeeze on the right side anything there","3931":"okay okay well that's good your your thompson test is negative that's a really good finding and i just wan na continue pressing here on your right from your heel when i squeeze your heel does that cause significant pain at all","3932":"yeah okay and if i come up a little bit further as i i run up that achilles tendon does that hurt","3933":"yeah okay okay great not great so yeah go ahead and sit up for me so dennis my diagnosis is achilles tendinitis and it's really from overuse when we see this frequently when somebody starts to you know get in and train aggressively for an event i'm unfortunately i'm gon na have to ask you to stop training for a a week or two i know that's concerning but i really want this to heal before we move into that next phase i did n't ask you about medication but i'm assuming whatever you were doing was n't working significantly so what i'd like you to do is take some ibuprofen or advil that's the same medication and i want you to take three tablets every six hours and that's really an anti-inflammatory see if we can eliminate some of that tendinitis type pain that you're getting that inflammation around that achilles tendon i'm gon na also order a couple physical therapy visits and the reason for that is i'd like you to get some strength and stretching understanding i think it's important for you especially here at the beginning is to get some of that real stretching knowledge in and learn how to stretch those muscles before you start these activities and they are gon na help strengthen your your lower extremities also and i want you to come back to me within you know a week to ten days following your first couple physical therapy appointments so i can monitor how you're doing i see no reason for an x-ray at this point but if this continues we're gon na you know if you're still having pain ten days in significant pain without change modification of your activity then we may have to look at more aggressive treatment plans how does that sound for you","3934":"okay hey did you happen to catch that pittsburgh pang one hockey game last night","3935":"my gosh the the pang ones are on fire you know they beat up on new york seven to two i mean the hockey's just an amazing sport i i just do you guy do you do a lot of hockey down there in town here","3936":"no yeah detroit is a hockey town yeah the red wings okay well i'm gon na go ahead and i'll send my nurse in and go ahead and get you discharged and like i said i'd like to see you back here in seven to ten days after that first physical therapy appointment i've got a great phenomenal office staff you just call in once that gets scheduled they will get you in to that next available appointment so take care and i will talk to you later","3937":"so hey christina good to see you today i see you're here you have a nonhealing foot ulcer well also looks like in my notes that you got some you've got type two diabetes and that probably the reason for your ear but ulcer not healing so how you doing today what's going on","3938":"okay how long has that wound been present","3939":"a year well that that's a that's a a long time so when it started i guess did you have any trauma to the foot or did was it just all of a sudden","3940":"okay when was the last time you were on antibiotics","3941":"five months alright do you remember which antibiotics you were on","3942":"keflex alright so kinda does your foot hurt or is it just just the","3943":"alright so you've got neuropathy yeah that that that makes sense with the the diabetes so have you had any other symptoms like a fever chills any drainage coming from it","3944":"okay alright well that that sounds good so today is thursday so what do you have for the weekend","3945":"no yeah i yeah i know you do have that diabetes i know your pcp probably would n't be excited about you you eating out and all that but you know hopefully we can we i can at least get your your foot a little bit better so your diabetes i know we talked a little bit earlier how is that going for you is it controlled you know what's your your blood sugars running","3946":"okay alright yeah i i you probably definitely need to get back with your pcp about that because the a1c is is pretty high and i know he probably had you on some medication and insulin and metformin and insulin just to try to to get that lower but","3947":"you know we are here for your foot so let's let me take a look at that so we will do a quick exam of your foot so you do n't have any fever your vitals look good so on your your right foot exam i can see here you do have a one by two centimeter two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint i do see some yellow slough that's present with minimal granulation tissue you have no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there is n't any evidence of fluid collection i do n't see necrosis so there is no dead tissue around it there's no odor and i i do n't appreciate any bony exposure and does it hurt when i touch it here","3948":"okay so we did a x-ray of your right foot before you came in and it showed no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that there is no bone infection which is really good so let me just talk a little about my assessment and plan of your your foot so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer so what i'm gon na do is i'm going to order a abi or ankle brachial index and that's just to determine your blood supply just to see if we can actually heal that wound i know it's been there for about a year which is a pretty long time and so we just need to see if we can if you do have that blood flow just in case we need to to make other goals for that foot just to depend upon that i'm also gon na do a debridement here have you had that done before of the","3949":"okay so you know you know pretty much about that so i'm just gon na try to take off some of that dead tissue we'll do that here in the office afterwards and then i'm going to prescribe you some colaganase ointment and you could just add that to your wound once a day and cover it with a sterile dressing and we're gon na try to continue that until we see it start to shrink and hopefully you know that will work between the debridement and then the ointment did they give you at your pcp they give you a surgical shoe or have you been wearing your regular shoes","3950":"okay so we're gon na get you a surgical shoe and i want you to to wear that and that can help you take pressure off the area because i know you said you're gon na walk around with this zoo this this weekend so i definitely do n't want you to put much pressure on it from now on and hopefully that can help it heal and so after all that i'm just gon na see you back in two weeks and we could take another look and possible do another debridement of the ulcer so do you have any questions for me","3951":"alright so i'll see you back in two weeks and i hope you have fun at the zoo this weekend","3952":"doctor: alright thanks","3953":"alright julia so you've been coming to see me for a while now ever since you had an rca stent placed back in twenty eighteen but i see you're here for follow-up after an interior stemi where we had to put in another stent right so like how are you doing","3954":"wow so you were experiencing similar symptoms similar to what you had the first time","3955":"okay have you had any chest pain or shortness of breath","3956":"okay have you been able to like exercise at all since since you last saw me","3957":"awesome okay yeah you know because like fall is setting in like are you excited","3958":"do you have any like plans for the holiday","3959":"okay so i do wan na ask i know that you have a history of coronary artery disease hypertension and diabetes so i wan na get an idea of like where you stand with those have you been experiencing any kind of leg swelling","3960":"okay are you able to lie flat at night when you sleep","3961":"okay and then have you been able to afford your medications and are you taking them like your like you were prescribed","3962":"yeah that's very accurate you know like there are huge consequences to not taking them so if you are noticing any problems please please please please let us know how about your diet are you watching your salt intake","3963":"mm-hmm","3964":"what are you for her toppings on pizza","3965":"mm-hmm alright but you know that pepperoni is pretty high in salt on top of a cheesy pizza right","3966":"okay so we are we are gon na have to negotiate some of these diet things and then especially since you have diabetes like have you been managing that well","3967":"okay okay so you know maybe this is just a situation of like where we are on the right path but probably need to step up a few things okay","3968":"alright so i do want to do a quick physical exam so you are aware i'm going to be calling out my findings as i run through it alright","3969":"alright so your vital signs look good you know so i'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention so and then on top of that i'm not i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits so i'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam though there is a three over six systolic ejection murmur heard at the that i'm hearing at the left base that's not like a huge deal especially considering like what you've been through already in terms of the hospital but it is something that i wan na know in your chart when i listen to you your lungs your lungs are clear over here with your extremities i do notice you know some lower lower edema swelling sorry some lower swelling edema lower limb edema and it it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery the cath site is clean dry and intact without hematoma and i also your right radial artery pulses are palpable so i did review the results of your ekg and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good r wave progression and a a evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a stemi one of the reasons though that we had you come in is that we noticed on your echo there is a reduced ejection fraction of thirty five percent we are a little bit concerned about that so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary and like first diagnosis is gon na be coronary artery disease right you already have a history of that but you know we're gon na do some things to make we're gon na continue to evaluate that over time i want you to continue your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and your brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily i wan na continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor and you're gon na be taking that eighty milligrams a day and we're gon na continue you on your toprol and that's gon na be fifty milligrams daily i am gon na refer you to cardiac rehab so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to get back to exercising regularly i know it was kinda scary to have such an episode but i promise like most of the patients i have love cardiac rehab and i think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis we have newly you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation what i think is like what that means is that you're you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit concerning but i think like given your history that it will improve over time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly so i think that the muscle is just kinda like stunned like surprised and since you're compliant with your meds i think you will recover we are gon na continue you on your lisinopril twenty milligrams daily however considering that you are retaining fluid i think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure i'm gon na prescribe something called a diuretic it's called lasix and i do want to we need to take that forty milligrams once a day i wan na add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and i need you to get labs finally we will repeat another echo in about two months last but not least there is the hypertension your blood pressure seems fine i think with the aldactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider like what other diet options might be available to you maybe suggestions of things that you have n't thought about like cutting out meat especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni but maybe finding you some alternatives how does that sound","3970":"yes yeah i i strongly believe this is our best course of action and that you will get better given enough time i i see that you are making efforts i'm really glad that you are out there walking and that you're cognizant of your diet and willing to make changes we will just you know monitor it over time okay","3971":"doctor: alright thank you","3972":"hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on","3973":"yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta","3974":"and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that","3975":"you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so","3976":"so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging","3977":"no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time","3978":"okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies","3979":"okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking","3980":"okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet","3981":"i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist","3982":"that's your kidney doctor","3983":"okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil","3984":"okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span","3985":"so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again","3986":"you can take tylenol","3987":"yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur on your heart which i've heard before in the past and it does n't it does n't look like you're retaining any fluid which is good but you do have a little puffiness in your legs which sometimes some of the medications can cause","3988":"so let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and and plan for you going forward so for your first problem of your coronary artery disease i think you're doing really well i wan na go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in in exercising again okay and i am gon na go ahead and refill your metoprolol your crestor forty milligrams once a day as well as the aspirin okay i do n't think we need to proceed with a a stress test or anything at this time but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay","3989":"okay for your","3990":"good for your second problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i am gon na reach out to doctor miller and make an appointment for you to be seen just because again i think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay","3991":"and then for your third problem of your diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c and i'm gon na put that referral in for the dietitian to give you some dietary education and i'm gon na go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your your insulin regimen okay","3992":"any questions","3993":"yeah i mean are you having any thoughts of of harming yourself or harming others","3994":"you feel kinda down what's your","3995":"what well i do n't think so what what's your support system like","3996":"okay alright well would you be interested in in like a referral to psychiatry or something like that so that you have someone to talk to about some of of issues because medication can help but i do i think it's important to have you know talk some of these things out","3997":"okay so why do n't we go ahead and i'm gon na place a referral to psychiatry for you know you know difficulty adjusting after having a heart attack maybe some some mild depression okay does that sound okay okay","3998":"okay you're welcome anything else","3999":"yep i'm gon na put them into the computer and and whatever pharmacy you want yep mm-hmm","4000":"okay you're welcome i'll be in touch bye","4001":"yeah so sorry so barbara is a 31 -year-old female and she has history of diabetes type two and asthma and she is here today with abdominal pain so barbara tell me a little more about your abdominal pain what's been going on","4002":"okay alright and so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what","4003":"okay alright and along with the pain have you had any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea","4004":"okay okay and and so and you vomited how many times","4005":"okay alright been drinking a lot of coffee you said too uh is that is that starbucks i love those nitrocolbrus and starbucks we ever had those those are incredible","4006":"that's","4007":"yeah the for sure you got ta go venti on that you really have to coax them into it though they wo n't even give you it's it's like you need a license to get a venti on that that nitro it's so strong so that's my achilles heel i tell you but okay so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain uh you you you you've been drinking more coffee and maybe that's related as you're thinking","4008":"okay yeah okay and so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it","4009":"hmmm okay","4010":"okay alright understood you've not had any fever with that pain have you","4011":"okay alright and so how about your diabetes how's your diabetes been doing how your blood sugars been what low one hundreds two hundreds where where is it","4012":"okay good and you're still taking the metformin five hundred milligrams once a day right no actually it looks like last visit we increased that to five hundred milligrams twice per day is that correct","4013":"okay good good and then for your asthma have you had any recent asthma attacks and are you still taking the flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed for wheezing","4014":"yep okay","4015":"yeah well better to stay on the flovent daily and then just use the albuterol if you need it but if you stay on the flovent daily it will decrease the frequency of those attacks so yeah alright well let's go ahead and examine you okay so on your physical exam it's pretty normal for the most part unremarkable but i i'll i'll say on your on your heart exam you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam and and i'm not worried about that we're kinda watching that but it just means i hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving and otherwise normal heart exam for your abdominal exam you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen your abdomen's otherwise soft there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever and there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant so i think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen so i think that you know that may be you may be right this could be some gastritis so so then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam you do have some mild end expiratory wheezes very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam so let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here so first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain i do think that you have acute gastritis and i think this is probably related to the caffeine intake and i i know that you've had a a moderately heavy history of alcohol use too so i want you to cut back on the alcohol as well you know keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great and then also cut back on the caffeine and that should help and i'm going to write you a prescription for zantac as well as we need and so i'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain and then i'm going to check a urinalysis a urine pregnancy test a cbc a comprehensive metabolic panel as well and we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on and then for your second problem of diabetes type two let's continue you on the metformin but i wan na adjust the dose slightly i'm gon na increase the morning dose to one thousand milligrams and the evening dose we can keep at five hundred so we'll go metformin one thousand milligrams in the morning and five hundred milligrams in the evening please continue to check your blood sugars let me know what they are when you come back you know we just keep track of those and then we'll see you back in four weeks by the way i wan na have you follow up with me in four weeks and for your third problem of asthma let's continue you on the flovent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily and then also albuterol as needed so how does that sound for a plan any other questions comments suggestions","4016":"okay yeah i'd also recommend while this is hurting you definitely cut back on the spices the spicy food easier said than done sometimes i know but yep yep alright sounds good well listen i'll see you back in four weeks give me a holler if if you have any questions or anything else in the meantime","4017":"doctor: alright you take care sure you got","4018":"good afternoon alexis i understand you're having some issues with your hand","4019":"okay how long has that been going on","4020":"okay okay and when does that numbness and tingling do you get a lot of pain with it first let me ask that question","4021":"some pain","4022":"okay and when you get this pain what makes it better is it stopping and just resting for a while or do you take medications or try other","4023":"your mouth okay","4024":"yeah when you're moving that around okay","4025":"does this pain ever wake you up in the middle of the night or the pain or the tingling","4026":"no okay","4027":"okay so and you're using motrin for for ibuprofen for for the pain well let me go ahead and take a take a look here at your is it both hands or just your right hand","4028":"mostly your right hand okay so let's go ahead and take a look at that right hand when i bend your wrist does that cause any pain","4029":"it does okay and so you do have some pain on extension and if you pull your your hand wrist up towards you does that cause the pain also","4030":"yeah okay so you do have pain on flexion and extension and when i touch the fingertips here now you said you had some numbness in your thumb and your index finger and a little bit in your your middle finger the other two fingers they feel okay or do you think that there is different than the other hand","4031":"okay so i i want you to grip my hands here and just squeeze tight okay so you do have a a little bit of a less grip strength on the right and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain and and numbness that you have going on now i want you to turn your arm over for me and i'm gon na touch on or tap on the inside of your wrist or or forearm and when i do that i can see your face you're grimacing so that that that must cause that shooting pain yeah okay so you do have a positive tinel's sign so in alexis what i think is going on is that you have a a carpal tunnel syndrome and we see that frequent","4032":"yeah you see this frequently but people who are doing data entry spend a lot of time on keyboards or you know some a lotta manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again and again will get that type of pain so here is my plan i'd like to put you in a splint and it's it's it's kind of a wrist splint i would like you to wear that at night that will help with that i want you to continue with the ibuprofens but i would like you to go up to six hundred milligrams four times a day and","4033":"we're gon na do that now i am going to order some a a outpatient test called an emg where we look at that nerve conduction study in that wrist and that's really what's happening here is you've got some thickening in the the in the wrist and the the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down and just compressing some of those nerves any other questions for me for now if that test comes back positive and we'll talk about that later on your next visit if it comes back positive we may have to do we're gon na stick with conservative treatment first but we may consider some surgery where i can go in and release that impingement on your nerves through your wrist it's a simple outpatient procedure and then i think you would feel better how does that sound","4034":"yeah we'll start with the the wrist splint and once i get the nerve conduction studies that will give me another idea whether or not i need to send you some physical therapy in addition or if we need to go directly to surgery but that will all hinge on that nerve conduction test do you so do you have any further questions","4035":"doctor: thank you very much","4036":"hey good to see you philip so i see here you're coming in you had some right elbow pain also you have a past medical history of hypertension diabetes we are gon na check up on those as well so can you tell me what happened to your elbow","4037":"okay okay so how old are your kids","4038":"okay yeah i know i i play with my kids sometimes and i think i'm getting too old to do all that so i just i've hurt myself before as well alright so with your your elbow what part of your elbow would you say hurts","4039":"anytime i move it do you remember falling","4040":"okay alright yeah that that that definitely makes sense so how would you describe the pain is it like a dull pain is it stabbing what what would you say","4041":"okay and does it radiate down your arm or does it stay in that one spot","4042":"radiates down the forearm alright so have you taken any medications for it to make it better","4043":"okay when you took it did it did it help at all did it change your your pain score","4044":"okay that's good alright so we'll we'll do a physical exam on that elbow we'll take a look at it in a second but i do wan na talk to you about your your hypertension you came in today i know you have past medical history of hypertension came in today your blood pressure's a little bit high it was a one fifty over seven over ninety which is pretty high today i see you're on twenty of lisinopril have you been taking that daily","4045":"okay so maybe you just have a little little white coat syndrome i know i have that myself and even though i'm a physician i i still do n't like to go to the doctor so i definitely understand how about your diet i know we talked a little bit about that before and you said kinda during the pandemic you fell off a little bit how you been doing that have you been lowering your salt intake","4046":"okay yeah that's good that that's that's definitely good yeah i know a lot of people during the pandemic it was you know sitting at home and and eating more than we should but that's i'm very happy that you've been compliant and you have that low salt diet so let's talk about your diabetes i think you see here on on five hundred of metformin are you taking that as well daily","4047":"okay and your blood sugars how have they been","4048":"okay yeah that's that's really good yeah so i that's that's pretty good so what we're gon na do we're gon na get a a1c just to see you know that range and it's possibility we can we can you know lower that metformin dosage but we will do that after your visit then we will take a look at that so lem me go ahead and will do that quick exam of your elbow but first i want to make sure you're not having any chest pain or anything like that","4049":"no belly pain","4050":"alright so listen to your lungs so your lungs are clear bilaterally listen to your heart so your heart exam you do still have that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur but we know it about that before so let me take a look at your elbow so when i press right here on the back of your elbow is that painful","4051":"alright so when i have you you you flex and extend it it's painful does that does that hurt","4052":"alright so your right elbow exam shows you have pain to palpation of the olecranon area of the posterior elbow you do have mild pain with flexion and extension but you do have also normal range of motion at that elbow so we we did do an x-ray before you came in and luckily nothing's broken no fracture no bony abnormality so it's a normal x-ray which is really good so let me just talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have a elbow contusion i believe your son did hit you with the lacrosse stick and it caused that that pain i see some swelling little inflammation there as well you have a little bit of a bruise i think that's that's what happened so for that i know you're having some pain i'm gon na prescribe you eight hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that twice a day and that should help with some of that swelling and pain i also want you to ice it three times a day for twenty minutes at a time that should also help with the swelling and pain and just for the time being for the next couple of weeks just you know maybe you know not play lacrosse with your son just to help that heal then you can get back on on the field so for your your high blood pressure we're just gon na keep you on the hypertension we'll just keep you on that twenty milligrams of lisinopril looks like you're doing great with that and your diet and then for your diabetes we will keep you on the five hundred milligrams of metformin and we will also get a a1c just to check your levels and see if we do need to adjust the medication in the future alright so do you have any questions for me","4053":"alright so we will see you next time and my nurse will be in with those prescriptions","4054":"patient is an 82 -year-old male with past medical history significant for hypertension and stage three chronic kidney disease who presents for hospital follow-up after an acute on chronic chf exacerbation alright hey hey kevin how are you doing

and check some glucose a complete metabolic panel some thyroid studies and liver panels and i wan na perform a genetic testing to see if this problem is familial or this is a secondary cause so we are also gon na go ahead i wan na follow up in a follow-up with a well balanced diet so including a variety of foods that are lower in saturated fat and sugars so i want you to follow that and i want you

pressure with you or mentioned that because we do n't have it in our system here yet but i did add it in today but we do n't have you on any medications yet for that","4121":"well i think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the your blood pressure was elevated so they had mentioned that i noticed a trend in your blood pressure it's been running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years","4122":"it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so","4123":"yeah me too but we we can we can definitely you know get you started on some monitoring devices for that and also maybe start you on some some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure and maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay","4124":"so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness so what does all this mean i'll explain that in a second so basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs so you know with this chest pain i'm a little bit so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily i'm also gon na give you a prescription just a baby aspirin you can take eighty one milligrams once a day and also i'm gon na give you a prescription for nitroglycerin it's a it's a little pill you split underneath your tongue if you have this chest pain if it does n't go away after one or two pills i want you to go to the hospital call nine one one and go to the hospital but we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart okay any questions about that","4125":"yeah if you if you stop walking the chest pain goes away you do n't have to take the pill but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away i would take the pill and see if it goes away if it does not","4126":"about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes and if it does n't go away then i would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because i worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it does n't lead to a heart attack those chest pain could be a you know a a a sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly","4127":"alright","4128":"and for the second problem the diabetes you know i think you're doing fairly well continue with your eye ophthalmology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today and i'm gon na have you come back in about two weeks and we can see if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away from you know the the pop and the sweet things and once we have your heart taken care of or make sure your heart is okay you can and we can hopefully resolve this chest pain that you're having get back to your exercise regimen okay any questions about that","4129":"okay and for the third diagnosis the high blood pressure you you do have a trend i've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure's been running a little bit high several other people have documented as well i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide it's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus it'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your in your feet i'm gon na have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at epic mychart and i'll get a reading of those as well and then what when you come back in two weeks we'll keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going and then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling i think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is a probably a good idea","4130":"yeah it can cause sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom a little bit more often in the evening but generally most people do n't have a whole lot of side effects i'll give you a handout of the side effects but sometimes you can have a cross reaction with some other medications like sulfa medications but generally most people tolerate this pretty well","4131":"alright any other questions we got","4132":"alright well great seeing you thanks for coming in today","4133":"hey sophia how are you doing today","4134":"okay do you remember what caused the pain initially","4135":"alright well can can you describe the pain for me","4136":"hmmm alright now tell me what what type of activities makes that pain worse","4137":"hmmm okay and does anything make the pain feel better","4138":"okay now you did mention earlier that you have tried some things in the past can you tell me what they were","4139":"okay and and tell me what is your day like","4140":"okay that's definitely a decrease in your mileage there where have you been running lately like do you run outside or on a treadmill or","4141":"yeah yeah there are some really nice senior routes here in boston is n't there like","4142":"so many knee places there's some right by the harbor that i've i've done some runs there before too it's pretty nice well i mean the boston marathon what can you say right","4143":"well okay well hopefully that we get you feeling better so you can start running again more than . five miles but tell me though have you noticed any swelling or redness in your knees","4144":"okay and have you ever injured your knees before","4145":"okay and it's just your arm right not not your knee","4146":"okay well alright well let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here let me look at your vital signs okay i reviewed your vitals they they overall they look good take a listen to your heart real quick alright and your heart exam i hear regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs and on your musculoskeletal exam i have seen you and walk around here and you do have normal gait alright now i'm gon na have you do some movements on your legs here okay","4147":"alright good your strength is three out of five for abduction of legs bilaterally and the remainder of muscle strength for your lower extremities are five out of five so that's good let me take a look at your knee now on your knee exam there is no overlying erythema that's redness or ecchymosis and that's bruising or any warmth of the skin appreciated there is no effusion let me go ahead and feel around here does that hurt right here how does that feel","4148":"sorry so there is tenderness to palpation of the bilateral retinacular retinaculum and there is positive patellar grind test alright and can you are you able to squat for me","4149":"okay alright so you're definitely having some knee pain with squatting and i'm just gon na maneuver your leg just a little bit here real quick okay so lachman anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray tests are all negative bilaterally so that's good there okay now your neuro exam patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical alright so now i did review the results of your x-ray and both of your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan so for your problem of bilateral knee pain based on what you told me your exam and reviewing your mri your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a very common condition that we see that causes knee pain especially in active young people so this condition has to do with the way your kneecap which is your patella how that moves along the groove of your thigh your thigh bone which is the femur now for the pain you may continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatory as needed to help with the pain but i'm also going to recommend physical therapy where where they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you may have so do you have any questions for me about that","4150":"well that is a goal of treatment and to get you back in running again now you will have to take an take it easy from running for now but we will continue to assess your progress with each visit okay","4151":"alright anything else","4152":"okay well very good well i will be following up with you soon and again just take it easy for now from the running okay","4153":"hey kyle so i see here on your chart that you've been having some back pain could you tell me like how you've been doing what's going on","4154":"okay and so you were like moving what what were you moving exactly when you say lifting","4155":"alright did we use proper lifting technique do you wonder","4156":"okay alright i'm sorry about that alright can you describe the pain for me","4157":"uh uh and does the pain like radiate anywhere","4158":"okay alright and how is positioning for you does any sitting in any particular position hurt more or hurt less","4159":"mm-hmm okay and then do you have any numbness or tingling associated with the pain","4160":"okay alright any loss of sensation","4161":"okay how yes sir okay how about any weakness","4162":"okay and i know this sounds like a weird question but i do need to know do you experience any loss of control of your bladder or bowels","4163":"alright this this is a no judgment zone i there i'm working through some things in my head to make sure that i give you the best care that we need right i'm making a plan as we move along you mentioned that the pain has been getting worse have you done anything or tried anything that's worked in the past","4164":"mm-hmm","4165":"okay alright and has anyone discussed the option of like just no has anyone discussed surgery with you","4166":"okay alright that's good so what is your like how what is your activity level right now that i know that you're you know an olympic weightlifter with books what else do you do to like exercise","4167":"okay alright and has this like pain started to like affect you like in your job or anything like that","4168":"alright so do you have any family members that have spine conditions","4169":"okay alright and then do you smoke","4170":"okay awesome alright so sorry one question did you do you have a history of playing sports","4171":"okay what did you play","4172":"okay what position","4173":"okay the people who hide in the back that's fine i was centered forward fine no baby do you have a team that you wrote for","4174":"they have the best colors not going to lie but i i grew up manu so sorry","4175":"thanks okay so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings just to have them recorded and if you have any questions please feel free to stop me and let me know okay","4176":"alright so looking at your vitals your blood pressure seems alright we are in like the one thirty over seventy range that's perfectly fine your respiratory rate i have you at an eighteen again pretty normal when i listen here to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops that means your heart sounds great on your respiratory exam your lungs sound clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal back exam as i'm looking here i do n't notice any overlying redness or bruising on the skin when i push here on the midline of your back does it hurt","4177":"okay so there is midline tenderness at the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness alright so are you able to bend forward","4178":"alright and are you able to bend backward","4179":"alright do either of those actions cause you pain","4180":"okay so pain with lumbar flexion and so i'm gon na have you lie down and we're gon na do i'm sorry okay and then i see that a supine straight leg test is positive alright so for your neurological exam you said that you are experiencing pain radiating down radiating down your left leg correct","4181":"alright when i touch are there any like decreased sensation","4182":"okay alright so patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical alright so i received before you came in here we got an mri and so in reviewing your results it does show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right neuroforaminal i do n't like this word neural foraminal stenosis what those complicated words is that i just said is that it seems that you have a a a herniated disk with nerve impingement so let's talk about my assessment and plan alright your symptoms are in line with a i'm sorry you have lumbar back pain at the l4 l5 disk space due to a herniated disk with radiculopathy this means that one of your disks that sits between your vertebrae like the bones in your spine is bulging out and the bulge is pinching on some nerves so that's why you are feeling that pain like radiating down your leg i'm gon na recommend something a spinal injection with a strong nsaid and called the i'm sorry and a corticosteroid i'm just gon na inject it into the lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of like an x-ray to localize the exact area of your pain this should help with the inflammation that's causing your pain i know that sounds a bit scary it this is a typical procedure that i do all the time it's in office and we can get you scheduled today if you would like so what questions do you have right now","4183":"yeah i think i have time in my schedule to get it done today just you know i'm here for you right now","4184":"there are sorry yeah you're right there are risks associated with this kind of injection just like any procedure but we aim to minimize them and my ma when she comes in we will give you some paperwork with explanations and any and hopefully answer most of the questions that you have if after reading that you have any more questions please feel free to stop us we want to make sure that you feel as comfortable as possible during this time","4185":"alright","4186":"anything else","4187":"doctor: alright","4188":"angela good to see you today so i'm writing here in my notes that you're you're coming in you had some left knee pain so how did you hurt your knee","4189":"mm-hmm","4190":"okay that that that that's not good how old are your niece","4191":"well that's good that you're trying to help her with the learning how to ride a bike","4192":"that sounds fun but i'm i'm sad as you hurt your knee doing it so for your knee pain are you are you able to bear weight on that leg the left leg","4193":"yeah yeah it's a definitely a good time to come see me so what part of your knee would you say it hurts","4194":"so okay so more in the medial aspect less on the lateral okay that makes sense and you said did you hear a pop when you when you twisted it","4195":"okay alright so how would you rate your pain with your knee out of out of one to ten","4196":"alright and have you taken anything for the pain","4197":"mm-hmm","4198":"yep yeah i'm i'm familiar","4199":"alright and has the has the ibuprofen been helping you at all","4200":"i mean i'm sorry the tylenol","4201":"okay yeah that yeah you ca n't take too much of that tylenol because it'll it'll mess up your liver definitely","4202":"alright so go ahead and do a quick exam on your knee here so when i press here does that hurt","4203":"okay alright i'm gon na do a couple of other other maneuvers here for your knee so on your left knee exam i do appreciate some edema you also have some effusion some fluid in the knee you have moderate range of motion so you're able to move it a little bit but not all the way i also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee even negative lachman's test and a negative valgus and varus test as well so all that to say is i do n't think anything is is torn in your knee based on the your physical exam so we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so everything is good there so let me talk to you little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay","4204":"alright so for your your left knee pain i believe you you have a mcl strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee i think when you were running with your knee she had somehow twisted it and so you strained that ligament there so for that what i want to do i'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an nsaid so i will put you on some tramadol you can take fifty milligrams you can do that twice a day and then you can take that tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain alright i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer leg knee immobilizer and you can wear that for the next week i just wan na keep the knee from moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here and i also want you to ice it and you can do that three or four times a day for twenty thirty minutes at a time and that should help some of that swelling as well and i i you know i know your niece is gon na be upset but i just do n't want you to be running probably for the next three weeks with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal so how does that sound","4205":"hmmm i think you'll be back to normal in about a month the strain does n't seem too bad but we just need to get you off of the knee so we can allow it to heal i mean once we do that you know along with you know the icing the mobilization and you taking the medication i think you'll be good to go in a month if you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse please feel free to call the office and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an mri to you know to see if it's anything worse but i do n't think it is but just let us know how you feel in a couple of days","4206":"alright any other questions","4207":"doctor: alright great thanks","4208":"hi diane , how are you ?","4209":"i'm doin' okay . so i know the nurse told you about dax and i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you okay ?","4210":"diane is a 28 year old female with a past medical history , significant for , depression and hypertension who presents for emergency room follow-up . so diane what's going on ? i heard that your- your blood pressure was really high in the emergency room . what happened ?","4211":"yeah , okay . yeah , i saw that the blood pressure was pretty high , like in , like , the , almost 200 .","4212":"did you have a headache ?","4213":"okay , all right . have your blood pressures been running high in the past ?","4214":"you're not taking your blood pressures , i take it-","4215":". when you're traveling ?","4216":"okay , but you did buy the cuff like we talked about in the past ?","4217":"okay , all right . and are you taking your medication , are you taking the lisinopril ?","4218":"okay , all right . um , so i think we had started you at a , kind of , a moderate dose , so we'll have to talk about that a little bit , okay ?","4219":"then in terms of your depression , how are you doing ? i know that we did n't start you on medication , since you're on a bunch of other medications . what- what are your strategies for dealing with that and how are you doing ?","4220":"okay , all right , great . and how is your support system ?","4221":"okay , well great . so i know you did a review of system sheet when you checked in and i know that you had the headache and the lightheadedness yesterday . do you have any other symptoms at this time , chest pain , shortness of breath , anything like that ?","4222":"okay , all right . well i want to go ahead and do a quick physical exam , okay ?","4223":"hey , dragon , show me the blood pressure . so , yeah , looking at your blood pressure today here in the office , it does look a little elevated still , so we'll have to talk about that . so i'm just gon na listen to your heart and your lungs and we'll go from there okay ?","4224":"so on physical examination , i- i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits in your neck . your heart on your heart exam , it does show that you have a slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur . your , there , your lung exam shows nice clear lungs bilaterally and you do have some trace pitting edema to your lower extremities bilaterally . so what that means is , you know , i- i think ultimately , uh , you know we just need to get your blood pressure under better control , okay ?","4225":"um , uh , let me just go ahead , i want to take a look at some of your results , okay ?","4226":"hey , dragon , show me the ecg . yeah , so in reviewing the results of your ekg , it looks the same as last year . um , you do have just blood , those changes from your chronic high blood pressure that we'll address , okay ? hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram . and this is just the echocardiogram from just a few months ago that just , you know , show that you have that slightly leaky heart valve , nothing to do for it , and that the heart murmur is stable , okay ?","4227":"so let's just talk a little bit about , you know , my assessment and my plan for you . so , for your first problem , your high blood pressure , it's not controlled at this time , so i want to go ahead and increase the lisinopril to 40 milligrams once a day . i want you to continue to check your blood pressures and report them to me through the patient portal and we'll have to make adjustments if necessary and maybe have to add a second agent , okay ?","4228":"and then for your second problem , uh , i want , you know , for your depression , i do n't think that we need to start you on any medication , it sounds like you're doing really well from that standpoint , but you know that you can contact me if you , if you need anything , okay ?","4229":"do you have any questions ?","4230":"okay , all right , well it's good to see you .","4231":"doctor: hey , dragon , finalize the note .","4232":"hi alan , how are you ?","4233":"good to see you as well . are you ready to get started ?","4234":"so , alan is a 61-year-old male , here with complaints of shortness of breath . so alan , what's going on ?","4235":"okay , and have you had any other symptoms ? have you had any fever-","4236":". chest pain ?","4237":"okay , um , and anyone else sick in your , in your family ?","4238":"okay , and any cough ?","4239":"okay , all right . um , and any other symptoms ? i know you went through the review of symptoms-","4240":". with the nurse but any nausea or vomiting or abdominal pain ?","4241":"okay . all right . well , i know that i've treated you for migraines in the past . how are you doing with those ?","4242":"okay . all right . and i think we had you on imitrex for that . have you-","4243":"all right . and then your reflux , how are you doing with that ?","4244":"okay and everything's working out well with the protonix ?","4245":"okay . and then i know you had the cataract surgery about three months ago , your vision is okay ?","4246":"okay , great . all right , well , we're gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam . i wan na see your vital signs first .","4247":"hey dragon , show me the vital signs . okay , so looking here , everything looks quite good . your oxygenation is perfect , which is wonderful . let me just take a listen . deep breath . another one . good . so , on your physical exam , your neck is nice and supple . i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distension . your heart is in a regular rhythm , i do n't hear any murmur . your lungs do have a slight wheeze , expiratory wheeze , bilaterally . i can hear it every time you breathe and i see trace lower extremity edema in your lower extremities .","4248":"you know , you , uh , i'm not quite sure yet but we're gon na review some of your results . hey dragon , show me the chest x-ray . so looking here , this is a very normal chest x-ray . um , i do n't see any pulmonary edema , there's no pneumonia , so we're viewing your chest x-ray as , it's a norm- it's normal .","4249":"so , let's look at your pulmonary function test . hey dragon , show me your , the pfts . and looking here again , these look quite good , i'm , i'm quite encouraged by that . that's , that's normal pulmonary function tests . hey dragon , show me the labs . and all of your labs here look quite good here as well so , i- i- i'm very pleased . so , right now my impression of you is that you may have had an asthma exacerbation from exercising and with the allergies , so at this point in time i'd like to go ahead and prescribe you some albuterol inhaler .","4250":"two puffs every four hours as needed for wheezing or for shortness of breath . and , i'd like to go ahead and order a pulmonary referral for you , okay . do you have any questions about that ?","4251":"hey dragon , order a pulmonary referral . hey dragon , order albuterol inhaler , two puffs every four hours , as needed for shortness of breath . and then i think from your reflux standpoint , everything seems stable and your migraines , i think that we should just continue on with the imitrex , as needed . does that sound good to you ?","4252":"i wan na see you in a couple weeks and if you have this shortness of breath again , i want you to call me right away , okay ?","4253":"all right . good to see you .","4254":"doctor: hey dragon , finalize the note .","4255":"hi joyce , how are you ?","4256":"i'm doing well . so , i know the nurse told you about dax . i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you when we get started , okay ?","4257":"all right . so , joyce is a 50 year old female with a past medical history significant for copd , congestive heart failure who presents for follow-up to an abnormal lab finding . so , joyce , i , i got the results of your lab , uh , your labs . your hemoglobin was low . uh , so , i asked them to schedule a follow-up appointment with me . so , how are you feeling ?","4258":"okay . all right . um , now , have you had ... have you noticed any blood in your stools at all ?","4259":"okay . and are your stools , like , dark or charry or black looking ?","4260":"okay . and are you spotting a lot with your periods ?","4261":"okay . all right . um , and do you have any other ... i know that you are endorsing this fatigue and you feel kind of dizzy and that type of thing . do you have any other symptoms like chest pain , shortness of breath , fever , chills , body aches , anything ?","4262":"okay . any weight loss ?","4263":"okay . all right . well , let me ask you a little bit about how's the , the copd doing . i , i know that , you know , you've stopped smoking several years ago , but , you know , you still have that em- those emphysema changes on your chest x-ray . so , how are you doing with that ? how's your breathing ?","4264":"okay . all right . and then from a congestive heart failure standpoint , are you watching your diet , you're watching your salt intake ?","4265":"um , so , french fries are one of my favorite foods , that and fried chicken , so- i give you a lot of credit for staying away from french fries .","4266":"um , okay . so , you ... so , no swelling in your legs or any- anything like that .","4267":"okay . and you feel like you have a good support system ?","4268":"okay . all right . good . i'm glad to hear that . uh , so , let's go ahead . i wan na just do a quick physical exam , okay ?","4269":"hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . all right . well , your vital signs here in the office look good , so , i'm , i'm really happy to see that with the abnormal hemoglobin that we saw . um , i'm gon na just listen to your heart and lungs and press on your belly a little bit and i'll let you know if i find anything , okay ?","4270":"all right . okay . all right . so , on physical exam , you know , i , i do n't appreciate anything cervical lymphadenopathy . your heart sounds really good , but i do hear a , a slight two out of six systolic heart , uh , murmur , um , systolic ejection murmur on your heart exam . your lungs sound clear . your abdomen ... you know , you did have a little tenderness to palpation in your right lower quadrant on your abdominal exam , uh , but i do n't appreciate any lower extremity edema . so , all that means it that we , you know , we hear that heart murmur , which we heard in the past , um , and your belly had some tenderness , so we'll have to talk about that a little bit , uh , going forward , okay ?","4271":"let's look at some of your results , okay ?","4272":"hey , dragon , show me the hemoglobin . so , here , looking at this , you know , your hemoglobin level is 8.2. somebody like you should have a hemoglobin o- of about 13 , 14 , okay ?","4273":"so , we need to investigate why it's low . hey , dragon , show me the anemia labs . okay . so , looking here at your labs , uh , everything looks good from , from this standpoint . i think some of your anemia labs are still pending at this time that's part of the workup .","4274":"so , let's go over a little bit about the assessment and plan for you . so , you know , your main problem , this abnormal lab , this low hemoglobin that we found , so , you're anemic and we nee- ... you know , i'm waiting for those anemia labs to come back to find out exactly , you know , what type of anemia you have . i'd like to go ahead and schedule you for an endoscopy a- and a colonoscopy just to make sure that you're not bleeding from your , inside your belly , okay ? um , and i'm ... i'll be in touch when those labs come back to see what further workup we need to do , okay ?","4275":"for your next problem , the copd , i think you're doing great . you know , i , i do n't think that you , uh , need any further referrals at this time for that . i would just continue staying away from smoking . it does n't sound to be like you need any inhalers at this time . uh , for your third problem , your congestive heart failure , you know , i wan na continue you on the toprol , continue you on the lisinopril and we'll continue you on your current diuretic dosing of 20 , lasix 20 milligrams a day . i'm gon na go ahead and order that referral to g- to gastroenterology . they're the ones who will do the endoscopy and the colonoscopy , okay ?","4276":"hey , dragon , order the referral to gastroenterology . so , i'll be in touch . i'm gon na stay in close contact with you over the next week or so and , uh , we'll get this all sorted out , okay ?","4277":"all right . take care , joyce .","4278":"doctor: hey , dragon , finalize the note .","4279":"hi evelyn , how are you ?","4280":"i'm good . it's good to see you .","4281":"so i know the nurse told you a little bit about dax . i'm gon na tell dax about you , okay ?","4282":"so evelyn is a 56-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease , prior carpal tunnel release , and a herniated disc who presents for her annual exam . so evelyn it's been a little while since i've seen you , how have you been doing over the last year ?","4283":"okay , yeah , i know that we have done a steroid injection for that , uh , a couple of month- , uh , several months ago , so that's- that's doing well ?","4284":"okay , i'm glad to hear that . and then , how about your carpal tunnel issues , you had that fixed a couple of years ago , so are you having any recurrent issues , or you good , you back to work ?","4285":"all right , so no numbing and tingling in your hands ?","4286":"okay , that's good . and then , you know , i know that you've had , uh , prior stenting in the past for your- for your heart , and your heart vessels .","4287":"how are you doing from that standpoint ? have you had any chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting ?","4288":"okay , does the chest pain happen when you walk ?","4289":"okay , and does it- does it go away if you- if you rest ?","4290":"okay , all right . do you ever get it just sitting there at rest ?","4291":"okay , all right . okay , and- and can you describe it ?","4292":"okay , and where exactly is it located in your chest ?","4293":"okay . and how often are you getting it ?","4294":"okay , all right . well i'm glad that you talked about that with me today , um , i know the nurse did a review of systems sheet with you , and , you know , you're obviously endorsing this- this chest pressure . um , have you had any other symptoms , i know the- the other ones that you have n't had , but any lower extremity edema , or muscle aches , or fever chills ?","4295":"okay , so you're endorsing some nasal congestion ?","4296":"all right , well let's go ahead and we'll do a physical exam , okay ?","4297":"hey dragon ? show me the vital signs . so here your vital signs look really good , i'm- i'm happy to see that your blood pressure is under- under good control , and your oxygenation is fine , so i'm just gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , and i'll let you know if i find anything , okay ?","4298":"okay , so in physical exam your heart has a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard before . your lungs are nice and clear , uh , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits , and- and you have no lower extremity edema , you have healed , uh , surgical scars on your- on your , uh , right wrist . um , so let's go ahead , i wan na look at some of your results , okay ?","4299":"hey dragon , show me the echocardiogram ? so this is the echocardiogram from last year , you know , you did have a slightly low pumping function of your heart at 45 % , but , uh , i- , you know , i suspected that will improve over time , and you did have some slight , what we call , mitral regurgitation , that's just a leaky heart valve , and that's that murmur that i heard . hey dragon , show me the ecg ? and here , you know , in reviewing your results of your e- ecg , you know , it looks stable , it just kinda reflects your prior coronary artery disease . there's no new changes , which is good , so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you . so , from your first problem , you know , your carpal tunnel release , i do n't think that we need to anything further about that , 'cause you seem to be doing really well , you're back at work , if you have any recurring symptoms , just let me know , and we can take it from there . for your next problem , your herniated disc , that also sounds like your doing really well , i do n't think that we need to refer you for any further steroid injection , or physical therapy at this time . so , if you have recurrent symptoms , i want you to let me know . and finally , your last problem , the most concerning problem to me is your known coronary artery disease , and this recurrent chest pain you have . so , i wan na go ahead and continue you on your asprin , and your toprol , okay ? i wan na go ahead and order a stress test for you to see if you have more blockages that could be causing this chest discomfort , okay ?","4300":"and i'm gon na go ahead and get a lipid panel and , uh , start you on crestor 20 mg , once a day , okay ?","4301":"hey dragon , order a cardiac stress test . do you have any questions ?","4302":"okay , all right . hey dragon , finalize the note . so , it was good to see you , the nurse will come in , she'll help you get your scheduled for all of those things , and i'll be in touch , okay ?","4303":"doctor: take care .","4304":"morning roy , how are you doing ?","4305":"so , my nurse told you a little bit about dax ? so , if you do n't mind , i'm going to tell dax a little bit about you today .","4306":"great , great . so , roy is a 50-year-old male patient who comes in with a history of depression , you had some , um , high blood pressure and some hypertension . so , tell me how have you been doing?","4307":"um , any changes in , um , weight gain or anything like that ?","4308":"okay . okay . gotcha , gotcha .","4309":"out the window . okay . and , um , now i know you've had a history of depression . you're on zoloft , uh , 50 milligrams a day . have you been doing okay with that ?","4310":"okay . uh , sleeping okay at night ?","4311":"occasionally ?","4312":"uh , no feelings of , uh , you want to hurt yourself or anybody ?","4313":"okay , good , good . and , um , your high blood pressure , um , that's been under relatively good control recently . have you found that ? your blood pressures have been okay ?","4314":"okay , gotcha . gotcha . okay . so , um , if you do n't mind , i'm going to do a quick exam . okay ?","4315":"okay . so , um , on my physical exam , your lungs are clear . your heart is , is regular . you do have a grade two systolic ejection murmur . we've had that before , so nothing new-","4316":". there . um , and not clinically relevant at all . um , your extremities are normal , no edema . um , you have put on a c- a , a little bit of weight .","4317":"i want you to get back on that diet .","4318":"because that's the key . right ?","4319":"as far as your high blood pressure , not going to change anything there . okay ? we'll just leave you on your lisinopril 5 milligrams a day , that's good .","4320":"that's also good for your kidneys , so everything , everything good ... is good there . your third problem is your depression . been a rough year . some of that's just normal reactive stuff . so i think we'll just keep you where you are at . not going to change the zoloft . do you need a refill on your zoloft ?","4321":"okay . hey dragon , order a zoloft 50 milligrams daily . we'll get that refilled for you . okay ? so , um , i'd like to see you back in about a month , an- and then in about , uh , three months","4322":"a1c , if everything's getting back on track . okay ? anything else i can do for you today ?","4323":"doctor: okay . come with me , we'll get you checked out . hey dragon , finalize the note .","4324":"hi logan , how are you

history significant for coronary artery bypass grafting , hyperlipidemia , and ocd , who presents with an upper respiratory infection . so , logan , what's going on ?","4327":"okay . um , and , and

anything like that ?","4335":"okay . and i know you had the , uh , bypass grafting last year . you're doing okay ?","4336":"no chest pain ?","4337":"okay . all right . and you're able to exercise ?","4338":"okay . before you got sick .","4339":"okay . all right . well , let's go ahead , i want to do a quick physical exam . okay ?","4340":"hey dragon , show me the vital signs . so , here it ... your vital signs look great . your oxygenation is 96 % . so that's very good . okay ? uh , i'm just going to check out your heart and lungs , and i'll let you know what i find . okay ?","4341":"okay . so on exam , you do have some cervical lymphadenopathy . and your lungs have bilateral ronchi in them , um , and some wheezing . so , what that means is , you know , you have a little infection . you probably have a little bit of a cold , and you have some lymph nodes that are swollen , and some congestion in your lungs , like you said . let's go ahead and take a look at some of your results . okay ?","4342":"hey dragon , show me the lipid panel . so your cholesterol , for the most part , is really good . i think you're doing a good job . uh , i do n't think you have to make any changes right now . um , hey dragon , show me the covid test . turns out you're positive for ... for covid . so the results of your po- your covid test are positive .","4343":"so , i know you were vaccinated . you probably have a , a , a very , um , low-level positivity . so let's talk about that . so for your first problem , uh , is your covid infection . and i think the vaccine has helped you . it seems to be very mild at this time . your oxygenation is really good . i want you to quarantine for t- for 10 days , so , uh , try to avoid your other household family members . okay ?","4344":"and you're going to have to take off work . um , if your symptoms worsen , i want you to call me .","4345":"it's just supportive management . uh , for your next problem , your high cholesterol , let's continue you on the crestor 20 milligrams a day , and continue to watch your ja- your , your diet and i- then i'll go ahead and order another lipid panel for six months . and , from a coronary artery bypass grafting standpoint , your coronary artery disease seems under control . you're exercising . you do n't have any chest pain . we'll do a stress test in six months as well .","4346":"okay ? any

are you doing with your crestor ? any problems with that ?","4361":"okay . and any chest pain or shortness of breath ?","4362":"no ? okay . okay . all right , and in terms of your lupus , we have , you know , this is something that was kinda back in the , in the background for you , and we have n't had to do a whole lot . you know , your kidney function's been really good . um , any , any issues as far as you know ?","4363":"okay . i think we , we might have to look into it a little bit further with this knee pain that you're having .","4364":"but i wan na go ahead and , um ... you know , i know that the nurse did a review of system sheet and we just covered a lot here .","4365":"any other symptoms , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting ?","4366":"no , just the knee pain ?","4367":"okay .

your lungs sound nice and clear . and on your knee exam , i do appreciate , you know , some bilateral , uh , edema and some slight erythema , there is a slight effusion present on the right knee . does that hurt ?","4373":"all right , so pain to palpation of the right knee . um , and decreased range of motion of the knees bilaterally . so i just wan na look at some of your results , okay ?","4374":"hey , dragon . show me the right knee x-ray . so this is an x-ray of your right knee and in reviewing the results of that , everything looks fine , there's no boney abnormality , there's no fracture , which is not surprising , based on the history , okay ?","4375":"hey , dragon . show me the ekg . and this is your most recent ekg which we did before you came in , and that all looks really good . so , um , so no concerns from a heart standpoint . so let's talk a little bit about , you know , my assessment and my plan for you .","4376":"so for your first problem , your , your knee pain , you know , i'm concerned that it might be from , you know , a flareup of your lupus , so i wan na go ahead and order and autoimmune panel to kinda see where we stand , okay ?","4377":"hey , dragon . order an autoimmune panel . for your next problem , the coronary artery disease , i think you're doing really well , your ekg looks good , your vital signs look good .","4378":"i'm gon na go

any chest pain , shortness of breath ? any nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea ?","4387":"we've been , kind of , checking on this for a while and you've been on metformin . we actually increased your dose

all right . um , hey , dragon , show me the hemoglobin a1c . so in reviewing your , that's the lab that we checked after when i saw before i walked in . it says 8.1 , which is elevated , so i think we need to do a maybe a better job with adjusting your medication . how are you doing with your diet for your diabetes ?","4391":"okay . and , uh , have you had any , uh , any other , are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or your fasting blood sugars ?","4392":"okay . all right . how are you doing with your high blood pressure ?","4393":"okay , great . and how's your knee doing that's

legs or extremities right now . so let's talk about some of the issues today . all right . for the first issue , for the diabetes , since your hemoglobin a1c is is elevated , uh , and you're already on 1,000 milligrams of metformin , i think we should add , uh , jardiance , uh , 10 milligrams a day . uh , so that's a new medication . we'll start that . i do want you to , uh follow your diet pretty , uh , aggressively . i wan na see if we can get that hemoglobin a1c down the next time . i'm also gon na add some labs today to see what that , to see a lipid panel and some other blood work .

right . for the high blood pressure , i think you're doing great . you're on lisinopril for that , so i think that we should continue that . uh , we'll re-check it again next time and you are monitoring that at home , correct ?","4400":"okay , great . and for the knee , i think you're doing great with that . you know , continue with your physical exercise , with your physical therapy , uh

heart exam i do appreciate a slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base , which we've heard in the past .","4447":"your lungs are nice and clear and you do have uh one plus non-pitting edema bilaterally in your lower extremities . so what does all that mean ? it just means i heard a little sound in your heart , which you know is n't anything clinically significant . we had looked into that last year .","4448":"you do have a little swelling in your legs but that might just be from your your diet recently , okay .","4449":"i wan na just take a look at some of your results . hey dragon , show me the ekg . so i just had the nurse do an ekg on you before you came in just to make sure we were n't missing anything . you're in your 60's we have some risk factors .

elevated . it's at eight . i'd like to see it closer to six . now some of them might be having to do with the holidays that type of thing but i still think that we need to get that under better control .","4451":"so lets talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem of your depression i'd like to just go ahead and refer you to uh psychiatry not for

let's do my review of systems . you're not having any headaches or dizziness ?","4483":"good , good . and the vision is better with the cataract surgery ? that's been good ?","4484":"hmm , sometimes they can go in and clean up the eye with laser , but we'll see what they say .","4485":"okay . no shortness of breath or coughing ?","4486":"what does it look like when it comes up ?","4487":"no fever , chills , no shortness of breath ?","4488":"okay . no chest pains or pressure or tightness ?","4489":"nausea , vomiting , gi symptoms ?","4490":"okay . peeing okay ?","4491":"slower stream but stable ?","4492":"mm-hmm . how many times do you have to get up at night ?","4493":"okay . all right , let's have a look at you .","4494":"physical exam : carotids are normal , pulse is no buits . heart exam : rhythm is regular , normal rate , s1 and s2 are crisp . i do not hear any murmurs today , okay . have you lean forward for me . take some deep breaths , in and out . okay , lungs are clear . i do n't hear any rasps or wheezing today .","4495":"you cleared out the lungs ? all right , let me take a look at your feet .","4496":"okay . extremities are without edema . pulses are palpable on the dorsalis pedis posterial tibial . she has thickened nails .","4497":"yeah . mildly dry skin , no skin breakdown . l- let me know if you can feel this .","4498":"mildly decreased sensation in the tips of the first and second toes . okay , we're done with your exam .","4499":"okay . so again , try to keep the feet moisturized .","4500":"you do have a little bit of periphe- peripheral neuropathy . um , there is a medication we can use if they get really bad , but you're already on so many medications .","4501":"that sounds good . so for now , your sugars , we're gon na check your ... we're going to recheck your blood work today , but the sugars last time we checked , the a1c , your blood sugar average was above nine . i really want you to increase the glimepiride . so the ones you have at home , the two milligram , take two of them twice a day .","4502":"okay . watch for low sugars , weak , shaky , sweaty . if that happens , let us know , and i do n't expect it to .","4503":"okay . the new prescription that i'm going to write is gon na be for the , uh , four milligram pill . so when you get the new one , just one pill twice a day . also , continue the metformin , okay ? blood pressure , when i rechecked it , i got 140 over 60 s- so the numbers at home are better , so we're gon na continue the combination of medications . we'll check kidney function today . for your cholesterol though , you're on the high dose of atorvastatin or lipitor to protect the arteries , so we really wan na keep you on that .","4504":"i want you to quit smoking , but we've had this battle before .","4505":"hmm . and then , we will leave everything else the same . we'll get the labs today and we'll see you back here in four months . sound good ?","4506":"great . have a good day , ma'am . take care of yourself .","4507":"patient mrn : abc123 . date of birth : january 1st , 1960 . patient is a 60 year old , right-handed male , referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling . hello , mr. cook . how are you doing this morning ?","4508":"so it's in both of your hands ?","4509":"and you still wear the splint only on the right wrist ?","4510":"and where would you say the tingling and numbness is ?","4511":"i see . so on the right side , you're pointing from the middle and ring finger , all the way up the forearm . and on the left , the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger . and is there any pain or just tingling and numbness ?","4512":"and when do you feel these symptoms ?","4513":"okay . and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ?","4514":"and are you still on the coreg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety ?","4515":"and no history of thyroid issues , correct ?","4516":"all right , thank you , mr. cook . okay , first , we'll go over your review of systems . correct me if i'm wrong in any of this . constitutional , you have fatigue and weight gain ; gi , you have excessive appetite and bloating ; eyes have floaters ; cardiovascular shows shortness of breath and leg swelling ; endocrine , you're always hungry ; skin , you have some nail bed changes , dryness , itching ; musculoskeletal , you have gout and muscle pain . and the remainder of the review of systems is negative .","4517":"all right , we're going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination . let's look at the right hand first . can you feel this ?","4518":"sensation is normal , except pin prick sensation diminished in third and fourth fingers on the right . and how about on the left ?","4519":"sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left okay , let's test your reflexes now . reflexes are 1+ and symmetric ; 2+ knees ; toes are downgoing bilaterally . all right , i'm going to tap on your right wrist . do you feel anything ?","4520":"and how about the left side ?","4521":"tinel sign positive at both wrists and both elbows . rest of exam is normal . all right , so what i am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or , potentially , this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome . however , your symptom presentation suggests car- bilateral carpal syndrome , as the nerve in your wrists are aggravated by your past trauma . this is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me .","4522":"first , i want to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from . we'll need to schedule you for a nerve test , which is called an emg test . they will measure the responsiveness of your nerves to truly pinpoint where you are having your issues .","4523":"great . after the tests are complete , you can return here for a follow-up visit . if you're still having symptoms , we can consider a referral to our hand clinic , possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release se- surgery . you could also refer ... we could also refer you to an orthopedist for the same treatment .","4524":"all right , keep wearing your splints , and i will see you after those studies .","4525":"patient shirley taylor . date of birth 5\/4\/1961 . mrn 0000123 . patient is a 60 year old right-handed female new patient referred by dr. jacob ward for evaluation of bilateral

ms. taylor . how are you doing this morning ?","4526":"so , in both of your hands ?","4527":"are you still wearing the splint only on your right wrist ?","4528":"okay . and where exactly on the right side would you say the tingling and numbness is ?","4529":"all right . and , um , is there is pain or , or just tingling and numbness ?","4530":"what kind of activities ?","4531":"okay . and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ?","4532":"okay . looks like your medical history is notable for chronic kidney disease , gout , hypertension , anxiety , gerd , and diabetes .","4533":"okay . good . and are you still on the carvedilol 25 milligrams two times a day for hypertension and lexapro 10 milligrams a day for anxiety ? looks like your allergic to sulfa drugs as well . is that correct ?","4534":"and no history of thyroid issues , right ?","4535":"all right . thank you ms. taylor . i'll be right back for your exam . i want to look up that medication you mentioned for your nerve pain .","4536":"doctor: review of systems , please make the following changes . uh , constitutional , patient reports fatigue and weight gain . gi , um , excessive appetite and bloating . eyes , floaters . uh , cardiovascular , shortness of breath and leg swelling . endocrine , positive diabetes , always hungry . skin , nail bed trenches , dryness , itching . musculoskeletal , gout , muscle pain . neurological , parasthesia , bilateral hands . um , please use the default normal neuro-physical exam with the following changes . sensations normal except pin prick sensation diminished in the third and forth fingers on the right . and the fourth and fifth fingers on the left . reflexes are one plus and symmetric , two plus knees , toes are down going bilaterally , tinel's sign positive at both wrists and both elbows . let's move onto assessment and plan , bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome , question of bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome . i discussed my impression with the patient , i will schedule her for emg , ncv . if her symptoms do not resolve , we can consider hand clinic referral for possible symptomatic injections or carpal tunnel release surgery although she can pursue these uh , through her current orthopedist . i encouraged her to wear her splints , returned for emg , ncv . end of note .","4537":"michelle king , date of birth 01\/05\/1986 , mrnq27631 . new patient visit for acid reflux . past medical history of anxiety and seasonal allergies . hello , are you mrs. king ?","4538":"i'm dr. phillips . very nice to meet you .","4539":"how can i help you today ?","4540":"okay . can you tell me more about it ?","4541":"what do you feel ?","4542":"in your chest ?","4543":"in your throat and chest . all right . any difficulty with swallowing ? feels like food or liquids kinda get stuck ?","4544":"okay . that's good . any abdominal pain ?","4545":"nausea or vomiting , changes in bowel movements ?","4546":"constipation , diarrhea , rectal bleeding ?","4547":"okay . very good . and how long have you had this problem ?","4548":"okay . and how long have you been on the omeprazole ?","4549":"okay . do you find that it's done anything for you in the past ?","4550":"are there any things that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint , like food choices or stress ?","4551":"okay . what things bother you ?","4552":"we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that , even sodas . um , even just the carbonation can cause that . how about tomato-based products or citrus products ?","4553":"okay . it's reassuring that you are n't having any difficulty swallowing , though . how's your weight been ? pretty stable ?","4554":"what do you do for work ?","4555":"okay . and any family history of gi issues ?","4556":"on your mom or dad's side ?","4557":"okay . have you ever had an upper endoscopy ?","4558":"but not in the last 10 years ?","4559":"have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole ?","4560":"okay . have a seat here , and let me listen to your heart and lungs , and then we can talk about a plan for you .","4561":"so normal physical exam per my new patient template , except for well-healed abdominal surgical scars noted . what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from ?","4562":"hm , gotcha . okay . so let's talk about what you have going on . from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several-year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux . and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole , 40 milligrams twice daily . you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ?","4563":"and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated bev- beverages , citrus , and tomato-based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet . so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd , even though you're taking the ppi .","4564":"great . so stress is another trigger that we need to address . high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms .","4565":"so working on that may help with your gerd . additionally , we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole . if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium .","4566":"perfect . i will send a prescription for nexium 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file . i'll also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd , or upper endoscopy , to look for potential causes of the gerd . we'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth , down your throat , through your stomach , and end in the small intestines . we'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything .","4567":"yeah . you can get scheduled at checkout desk . i'll have you follow up with me in the office for the egd so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary , stress , and medication changes . how does all of that sound ?","4568":"doctor: perfect . i will walk you to the checkout desk . be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes or if you have problems before your egd and follow-up appointment . please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan . i suspect that she likely has gerd with underlying functional etiology as well . reassuringly , she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia . if her egd is normal and her symptoms pers- persist despite a trial of nexium , we can consider a trial of protonix and obtain a ph-impedance study . this will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity .","4569":". next patient is michelle king . date of birth : 05\/07\/1982 . please use toc template . she was admitted to district regional hospital on 06\/29\/2021 , and was discharged on 07\/02\/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to , uh , prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ?","4570":"i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ?","4571":"it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on .","4572":"okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high .","4573":"typically , it does n't .","4574":"but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive .","4575":"and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ...","4576":"but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed .","4577":"uh , they did n't do a ct scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ?","4578":"mm-hmm .","4579":"yeah , it was good that you went in .","4580":"well , maybe that's all it was .","4581":"so you're doing good otherwise ?","4582":"good . let me take a quick listen to you .","4583":"all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ?","4584":"great . so here are my thoughts .","4585":"you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ?","4586":"okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues .","4587":"i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while .","4588":"and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ?","4589":"great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol .","4590":"and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels .","4591":"i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see .","4592":"have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing .","4593":"got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works .","4594":"all right . so we have our plan . any questions ?","4595":"sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ?","4596":"so what are your concerns about the vaccine ?","4597":"correct , we do n't .","4598":"right .","4599":"well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you .","4600":"and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay .","4601":"but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid .","4602":"i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that .","4603":"yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ?","4604":"right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint .","4605":"mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated .","4606":"so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country .","4607":"the er is full of these vaccines .","4608":"so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion .","4609":"yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly .","4610":"so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency .","4611":"but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ?","4612":"all right . anything else we can discuss today ?","4613":"you're welcome . so we'll see you in two to three weeks . have a good rest of your day .","4614":"doctor: next line heading will be \" acute to chronic constipation \" . she believes her hospitalization was more likely due to her dysreflexia , from her quadriplegia that typically occurs . she did have a lot of vital signs changes , including blood pressure fluctuations . the patient feels like she has a good bowel regimen , including taking the miralax regularly as a primary treatment for constipation issues as well as lactulose for severe constipation . she feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection and was just related to her constipation . however , we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis . i would recommend just in the next three or four weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs , and we'll repeat the cbc just to make sure her white blood cells tend downward . uh , next line and heading will be \" quadriplegia \" . um , next line and heading will be \" covid vaccine status \" . again , she's hesitant . we had a good discussion , and i recommended that the only true preventative mechanism for covid is the vaccine . i do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off . i would be concerned if she does n't get the vaccine and i would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status . she does not want to get covid . however , she needs to make these decisions . she is somewhat homeopathic .","4615":"all right . this is matthew rogers . date of birth 5\/24\/2007 . i would like to use the acne follow-up template for him . he is here today for an acne follow-up . at the last visit on 3\/3\/21 he was prescribed the following : clindamycin lotion , uh , trent- tretinoin cream , 4-5 % benzoyl peroxide wash for f-face and 5-10 % for chest and back . so we're going to enter the room : hi there , how are y'all today ?","4616":"i'm good , thank you . uh , acne doing better ?","4617":"excellence , excellent . tell me , uh , what did you do for your skin this morning ?","4618":"perfect . uh , what did you do last night ?","4619":"all right , all right , now have you had any redness , peeling , dryness , or irritation with the use of these medications at all ?","4620":"excellent , excellent . and , uh , washing your chest and back with the higher strength benzoyl peroxide wash , is that right ?","4621":"okay . um , are your chest and back doing okay ?","4622":"fair enough . that's all right . um , if it bothers you , that's what , uh , that's why i recommended last time","4623":"um , so as we move into the summer it may be something that you are more interested in pursuing doing that , uh , but if you feel like the acne on your face ... do you feel like the acne on your face is improving ?","4624":"all right , good . good . uh , go ahead and bring your mask down . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . that looks good !","4625":"definitely . uh , this is one of the fun parts of covid for me . it's like the mask comes down for my acne patients and it's like a big reveal . this lo- this looks a lot better , like a lot better . uh , i'm just going to take a look at your back and chest real quick . um , i would n't recommend making any changes to what you're doing . uh , i'm happy with how things are going . are you- are you happy with how things are going ?","4626":"all right , yeah . if that little bit bothers you , i would use a 5-10 % benzoyl peroxide base . i think that ... i think that what i have using on your face is a 4-5 % . um , usually the back and chest can handle a little , uh , a little something stronger . um , that's the only thing i would think about changing , otherwise it think this looks great .","4627":"all right , uh , do you have any questions for me ?","4628":"uh , well you want me to write that down for you on your , uh , checkout sheet ?","4629":"uh , the one i recommend for the chest and back is the , the PanOxyl 10 % . uh , we actually have samples of it and coupons . so i can send you home with those .","4630":"all right , um , so i'm going ahead and tee up a one year prescription for you because at this point i'll want to see you once a year . i want to make sure that you have enough of your medicines , um , and these are going to walgreens on broad ?","4631":"okay . um , all right . so the tretinoin , uh , usually lasts patients a couple of months . you probably have n't refilled that , right ?","4632":"okay . okay . so i'm going to go ahead and send in a new refill for the clindamycin with 11 refills . and then the tretinoin cream with three refills . uh , that's usually about enough for a year . uh , if you run out though , just let us know . i'm happy to send more . uh , i just need to see you back once a year for your medicine . all right ? your acne printout with steps will be at your checkout sheet . and then here are your samples and coupons .","4633":"doctor: um , as far as the physical exam . scattered inflammatory papules and pustules across the upper back and posterior shoulders . there are less than 5 inflammatory papules on the forehead , cheeks , and chin . acne vulgaris is improved and well controlled on the face , but there is a mild flare on the back . recommend continuing current treatment plan for the face and initiation treatment with PanOxyl 10 % foaming wash to the back in the shower daily .","4634":"stephanie morales , medical

you ?","4637":"good . any problems ?","4638":"okay . that area of numbness will get smaller as the nerves that innervate the skin across the knee heal .","4639":"so lem me take a look at your right knee .","4640":"all right , and relax for me . good . all right , and bend . good . that looks good . um , the incision looks nice .","4641":"let's look at your x-rays . uh , they look good . so here's what you got going on in there . uh , it looks good . everything's lined up nicely . um , that's looking at it from the front . and this is looking at it from the side . and then this was underneath your kneecap , but we did n't do anything there . but things looks great .","4642":"yeah , you know , you're still early in your recovery , so i expect you to get even better than what you are now . um , so keep doing your pt to work on your strength , range of motion , and endurance .","4643":"you're probably still gon na have aches and pains occasionally . i usually tell people it's two or three months before you feel like you're back to yourself again , so you're doing really well .","4644":"yeah , let's plan to talk again in six weeks . so if you stop at the desk on your way out today , they're going to get you set up for a telemedicine visit . and that visit'll just be to check in and see how you're doing and make sure things are progressing okay .","4645":"okay . i , i do n't want you lifting greater than five or 10 pounds , and no standing or sitting longer than a half an hour . uh , usually that means you ca n't do a ups job .","4646":"sure . i'll have my nurse anna give it to you .","4647":"okay , so we'll talk again in six weeks , and we can discuss your job again at that time .","4648":"yeah , those , um , are the types of , of jobs that take a good three months until you're kind of ready to get back to doing that kind of labor-intensive work .","4649":"uh , we have plenty of data that says normal reflex time is returned at six weeks , and then your return to driving is determined by when you're ready and feel safe to be driving .","4650":"yeah . so hang tight . anna will bring that note back in to you , and we'll talk in six weeks .","4651":"uh , but keep working hard on , on pt in the meantime though .","4652":"all right , have a good rest of your day .","4653":"doctor: okay , this is a six-week post-op meeting exam for her . her gait was antalgic with a slight limp and decreased velocity . she's not using an assistive device . right knee focused exam has a healed surgical scar , mild swelling , tenderness- tenderness . . on the area of the incision . range of motion is zero to 120 degrees . everything else normal . radiographs were three views of the right knee taken today and show implants in stable position . no evidence of loosening or early complications . thanks .","4654":"okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12\/27\/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ?","4655":"i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad .","4656":"great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ?","4657":"okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today .","4658":"sure . that makes a lot of sense .","4659":"goodness . okay . then what happened ?","4660":"okay .","4661":"wow . okay .","4662":"all right-y . then- then what happened ?","4663":"okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ?","4664":"okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel .","4665":"mhm . okay .","4666":"all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ?","4667":"got you . okay .","4668":"hmm . okay .","4669":"yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ?","4670":"okay .","4671":"all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ?","4672":"great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ?","4673":"okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ?","4674":"okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ?","4675":"i'm so sorry to hear that .","4676":"my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care .","4677":"okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ?","4678":"okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned .","4679":"okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ?","4680":"all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did .","4681":"okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?","4682":"okay . and any pain when you go pee ?","4683":"okay . and any blood in your pee ?","4684":"okay .","4685":"okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um-","4686":"all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented .","4687":"all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ?","4688":"good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee .","4689":"or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today .","4690":"i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead .","4691":"okay . and does ashley play any sports ?","4692":"how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water .","4693":"okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses .","4694":"good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have come all the way out here .","4695":"okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .","4696":"awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip . and , ashley , it was really nice to meet you . mom dad , you as well . and i hope you guys take care .","4697":"all right-y . past medical history , review of patient's grandfather's record , we see he had posterior urethral bowels valves and obstructive neur- neuropathy . uh , he developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial ... was dialysis-dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . , wait . is that right ?","4698":"yeah . that's ... yeah . that'll work 'cause i'm gon na have to drop for this . but i think we're good for everything else .","4699":"okay . yeah . he died in his 40s , but i thought it was from a massive heart attack . died at 47 of a massive heart-","4700":"not because of it . okay .","4701":"i see what you're saying .","4702":"doctor: got it . cool . i'm gon na stop-","4703":"hey sean nice to see you i heard you that you have some back pain","4704":"when was your back surgery","4705":"was that long ago","4706":"wow what happened what did they do","4707":"sounds horrible","4708":"that's good to know what kind of symptoms did you have with that","4709":"horrible nerve pain it sounds like","4710":"okay did they give you any meds for that","4711":"was that hard to withdraw from","4712":"okay so you have left side low back pain","4713":"does anything make it better or worse","4714":"she sounds smart . so stretching helps okay what about any physical activities do they make it worse","4715":"randomly okay so it hurt on the right side as well or just the left","4716":"is it right around where you had surgery","4717":"okay did you try icing","4718":"hmmm did you try any pain meds","4719":"what kind of pain meds did you","4720":"it's quite a high dose okay let me do a quick physical exam on your back here if you bend forward does that hurt","4721":"okay so no pain with flexion how about if you stand back up","4722":"okay no pain with extension either does it hurt while you're just standing here","4723":"okay so pain when you're weightbearing does it hurt when i push right here on the left side","4724":"pain with palpation to the left side around the l5 how about on the right side","4725":"no pain with palpation to the right side okay i'm just gon na push down on your feet can you push back up on my hands","4726":"alright dorsiflexion is normal looks like that you have normal range of motion so that's good any pain down your legs","4727":"great no nerve pain alright so we took an x-ray when you came in it looks like you do n't have any fractures or anything on the spinal bone that's good you can see where you had surgery it looks like everything has healed properly there so that's good news so what i think you did is you have a a muscle pull there from having a misalignment in your spine so what i'm gon na do is i'll prescribe some physical therapy for you you have great physical therapy here at the va so you can just come right to our physical therapist and that should help have you have you been there before","4728":"how do you feel about it","4729":"got it okay so i'm also gon na prescribe you some meloxicam instead of the ibuprofen that might help a little bit more with some of the pain management","4730":"lem me check your record quick for for pain management it's kind of a strong drug for vicodin and we do n't really like to prescribe that unless it's totally necessary so why do n't we start with the meloxicam and i also write a referral to pain management and they can talk to you a little bit about some of your pain and maybe not using narcotics to manage it","4731":"hmmm sure i'll prescribe demerol","4732":"yeah you're welcome any other problems going on today you want to talk about","4733":"alright well it was nice to see you today","4734":"well good morning emily how are you","4735":"how are you doing","4736":"i understand you're having some sudden visual distortions and some blurring of your vision is that right","4737":"okay so what's going on","4738":"macular degeneration yeah yeah i was because we do n't we do n't to do the intro anymore i was just going with that you you're coming in with sudden visual distortion and blurring of vision so i'll just you know i'll just say i'll just go ahead and go into this technician part so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines and your door frames have been looking crooked to you is that right","4739":"okay what kind of venture are we gon na go into do you do you have the the script or no it it just talks","4740":"okay i mean i can just straight out follow the script just so we can kinda get it rolling so so i said so hi so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines in your door frames have been looking crooked to you","4741":"uh okay so do you have a favorite restaurant you like to go to","4742":"that sounds good what what do you what's your favorite there","4743":"that sounds really nice very good","4744":"yeah okay well so it looks like you're still smoking a pack of cigarettes a day","4745":"okay and how is your blood pressure been doing are you keeping up with your medication","4746":"okay yeah it's really important to keep up with your blood pressure check that regularly i'm totally going off script and you know might want to keep a log of that as well and check your blood pressures regularly so okay well let me do a just a quick exam of your eyes if you can take off your glasses and just rest your chin on the chin rest okay so the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes right eye the cornea is clear no mvi pciol cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees without any tears or holes or pe changes in the fovea posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula thickening of the retina presence of subretinal fluid and exudates accumulation positive for hemorrhage left eye the cornea is clear no mvi cup to disc is . three or pe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage or subretinal fluid retina is attached okay so i reviewed the results of your diagnostic tests so for the oct so it shows drusen deposit and the retinal pigment epithelium subretinal fluid accumulation choroidal neovascular membrane can be visualized fluorescein angiography reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration so the diagnostic tests and the eye exam are really indicative of neovascular age related macular degeneration so this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss and it really happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina and they will leak fluid and blood and hints the name wet amd and can create a large blind spot in the center of the visual field and this is really with the most common cause for severe loss of vision so my plan is to give you an injection of lucentes once a month it's injected into the vitreous portion of the eye after it's been numbed and injections are given regularly over a period of time it may slow the rate of vision decline or stop further vision loss but however the disease and loss it may also progress despite treatment do you have any questions","4747":"hi jaqueline how are you i heard that you injured your ankle","4748":"what what happened to your ankle","4749":"okay well what were you doing were you hiking or biking or what were you doing","4750":"you were in a mountain biking lesson and you fell off your bike and twisted your ankle","4751":"and what ankle was bothering you","4752":"your right ankle okay and did it twist like did your ankle twist outward or did your ankle twist inward do you know","4753":"your ankle twisted outward and where are you having the most pain is it is it kind of like right on your outer ankle or is it more in your foot","4754":"it's in your outer ankle okay alright and do you have any numbing or tingling in your toes at all","4755":"really like where","4756":"alright well i'm an orthopedic person so i ca n't talk to you about your numbing hearts okay now are you able to move your ankle","4757":"are you able to walk on your ankle","4758":"are you limping","4759":"you're limping okay have you taken anything for the pain","4760":"you took tylenol","4761":"okay did that help at all","4762":"no it did n't help alright did you hear anything pop or anything like that when","4763":"you heard a crack","4764":"okay alright how long have you been mountain biking","4765":"three years wow","4766":"what where is your favorite place to go mountain biking","4767":"is it at north point","4768":"no it's not at north point","4769":"do you or do you like going to colorado","4770":"okay alright okay alright well let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i looked here at your vital signs and have you had any fever chills or anything like that since this happened","4771":"you've had a fever how high was your fever","4772":"that's not a fever alright okay so lem me go ahead you looking at your vital signs you do n't have a fever now your temperature is ninety eight . six your blood pressure is fine at one eighteen over seventy seven and your heart rate looks good at seventy seven beats per minute on your right ankle exam there is some edema and erythema on the lateral malleolus on the right hand side there is associated ecchymosis and a few excoriations does it hurt when i press on it","4773":"there is pain to palpation of the right lateral malleolus there is decreased flexion and extension of the right ankle as well as internal and external rotation there is no apparent injury to the knee or the foot okay so what does that mean jacqueline seem awfully giggling right now so what does that mean so i took a i had the nurse do an x-ray on you before i came in and reviewing the results of your right ankle x-ray shows that you have no acute fracture or bony abnormality which is good you just have a some soft tissue injury so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so for","4774":"yeah so for your assessment and plan i do believe you have a an acute right ankle sprain i wan na go ahead and put you in an air cast we can give you some crutches i wan na go ahead and prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day you should ice the area for about twenty minutes five times a day and weight-bear as tolerated i am anticipating you to start feeling better in the next couple of weeks if you're not come back here and see me and we will consider physical therapy or pursuing further imaging okay","4775":"hi betty how are you i i read in the medical records that you ended you did end up having a heart attack they ended up putting a stent in your right coronary artery how are you doing","4776":"yeah you know i'm i'm i'm glad that we went ahead and sent you to the emergency room now i know that you were in the hospital for about forty eight hours how are you feeling since you've been home you've been home a couple of weeks now how are you doing","4777":"okay and have you had any more of that chest pain since they put that stent in or is that completely gone","4778":"okay and i know that they went through your wrist for the cardiac catheterization how is your wrist doing","4779":"okay and you're right handed correct","4780":"okay alright and any shortness of breath when you walk around or move anything like that","4781":"okay now i know they put you on that medication the brilinta are you you're taking it correct","4782":"okay great and you're still taking your aspirin correct","4783":"yeah that's perfect as long as you take it once a day and you're able to afford the brilinta any issues with cost with that","4784":"okay alright so it's really gon na be really important for you to go ahead and continue to take these medications to prevent that stent from clogging again okay or prevent that stent from closing because we do n't want you to have another heart attack okay","4785":"okay and how about watching your diet are you able to watch your salt intake i know that you really liked a good pizza every now and again are you","4786":"you can have a piece here and there you know the pumping function of your heart was pretty normal when i saw from the hospital your ejection fraction that's the pumping function of your heart was at about fifty percent which is you know low normal but not bad so that's good so okay just i would just watch your salt intake okay","4787":"okay great and then you know i i'm i'm glad that you're taking it easy now remind me this might cause you some anxiety were the denver denver nuggets swept or did they end up winning are they still in the nba playoffs i forget i know that you are a denver nuggets fan","4788":"okay yeah i'm a self expand and and we just swept the brooklyn net so i was really excited about that","4789":"no one likes them okay well let's i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your blood pressure here in the office your blood pressure looks good it's about one twenty seven over sixty which is pretty good on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention there is no carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally and on your musculoskeletal exam your right radial artery cardiac cath site is clean dry and intact there is no hematoma and there is a palpable radial pulse now what does that mean betty so all of that means is that you know you have a little bit of a heart murmur after having the heart attack but i looked on the echocardiogram and it showed that you know you do have mild mitral regurgitation which is just you know a little floppy valve which is is fine we'll just keep an eye on that and then everything else for the most part looks good so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of your inferior myocardial myocardial infarction i wan na go ahead and continue with your aspirin continue on your brilinta you're gon na stay on the brilinta for at least one year and aspirin you're gon na take lifelong until i tell you to okay i wan na go ahead and have you continue on the crestor forty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and put in another echocardiogram for about six months okay do you have any questions about that","4790":"yeah so at this point you're you know you're out like two weeks and your and your cath site is looks good so you can go ahead and and resume swimming now with that being said i would want you to just do a few laps here and there i do want to enroll you into cardiac rehab that's gon na give you a bit more confidence to go back to exercising and they also give a lot of dietary education and counseling in cardiac rehab does that sounds like something that you can do","4791":"okay i agree alright i also want you to go ahead and continue with your toprol fifty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and order a some liver function studies and a lipid panel to follow up with the next time we meet and i want to see you again in probably six weeks okay","4792":"okay any questions","4793":"doctor: okay take care bye","4794":"and good morning hi beverly","4795":"how do you see your last name","4796":"howard nice to meet you","4797":"what can i do for you today","4798":"and when did that happen","4799":"okay and which knee are we talking about","4800":"alright and tell me exactly what happened","4801":"okay is it getting better getting worse or just kinda lingering on","4802":"well it all it all depends everyone's different we'll get to that","4803":"and your knee was not bothering you at all before this normal knee","4804":"never okay alright what do you do for living","4805":"gotcha what do you do outside of outside of work is biking kinda your thing","4806":"okay have you broke up with him already or","4807":"we'll talk about that later too","4808":"alright so let's take a let's take a peek at your knee here","4809":"you gon na stick it through the screen or how you're gon na do this alright","4810":"alright then i'm just i'm gon na i'm gon na grab your leg we're just gon na take it through just let it relax i'm just gon na take it through a little range of motion i'm gon na kinda poke around all different places you tell me where it hurts okay","4811":"alright now i'm poking i'm poking i'm poking so on the inside part here is this where it hurts","4812":"right there okay tell me what's worse here or here","4813":"okay so medial joint line tenderness","4814":"pes bursa nontender epicondyle nontender back of her knee nice and soft any pain back here","4815":"okay popliteal space is nontender how about over on this side","4816":"okay lateral side nontender skin she has got about a dime size little abrasions dry looks about a week week old right over the medial patella everything else looks good no scars okay how about can you straighten it out all the way","4817":"yep that's good though full full extension how far can you bend it","4818":"okay let's see","4819":"good good and how about the other side let me see the left knee can you bend that one all the way back too","4820":"okay full full symmetric flexion no no deformities go ahead and just let it relax","4821":"valgus stress medial collateral ligament intact lateral collateral ligament intact okay so little kind of little laxity posterior drawer let me see the other let me see the other knee","4822":"yeah so that that feels pretty much normal so she's got a about a one plus posterior drawer anterior drawer negative lachman negative good let's go ahead and just kinda bend and straighten for me","4823":"good patellar patella tracks fine no crepitus alright let's go back to this medial side you're tender right there is that right","4824":"it's tender on the medial joint line but actually negative mcmurray negative lateral side negative mcmurray good so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts","4825":"what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like","4826":"yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it","4827":"you actually no","4828":"what about you i mean are you real weak","4829":"did you go to the gym","4830":"okay i ca n't treat people like you you you you need to work harder","4831":"yes sir work harder","4832":"do you do you play sports in in college or high school","4833":"yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids","4834":"just kinda you're thinking walking the dog","4835":"on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee","4836":"well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off","4837":"it's pretty bad","4838":"we'll get we'll get to that too","4839":"so did you already have x-rays of this knee today","4840":"okay do i go into that to","4841":"look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it","4842":"let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like","4843":"i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery","4844":"but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament","4845":"does that make sense","4846":"yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here","4847":"so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier","4848":"so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses","4849":"okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner","4850":"we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first","4851":"it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy","4852":"and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary","4853":"and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this","4854":"i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right","4855":"did you get did you select you last night","4856":"you yeah what do you think what do you roof for","4857":"are you serious","4858":"rockets","4859":"yeah yeah that's not that's not my problem though you have not do you not watch the bulls","4860":"my gosh alright we're gon na have to work on you","4861":"you got four to six weeks to get your attitude straight we'll talk about this later okay","4862":"alright very good any questions at all","4863":"so hi zachary good to see you today so i'm looking at my notes i see you coming in with some right elbow pain and you also have a past medical history of hypertension diabetes we're gon na check on those so can you tell me what happened to your elbow","4864":"it was hurting okay how long ago would you say that was","4865":"since yesterday alright","4866":"okay they must have written that down wrong so it is your your left arm are you right handed or left handed","4867":"okay so do you think you might have slept on it wrong or anything like that or what","4868":"so what part of your elbow would you say hurts","4869":"elbow up to the neck alright is it your entire elbow or or would you say a a individual part of it is painful","4870":"all the way up the arm alright","4871":"okay and what would you describe the pain as is it like a stabbing pain is it numb what what's going on","4872":"achiness okay did you do anything yesterday that you think might have caused the pain","4873":"okay do you remember i know sometimes do chores you end up lifting heavy things do you remember doing that","4874":"okay alright have you taken anything for the pain yet","4875":"okay and would you say that worked for you","4876":"okay alright so we'll we'll take a look at your your arm there because it's like your entire left arm up from your shoulder to your elbow does hurt in a second we'll do an exam of that so i see you're also coming in we're gon na check on your hypertension and you came in today your blood pressure is a little bit high it was one fifty over ninety i do n't think we talked last time about us getting you a blood pressure cuff so you could take those and keep track and and and and let us know so what have your blood pressures been running lately","4877":"okay that's not","4878":"that's not too bad you might have a little white coat syndrome you seeing me today because it's a little bit high today so you're on that two . five of norvasc have you been taking that","4879":"okay that's good how about your diet how is that going i know you were having a little trouble before your sot intake was a little bit high","4880":"alright so as far as your diabetes your last time you came in let's say look at your a1c result it was a seven . two you were on the five hundred of metformin so what have your blood sugars been running","4881":"you do n't check them okay so yeah we can get a a glucose test today and and and just check those because that's something we want to do everyday you know just to make sure you're eating the correct amount and that your sugars are are in range to make sure that and also to make sure that our medication is is the right amount as well so we'll do that that glucose test at the end of your visit and we could see if we can adjust your medication or not so let's go ahead and do a physical exam on you so i just want to double check make sure are you having any chest pain","4882":"okay comes with elbow pain arm pain","4883":"chest pain","4884":"up your neck alright","4885":"comes and goes alright how often is that chest pain happening to you you said it's not constant","4886":"okay so every hour every fifteen minutes would you say","4887":"okay alright have you had any shortness of breath","4888":"no okay just the chest pain alright","4889":"so i'm gon na listen to your heart here and it it does seem like i do hear a slight murmur with your heart here and i i do n't think we've we've heard that before so i think i'm gon na get an ekg as well because i'm concerned you might be having like a mild heart attack so because you have the pain all the way up your elbow that go into your neck and your your chest pain as well i do n't think it's it's it's musculoskeletal pain because you said you had n't done anything with it so far so what i wan na do is and let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan here so i i do think that you or you do have that chest pain i'm concerned that you know you might be having a mild heart attack i'm gon na get ekg for that we're also gon na get you some aspirin is a nitroglycerin just to see if that helps with that pain as far as your for your diabetes i want you we're gon na get that p oct glucose and we'll keep you on be five hundred of metformin for now and then for your hypertension we'll keep you on that two . five of of norvasc but i think our most immediate issue is the is the chest pain and so we'll do the ekg and depending upon those results we'll we'll call nine one one because we really need to get you to the hospital if that is the case so how does that sound","4890":"i did n't hear about that no","4891":"okay could stop doing what","4892":"no well yeah i did n't hear about joe biting and and his his not ability his ability did not stop pooping probably had a diarrhea i'm not sure i did n't

ca n't stop pooten he's he's he's in charge of my united states but right now i'm i'm really you know me i'm concerned about your heart so i do wan na get the ekg just to make sure you know it'll be would n't be good if we did n't get that you know in the case that you you leave here something terrible happened and and i would n't want that to happen on my watch so","4895":"we'll definitely get those tests","4896":"yeah no problem we'll get those tests and my nurse will come in and we'll we'll we'll take it from there does that sound good","4897":"alright thanks","4898":"karen is a 34

is there anything that you notice that makes that pain worse or better like rest or movement or eating or anything else","4902":"hmmm okay","4903":"okay alright and do you notice that pain radiates anywhere or moves you know any or anywhere","4904":"okay and have you had any nausea or vomiting along with the pain","4905":"okay and and this is this is this is worse with you said worse worse with meals and is there anything else anything else that that makes it worse","4906":"okay sure any pain with urination or any blood in your urine","4907":"okay and how about any diarrhea and any of that or blood in your stool no","4908":"okay alright and so would you say that your appetite has been normal or decreased or any different","4909":"okay okay you did n't overeat you know during the super bowl last weekend did you that was i know probably lots of junk food floating around if your house is anything like mine","4910":"okay well that's good that's good and and no no travel i know you're a big big travel travel fan you know i remember you telling me about your trip to europe last summer that sounded amazing have you been traveling outside of the country again recently","4911":"okay alright great and okay so so tell me about your migraines how have they been are you still taking the sumatriptan you know as needed when when you developed migraine you have have you had a migraine recently","4912":"okay okay great yeah you've learned a lot about it and and the treatments including the the term analgesic and all of that that's pretty impressive you've been you've been through the ringer i think with with those so okay and so you're taking excedrin when you get a migraine and then sort of would you say maybe for breakthrough migraines or worse migraines you'd take a sumatriptan occasionally","4913":"okay got it and how about your blood pressure how has that been running at home are you checking your blood pressures daily still and how how your how how have your blood pressures been","4914":"okay okay not not too bad it does look like you're a little bit elevated today i i maybe i'm just making you nervous though so i hope not so are you but you're still on lisinopril twenty milligrams per day correct it looks like you might be running low do you need a refill of that","4915":"sure we can do that and so okay but you are still taking that twenty milligrams per day correct","4916":"okay and alright fair enough so so let's go ahead and and examine you now karen so on your physical exam pretty normal and and unremarkable for the most part on your on your heart exam i do hear that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that you've still got that's unchanged from prior exam that just means i hear some heart sounds you know as i'm listening to your heart there i'm not too concerned about that we'll watch that otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and then your your abdominal exam gastrointestinal exam you have some tenderness in the right upper quadrant i would say mild to moderate tenderness and now if you take a deep breath does that and i press here does that hurt you","4917":"okay yeah you have i would call an equivocal murphy's sign in the right upper quadrant on your abdominal examination as well the rest of your abdomen is soft and no significant tenderness you have no tenderness in the right lower quadrant with deep palpation and you have no cva tenderness on your back exam as well and so we will talk about about that i am a little bit concerned about the tenderness that that i find on your abdominal exam the remainder of your exam karen is pretty normal and unremarkable and and so that's good let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan so first of all for your first problem of abdominal pain you you do seem to have acute abdominal pain with right upper quadrant tenderness that i'm concerned maybe a sign of some gallstones or possibly even an infection in your gallbladder so i'm gon na order some blood tests and an ultrasound today i'm gon na order a cbc chem twelve urinalysis a pregnancy test and also right upper quadrant ultrasound and so we will we will get those tests done right away i'm gon na keep you here we'll see how those look fortunately we've got the facilities for those and if we need to send you to the emergency department based on those results we will i do n't want you to eat anything right now okay in case we find something that might require surgery alright unlikely but it's possible and then okay you know karen i meant to ask you on your history one thing by chance have you had a fever along with this abdominal pain","4918":"okay alright alright good yeah i i see you do n't have a fever today so that's that's good and so alright now for your second problem the migraine headaches you you do have a history of chronic migraines and and you have occasional bouts of of migraines nothing recent so let's continue the excedrin as needed over the counter for treatment there and then also the sumatriptan as needed for breakthrough migraine pain and i i would just encourage you to continue to avoid alcohol binges and caffeine binges and try to get enough sleep and all of that's easier said than done i know so but but that seems to be helping you now for your third problem of hypertension your blood pressure seems to be under adequate control so that's good we'll continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams per day and i will write you a refill prescription for that and send that to the pharmacy please continue to check your blood pressures daily so karen how does that all sound for a plan any other questions for me","4919":"okay alright sure yeah no problem so for your migraines the migraine problem i'm also gon na write you that that refill prescription for sumatriptan and anything else you can think of","4920":"alright sounds good we'll see you back in about four weeks or so and actually i am gon na follow up on your results today before i let you go but i'll check on those and and we'll we'll see how how you do and and hopefully be able to get you home today so we'll go from there i'll i'll see you shortly","4921":"good alright hello hannah how are you today","4922":"you're doing well","4923":"okay tell me more about that cough","4924":"okay okay so you you started having some mucus with it","4925":"okay and how about any other symptoms with your cough","4926":"okay okay and how about any fevers","4927":"no fever okay and then any shortness of breath","4928":"no shortness of breath okay and what have you been doing for your cough","4929":"it's not helping okay and tell me do you have any history of any seasonal allergies","4930":"okay okay and then any how about any body aches for you","4931":"nausea or vomiting","4932":"okay alright so we will definitely examine you and talk more about that and as far as your diabetes how has everything been going with that checking your sugars how has that been going","4933":"okay okay and i know the metformin is a we started you on a lower dose it's the five hundred milligrams it's a new medication for you you've been tolerating it okay","4934":"okay good any diarrhea sometimes patients will say that","4935":"no diarrhea okay and then how about as far as your blood pressure","4936":"seventy okay so a bit high and the hydrochlorothiazide have you been able to take that everyday","4937":"okay and how about your diet how's been thing as far as salty foods","4938":"okay okay but it seems like you've been making good progress and that could be difficult sometimes and you mentioned being around i think you said your sister a few days ago or a family member","4939":"after that okay and how is your family doing how is everyone doing other than that other than being sick for your sister how is everyone going","4940":"okay and for you too were you on vacation last week and a lot of people had vacation last week","4941":"okay hopefully you were n't sick for too much of it","4942":"okay okay","4943":"sorry about that alright so what i'm gon na do now is i'm gon na go ahead and start your physical exam i looking at your vitals vitals look overall pretty good i do see your blood pressure is elevated at here it's one forty four over seventy two otherwise everything else looks good so let's check you out so first starting i'm just gon na check start with your sinuses and when i press here do you have any pain any tenderness when i do that","4944":"no okay so no frontal sinus tenderness how about when i press on the on your cheeks here","4945":"on both sides","4946":"okay so bilateral maxillary sinus tenderness alright and i'm just gon na take a look at in your mouth if you can open up okay so i do see some do have some erythema of the pharynx and the tonsils are symmetrical i do n't appreciate any exudates now i'm just checking your neck and i do appreciate some anterior cervical adenopathy alright and i'm just gon na take a listen to you alright so listening to your heart so you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and you do still have that two out of six systolic ejection murmur at the left base now i'm taking listen to your lungs and on your lungs exam okay your lungs are nice and clear i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales or rhonchi alright and just looking at your lower extremities i do n't appreciate any edema there so let's talk about my assessment and plan so for your first problem of the cough so looking at your cough it does seem like you have a upper respiratory infection and so basically that's a virus most likely it's a virus that's causing your symptoms especially being around someone else who has similar symptoms and seems like most likely they spread it to you so i want you to continue with doing a lot of the time is just letting the virus run it's course and taking things just to help with your symptoms so drinking lots of fluids that's gon na help you trying i know you've been doing a cough medicine you can even try another one you have to be careful with the blood pressure and diabetes so you can try like a coricidin hbp can help with the cough and lots of rest okay lots of rest now we are in a current pandemic and so something i can check for you if you're okay with that is checking for covid if that's okay with you","4947":"okay so we will check you for that today and see how you're doing with that and then we will give you those results okay any questions about that","4948":"no okay so for problem number two the type two diabetes so we'll continue you on your metformin five hundred milligrams daily or twice a day you had blood work at your last visit so you'll be due at your next visit for your hemoglobin a1c and that's the check the sugars on your red blood cells so we do that about every three months so at your next visit we'll check that for you and then we will go from there but it seems like you're doing well with that now as far as problem number three your high blood pressure so your blood pressure is elevated here and it sounds like it's been you know creeping up just a little bit at home as well you're on a very tiny dose of the hydrochlorothiazide so what i would like to do is increase it to twenty five milligrams once a day again i would recommend that you take it in the morning just because you may have noticed it can make you urinate quite a bit and then i would love for you to just continue checking as you have been a few times a week just checking your blood pressure at different times of the day so we can continue to see how you do with that okay","4949":"alright any questions for me","4950":"doctor: thank you alright so at this point now i'm just gon na press the i'm gon na","4951":"hey betty how're you","4952":"wow well i'm sorry to hear that do you remember what you were doing when the pain started","4953":"wow okay and do you know if there was any direct or associated trauma that you can think of over the past three weeks like did you fall or hit your shoulder or anything","4954":"okay now have you ever had pain in that shoulder before","4955":"okay and and it's isolated to your left shoulder","4956":"okay are you able to move that left arm for me","4957":"okay so now i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain are you having pain all of the time or does it wax and wane does it come and go","4958":"okay so you ca n't lay on your left side at all","4959":"alright now do you have that pain when you lay on your back as well or just on your left side","4960":"okay now let's talk just briefly about your pain so if you have n't taken anything at all or have you been taking anything at all let's start with that have you been taking anything for the pain","4961":"okay that's good now without any tylenol what's your pain level","4962":"okay and then with tylenol with that","4963":"okay that's good so the tylenol really does help you that that's a good thing","4964":"so you talked about renovating your basement did you guys just move in or is it just time for a little house facelift","4965":"nice have you been into the new home depot that they just opened down the street here","4966":"yeah it's nice my wife and i were there this weekend and they just opened two weeks ago so everything's fully stocked and if you guys are doing some renovations you might run down there and you know save big money at home depot","4967":"so are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your arm or hand","4968":"okay so if you do n't mind i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam i've reviewed your vitals everything looks good there and i'm gon na do a focused exam of your left shoulder now you have limited active and passive range of motion there is some tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus and there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or clavicular joints and you have good hand grip bilaterally neurovascular exam of your left arm your cap refill is brisk in less than three seconds and motor and sensation is intact to light touch now for review of your x-ray of that left shoulder the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality so let me talk to you briefly about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy this means that the tendons of the muscles of that left shoulder have been injured and the injury happened to the tendons that make up or attach to the shoulder muscles i'm gon na go ahead and order an mri of your shoulder just to make sure nothing else is going on with that left shoulder i'm also going to go ahead and refer you for physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks okay now during that time i want you to continue to take tylenol p.r.n . if your symptoms do n't improve we can then consider maybe like a steroid injection of that left shoulder which could hopefully get you some relief now do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan","4969":"i do i do believe that that pain is gon na go away many of my patients are successful with pt so we are gon na start with that take a conservative approach and see how you do","4970":"alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you some paperwork and i'll see you in about two about two weeks","4971":"doctor: thank you","4972":"hey matthew how is it going good to see you today i see here in your notes you are here for some right knee pain and we are also going to check up on your hypertension and diabetes so can you tell me what happened to your knee","4973":"okay playing basketball how often do you play basketball","4974":"first time in two

basketball you you heard felt some knee your knee pop what part of your knee would you say hurts","4977":"inside of your knee alright and are you able to bear weight on that leg matthew","4978":"okay so what type of pain would you describe as it is it stabbing is it","4979":"real achy","4980":"okay have you taken anything for the pain yet","4981":"alright did that work for you","4982":"little do you have any","4983":"yeah i be i bet i bet i i hurt my knee before too and it's it's pretty painful on a scale of one to ten what would you say your your pain level is","4984":"about a four okay so it's it's not too bad alright so we'll take a look at that knee in a second so we're also here to check up on your hypertension and diabetes so i'm looking here for your hypertension you're taking five milligrams of norvasc so are you taking that daily","4985":"yes great i i i'm so happy when my patients are compliant most of the times they do n't take it as as often but i'm i'm really excited for that what have your blood pressures been running i think today","4986":"i mean it's it's not the best right it's it's we should be around one twenty over eighty right","4987":"you're a little bit elevated and we could talk about changing your medications to try to get that that down how about your diet how's that going","4988":"alright well we we definitely got ta got ta get your your diet a little bit better i know after the pandemic a lot of people you know went crazy with the diet myself included but i know we got ta get you get back in because for your diabetes i'm looking at your a1c and we we checked it and it was a a seven point two which is not so good right now so have you been taking i think you're on metformin five hundred milligrams daily","4989":"okay so yeah we definitely got ta get you to to take it we could try something else just if you're having interaction with that medication what about your blood sugars are they taking those daily","4990":"every once in a while what have they been doing every once in a while when when you do take them","4991":"okay so we got to get those down too so we will talk about getting you consult nutrition just try to get you a better diet i think you know we wan na get you off the medications totally but you know we got ta get you on the right track here alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you i'm gon na check your your your lungs lungs sound good check your heart so listen to your heart you still do have that grade two out of systolic ejection murmur alright but we we knew about that already you've had that for a couple of years so i'm not really worried about that at this at this time so let me take a look at your knee here so when i press right here on the inside the right knee is that painful","4992":"ow alright and let me have you bend it straighten it it's painful","4993":"a little bit alright i'm gon na do a couple of maneuvers here so your your right knee exam shows that you do have pain to palpation of the medial aspect of that right knee also have some edema some little bit of swelling some ecchymosis as well you do have a negative varus and valgus test of my maneuvers and you know i i do see a little bit of of swelling swelling little redness as well in that knee so we did get an x-ray of your knee your right knee luckily it was normal so there's no fractures no bony abnormalities which is good so you did n't break anything so based on my your based on your x-ray and your exam you have a mcl tear well mcl strain i apologize mcl is straight i do n't know if you have a tear yet we got ta do yeah we had to have to do a mri for that but basically means you twisted your knee when you're playing basketball right and so that ligament is strained or torn just to have to get an mri to determine if it is or not in the time being i want you to continue to take that tylenol just to help with that pain i'm also gon na prescribe you some meloxicam fifteen milligrams just to help with the pain and swelling i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer and i want you to stay off of that for the next couple of weeks and we're gon na get a mri as well for that knee how does that sound","4994":"alright for your diabetes i'm going to need you we got to get you to start taking your your blood sugars daily we got to keep track of those alright so i want you to take those daily we'll get a log book so you can keep track of those and bring those back and we can determine how we adjust your medications for now also i'm going to give you a consult to nutrition to try to get your diet a little bit better and then for your hypertension i'm gon na up your medication up up up up your norvasta five milligrams because your blood pressure is a little bit high and hopefully we can a medication adjustment will lower it down to that one twenty over eighty like we like we made alright so i'm going to see you back in two weeks do you have any other questions","4995":"you know i i have n't i have n't heard that before you know","4996":"your diabetes is n't going so low right now so stay away from the strawberries because that's a lot of sugar

day","5009":"okay you are not missing doses or anything are you by chance","5010":"okay great great you're still using that pill box that we suggested i think you had a pretty good system going there

in his softball or in his in his little league tournament last month i think you said he had a big tournament coming up how did that go","5012":"wow wow how fun that's fantastic well congrats good stuff alright well listen so so you're still taking your your lisinopril how about for your hyperlipidemia your your high cholesterol there are you still taking that atorvastatin","5013":"okay excellent and your osteoarthritis i know you've been you know a golfer in the past and you know you wan na get out on the course and things is that still under control are you able to get out and and and walk the full course and things still","5014":"yeah yeah but you're still okay well you're still able to get out and then you're kinda taking i think you're taking some tylenol for for you know mild mild pain and changing your activity as needed is that right","5015":"okay alright good good okay well listen let's go ahead and examine you here jerry so on your physical exam for the most part it's pretty normal and unremarkable on your heart exam you still have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior and just means yeah i'm hearing some heart sounds from the valves that's that's not surprising and i'm not concerned about it we're just watching that one otherwise on your your lung exam you have some mild bibasilar rales but no wheezes or rhonchi and excellent air movement and you have trace lower extremity edema on your extremity exam there bilaterally and otherwise really pretty normal exam so let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan alright so first of all for your first problem of your elevated blood pressure i do think your blood pressure is a little bit out of control meaning we need to make some adjustments i'm going to actually increase your your lisinopril to sixty milligrams twice per day and i'm also going to add twenty five milligrams per day of hydrochlorothiazide and that should help even things out i want you to check your blood pressure measurements twice a day for me for the next two weeks then let's see you back in two weeks and we'll we'll check on how you're doing and also for your second problem of hyperlipidemia i i wan na keep you on the atorvastatin i'm also going to send couple of blood tests i'm gon na send a cholesterol panel also a cbc with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel and we'll check a urinalysis as well look and see how your kidneys are doing there as well and so we'll continue the current management with your atorvastatin there for your hyperlipidemia now for your third problem osteoarthritis i want you to continue to stay active as best you can do n't over do it but walking and you know getting out golfing when you can that's great you can take tylenol for the pain if you have some mild some mild pain there and yeah otherwise i think that cover it i think the adjustments in your blood pressure medicine should help and i wan na see you back in four weeks no let's make two weeks in follow-up and otherwise any questions for me how does that sound","5016":"yeah you know be sure you're staying well hydrated you know six to eight glasses of water per day is a good good idea and you you know when when it warms up you're certainly gon na prespire more and lose lose more fluid so so i would i would recommend that you continue to have you know a a standard six to eight glasses of of fluid intake per day but yeah that you know that should do it and if you're feeling particularly dehydrated you might wan na increase that if you have an increased activity level so alright any other questions for me","5017":"probably not the best thing with you know with with with your high blood pressure fluctuating the way it is so not more than a couple drinks a week hate to tell you","5018":"doctor: alright okay great seeing you we'll see you back see you in a couple of weeks you take care","5019":"so donna is a 37 -year-old female she is here with complaint of headache she has a history of hypertension and diabetes so donna tell me what's going on","5020":"do you remember the numbers that you're getting on your blood pressure readings","5021":"okay so it's really high i was looking back and it looks like your blood pressure was pretty normal last time we saw you is one twenty four over eighty two have you been able to take your blood pressure medicine the lisinopril that you've been prescribed","5022":"yeah well i'm also curious you know you have diabetes have you been checking your blood sugar","5023":"okay and have you noticed are you urinating more than usual or anything like that","5024":"okay and when you get these headaches what are you taking for them","5025":"okay and when you first had the headaches what would you rate the headache at zero no pain ten the worst pain ever","5026":"and then after you take the tylenol what does it go down to","5027":"yeah and have you ever had headaches like this before","5028":"okay and have you had any congestion anything like that cough runny nose","5029":"okay if you tap on your forehead do you have any tenderness","5030":"okay if you tap down here on these bones your cheek bones any tenderness there","5031":"okay and then if you kinda push on your neck around here any tenderness","5032":"okay okay so you do n't have any frontal sinus tenderness no

we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct","5053":"i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him

one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerular nephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these

happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh","5062":"we might

you are a patient of mine i want i want to continue to see you over a long period of time so it's important for you to to you know watch your diet you know because we can have some complications from diabetes like kidney dysfunction and eye problems and things like that and i know that you are 74 and you know you have n't really had a lot of issues up until this point and you know so you have a you know still a long life to live so i would like to see you you know try to you know monitor your diet and and your blood sugars are you taking the metformin","5094":"okay i'm not really sure what it looks like but you're supposed to be taking a thousand milligrams twice a day are you taking it twice a day","5095":"okay how is your wife doing she is a very lovely person i i i remember seeing her at your last visit","5096":"yeah i say the same thing to my husband okay well let's go ahead i wanted you to just do a quick physical exam so i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so looking here at your vital signs you know you do n't have a fever here in the office which is good your temperature is ninety eight . four on your blood pressure it seems like you are doing a pretty good job monitoring your blood pressure your blood pressure is right where it should be it's about one twenty five over sixty two which is good your heart rate is nice and slow in the eighties and your oxygenation is fine it's ninety seven percent on room air so all of that is is really good now on on your facial exam i'm just pressing on your face here do you have any pain to palpation","5097":"on one on what side","5098":"okay okay on on facial examination the patient has pain to palpation of the bilateral maxillary sinuses on nasal exam there are there is erythema and edema of the nasal turbinates bilaterally with associated yellow discharge on throat exam can you open up your mouth on your throat exam the the uvula is midline there is no erythema or edema or exudate in the peritonsillar space on neck examination i do appreciate some bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and on your lung exam there is coarse rhonchi present bilaterally that clears with cough on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur and on your right knee exam does it hurt when i press here","5099":"okay there is pain to palpation on the right knee and i'm just gon na move it all around does that hurt","5100":"okay so there is decreased flexion and extension of the right knee there is associated ecchymosis to the right medial knee there is no evidence of an effusion okay so billy what does all of that mean that means that you just have signs of that you have a little bit of an upper respiratory infection that might have caused some congestion in your in your lungs which we will talk about okay and then and as far as your knee exam it just shows that you do have some inflammation and some evidence that you had injured it earlier so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you for all of these issues okay so for your first problem of your cough you know i do believe that you just have a a viral syndrome at this time you probably have some mild bronchitis i really just wan na go ahead and just you know recommend some supportive care you can continue to take over the counter medications we can prescribe guaifenesin six hundred six hundred milligrams twice a day to help cough up some of that phlegm and i do n't think you need need any antibiotics at this time but certainly if your symptoms worsen i want you to call me and then we can go ahead and consider ordering a chest x-ray to make sure that you do n't have any pneumonia okay how does that sound","5101":"okay so for your second problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have a a a right medial collateral ligament strain from the fall this morning and i really wan na just go ahead and and i'll prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and we can refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen those muscles around that area and i'm gon na go ahead and just order a right knee x-ray just to make sure that you did n't injure any bones although i do n't think you did but we'll just go ahead and order that right knee x-ray how does that sound","5102":"okay and then for your third problem of your hypertension let's just continue on the lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and lastly your fourth problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c just to make sure we do n't have to make any adjustments to your metformin and i really want you to try to monitor your sugar intake and report your blood sugars to me through the patient portal how does that sound","5103":"alright that sounds good i'll i'll be in touch with you with those results okay","5104":"doctor: alright take care bye","5105":"alright okay theresa so i understand that you're you're having a bit of some headache here and then your blood pressure has been running high can you tell me a little bit about what's happening","5106":"okay alright and then so how long have you had this headache has this been recent or like acute or you've been having this for since you've had your blood pressures","5107":"a month okay alright and then are you having any other kind of symptoms with that like are you having any kind of you know dizziness lightheadedness any nausea vomiting","5108":"okay alright how about like chest pain or shortness of breath are you experiencing any of that when you have these headaches in your blood pressure","5109":"okay very good alright and then you said you were you've taken some tylenol for that and you said it did help a little bit or did n't sorry","5110":"it does help good very good so how often are you taking your your medication are you taking that as prescribed like daily it sounds like you missed a few times but for the most part are you taking it","5111":"okay every other day alright and then are you also now i know you also have some diabetes so are you how are you doing with that one are you pretty much taking your metformin everyday","5112":"every other day okay so i do see that you know the nurse took your your vital signs this morning that your blood pressure is running quite a bit high it was like one seventy two over ninety eight so that's that's really a little higher than where we want it to be especially that you're on your medication but what we're gon na do is we're gon na take i'm gon na take a look at you real quick and then we can discuss you know maybe there's some changes that we can do in terms of your current regimen how about diet and your have you been sticking with that low sodium diet at all","5113":"i love mcdonald's too my favorite is big mac i do n't know about you but i got ta have my big mac with those large fries which you what's your favorite mcdonald's treat there","5114":"well at least you're eating the fish but but they can be very high in sodium especially the fast foods so we'll have to talk about maybe they can look at you know some some diet changes as well so the other thing is for your for your blood sugar here i see that you know you're running a bit high as well it looks like you're like you're about one seventy this morning and i i i i assume that you were fasting last night is that right okay so that's that's a little higher than what we want it's not bad it's below two hundred but it's getting kinda close to the borderline from where our limit is so we will take we take a look at that and also we'll figure out what we can do with that as well alright so at this point how about are you how is how is work how is life it's been good otherwise how's the family","5115":"okay alright great alright alright just just around easter okay not not too much during the the year hopefully","5116":"well that's good so let's go ahead and do a physical exam on you real quick here okay and so i'm looking at your vital signs it looks like your blood pressure i we mentioned that today is pretty high your heart rate looks good it's with it's within normal limits here and then your oxygenation is fine so you did mention you did n't have any shortness of breath so that's good so let me just feel around your neck real quick here i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention on your neck exam i no carotid bruits so that's good let me go ahead and listen to your lungs and your heart here real quick alright so on your auscultation of your lungs they're clear bilaterally on your heart exam though i i do sense a two out of six systolic ejection murmur now that was also there last year so it has n't changed any so we'll just keep monitoring that one and then let me take a look at your extremities here real quick theresa so let me look at your hands you got a little bit of slight edema bilaterally on your upper extremities but let me look at your legs here okay so you have a one plus pitting edema noted here on your legs bilaterally so that means you're retaining a lot of that salt that you're eating unfortunately okay so so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan here so definitely what you're experiencing is some uncontrolled hypertension now most of the time you know it's multifactorial right it's your diet it could be the medication regimen if you're not following that and then it might be that we are gon na need to change the medication around and also change your diet but i would like to start with going ahead and i want to continue your current medication regimen today i do wan na really encourage that you do take that everyday maybe set a reminder like on your you know do you use your iphone a lot for your reminders and things maybe we can go ahead and do that get a reminder make sure that you take that everyday but with that i would like to go ahead and also monitor your blood pressure let's do it three times a week it can be much when we do it everyday but maybe three times a week do you have a blood pressure monitor at home","5117":"okay so i can recommend some really good ones nowadays that you can use at home and they're not that expensive and at least it'll give you some you know idea of what your blood pressure is running at and then i want you to come back like in a month because i wan na go ahead and see how your blood pressure is doing now that you know you're you you're taking your blood pressure medication everyday the other thing is i do wan na go ahead and have a nutritionist come and talk to you about you may maybe some dietary changes i'd like for you to start a \u2013 diet it's really to to help you know a lot of reduce a lot of that sodium intake when you're when you're when you're taking in your food so a nutritionist is gon na be able to help you figure out some foods that you know that you may like that you can actually use as an alternative besides the mcdonald's although you can have that once in a blue moon but you know not not too often okay","5118":"great and then for your diabetes i wan na go ahead and let's go ahead and increase your your metformin to fifteen hundred milligrams i think all for that too i want you to go ahead and continue taking your blood sugars to make sure as as you normally would to make sure that you know that change in medication is is actually being effective alright do you have any other questions for me at this time","5119":"okay great well i'm gon na have the nurse check you out and and i'll have the scheduler schedule you for a one month follow-up we'll take a look and see how you're doing from there see if we have then we will move from there okay","5120":"doctor: thanks theresa","5121":"hey steven so i see that you're here and you've been experiencing some back pain for a while could you tell me a bit about that","5122":"mm-hmm","5123":"okay so let's start start with what happened did something cause the pain","5124":"mm-hmm","5125":"okay and then how severe is the pain on a scale of like one to ten","5126":"wow okay could you describe it for me is it like sharp is it throbbing","5127":"and does it radiate","5128":"and does it radiate anywhere","5129":"okay alright","5130":"wow okay and how about like so hmmm you said it goes down your left leg how about any like are you experiencing any loss of sensation in like the genital or rectal area","5131":"that's okay i i it's gon na help me isolate like what's what exactly is going on so please do n't feel embarrassed to answer the questions do you have any weakness","5132":"okay so would you would you say that there are certain positions that make you feel better or worse","5133":"and then you said that standing also makes it worse right","5134":"okay and then have you experienced any like loss of control of like your bladder or your bowels","5135":"okay so incontinence just once though like over the last two years right it's not like a consistent thing","5136":"okay okay you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past like what were they","5137":"okay alright and i see in your chart here that you had physical therapy did you feel that that was effective","5138":"okay but did the did the exercises help","5139":"okay not a so not as effective as we would have liked did they put you on any pain medications","5140":"okay do n't worry i think i can look that up in your chart i just wan na make sure that we have the story straight alright so i know that you said that you mentioned that you played basketball you know before how how like what's your activity like now","5141":"okay that's a pretty okay that's a pretty significant weight gain well i i just have a few more questions have you do you know if any of your family members have spine conditions","5142":"okay okay but that's that's a little distant but anybody direct like sister brother mom dad","5143":"okay okay and then do you have a personal history of smoking","5144":"any smoke you do n't have to tell me exactly but","5145":"have you smoked","5146":"are you it's okay i'm your doctor i'm not here to judge you i just want to make sure that i'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you i need to know this information so one more time do you smoke or have you smoked before","5147":"okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it","5148":"okay you have","5149":"i'm your doctor i have to","5150":"i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking","5151":"okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things","5152":"pardon","5153":"you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt","5154":"okay and when you bend backward does it hurt","5155":"okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up","5156":"okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the","5157":"no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay","5158":"those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something","5159":"we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection","5160":"alright","5161":"can you","5162":"can you get what now","5163":"so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have","5164":"okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective","5165":"okay i'm sorry so alright so maybe when let's okay so what we're still gon na do though we're gon na do the injection and then if it still hurts after that then we can explore that pain medication i do n't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication it's not necessarily like a good long term solution if after we monitor this you still are experiencing pain we are gon na try the pain meds however i would maybe recommend surgery","5166":"right and so this is we're just gon na try everything that we can before you know before we get to that place","5167":"do you have any questions","5168":"alright","5169":"okay so you're gon na go to the front and schedule it this is a very quick and common procedure it should only take about an hour we will need to do this note like if this if this is successful we would only maybe do this four times a year so whenever at the front desk go ahead and schedule i think that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this alright any other questions","5170":"doctor: okay thank you","5171":"good morning sharon how you doing","5172":"i see that i see that here in the nurse's notes it looks like you're having some right shoulder pain says here that you've guys have been remodeling your house what do you do you remember what you were doing when that right shoulder pain started","5173":"okay so it does sound like there might have been some direct trauma to that area now it says here that this happened about three weeks ago were you able it sounds like you were able to get up and continue but you were having some pain did you take anything at that time to help with that shoulder pain","5174":"okay now have you had any shoulder pain before of that right shoulder or is this the first time or or the first insult to that area","5175":"okay and now are you able to move that right arm for me","5176":"okay alright now do you have pain all the time or does it come and go","5177":"okay now i you mentioned that you had taken some ibuprofen for that pain now let's talk a little bit about your pain rating okay zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life can you rate your pain for me without any tylenol or advil or any nsaid can you rate your pain for me","5178":"okay now when you take that medication can you rate your pain for me what what's that pain level get to","5179":"okay so it does help take the edge off of that pain and and you're able to kinda move around a little bit then","5180":"okay so the remodel tell me a little bit about that my wife and i were working on our remodel and we went they just built the brand-new lowe's here in town have you guys been there yet","5181":"well i did n't know if you know this or not but you can save big money there that's the rumor","5182":"so yeah we we've been down there we got some pain we we got went and got some samples and then hey while we were there we ended up deciding to put down a bunch of flooring too so i really recommend you guys if you get a chance go over there and take a look at their sales and and see if you ca n't finish your remodeled project","5183":"that sounds good so now just out of curiosity are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in in your arm or hand","5184":"okay so a little bit about my physical exam i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you today now your vitals look good but specifically on your right shoulder exam you do have limited active and passive range of motion and there is tenderness to the greater tuberosity of the humerus now there is no tenderness at your sternoclavicular joint and you do have good strong bilateral hand grips and on your neurovascular exam of your right arm you do have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds and you do have equal and bilateral response to sensation and touch which is good now taking a look at your x-ray that we did when you came in today good news is that right shoulder x-ray reveals no fracture or bony abnormality mkay so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now i your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy i think that you've injured the tendons of the muscles that make up the shoulder so that i think that's that's why you are having the that shoulder pain i do wan na order an mri of that right shoulder just to make sure that nothing else is going on now i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy and that's gon na be about six to eight weeks now my patients are very successful with their pt and let's see how you do before we make the decision that we would do additional treatment such as a steroid injection to that shoulder i do want you to continue to take an nsaid if you can tolerate tylenol i want you to go ahead and take tylenol for that pain do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan","5185":"okay so i know we ordered it for six to eight weeks but i wan na see you again in two weeks and we'll evaluate how you're doing and make some additional treatment plan at that at that time okay","5186":"alright sounds good we will get the nurse come in and she will take care of you and i will see you in two weeks","5187":"doctor: thank you","5188":"good afternoon matthew how are you","5189":"it looks like here that the that you've been brought in for some vision changes and looks like you're having trouble with your right eye can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in to see me today","5190":"mm-hmm","5191":"okay and i reviewed my technician's notes before i came in to see you and it says you know you you've been having that decreased vision when you're reading especially in dark place like you just said but it also mentions here that it looks like you told her that when you look at straight lines like in your door frame it looks like things have been looking a little crooked to you how long has that been going on","5192":"okay alright so it's been going on a few months now you mentioned that you and your wife go out to eat every night have you tried the new the new italium place over there on main street","5193":"it was amazing my wife and i went over there the other day and when we walked downstairs it was like i was walking into a scene out of saprano's","5194":"but the food was amazing it was the best egg plant parmer's john i've i've ever had where really super excited about going back there here very very soon","5195":"i'll have to get that next time i go so in reviewing your paperwork here it looks like you made mention that you smoke are you still smoking about a pack a day","5196":"yeah i i appreciate that but it's really gon na be important that you try to to either cut back or quit smoking altogether now that leads me into my next concern here it looks like you have a history of high blood pressure and i'm just wondering are you are you taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and and are you checking your blood pressures on a regular basis","5197":"okay it's really gon na be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed i'd really like to see you start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and and let's set that that pill bottle down on the counter and see if that does n't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam on your eyes i'm gon na go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me","5198":"yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection","5199":"yeah literally yeah","5200":"the good news is injection given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it however i also have to let you know that there could be a situation where you may still note a small amount of vision loss but this is your best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as you can so i know i have given you a lot of information i wan na pause here and see if you have any questions comments or concerns before we get you scheduled for that injection","5201":"okay i think it's gon na be our best plan to help slow this disease process","5202":"alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and we're gon na go ahead and do the first injection today","5203":"sounds good i'll be back in a couple of minutes","5204":"doctor: thank you","5205":"okay well hi joe i understand you've hurt your knee how how are you doing","5206":"so what did you do what happened","5207":"yeah that sounds painful and so when did this occur","5208":"and have you been able to to walk at all at all or no","5209":"okay so what all have you been doing for the pain","5210":"have you ever had any type of injury to your knee before and it is this the left or right knee","5211":"okay alright let's see take anything for it okay well let's see let's just do a quick physical exam here so so your now your vitals those look alright your no fever you're at ninety seven . nine your heart rate is sixty four sounds healthy respirations are sixteen blood pressure is one ten over seventy four your o2 sat looks good at you know ninety eight percent so look real healthy there and so i'm just gon na do a quick physical exam so i do appreciate some edema and some ecchymosis around surrounding your knee your right you said right knee right","5212":"okay positive pain to palpation and let's bring your leg out are you having pain when with flexion or extension","5213":"okay pain with flexion and extension and how about the range of motion having full range of motion here","5214":"okay alright and for diagnostics so your x-ray so there's no fracture appreciated no bony abnormalities so that looks alright so let me tell you a little bit about my impression and plan with this so you have a knee contusion so for treatment we'll we need to rest that apply ice you know two three times a day for twenty minutes at a time take some nsaids or you know nonsteroidal anti- inflamma medication such as ibuprofen every six to eight hours as needed so i just wan na really get some rest with that if that does n't improve then we can go ahead and maybe come back in and we might do some physical therapy as well i do n't know i'm not sure i like this one all that well any do you have any questions on that","5215":"okay let's venture a little bit more because i need five minutes so where so where were you skiing at","5216":"well washington sounds nice i have n't been there but it sounds like it's pretty nice area to be in and they have a lot of maple syrup there do n't they produce a lot of maple syrup","5217":"that sounds good now i also meant to ask you so when you did this cartwheel through the air did you have any other injuries to any other parts of your body anything else that you're having any issues with","5218":"okay let's take a quick look yeah i do appreciate a little bit of bruising here are you having any problem raising it up or or with movement with your range of motion","5219":"okay we'll just go ahead and get an x-ray of that right shoulder too just to be sure if you because who knows maybe you might have done something with that as well so we'll go ahead and have my nurse take you to do that and then we'll talk again alright","5220":"hey angela how are you","5221":"i'm good so i see we are here you had a recent diagnosis of stage three nonsmol cell lung cancer and so we are following up on your neo adevant chemotherapy so you can you tell me how you're doing today","5222":"okay yeah yeah i mean that's that's definitely understandable it says you had a four point four centimeter left upper lobe nodule in there so it's kinda big but that's understandable and we're doing the chemo to try to reduce that that that tumor that you do have so how often do you normally run with your dogs","5223":"man okay what kind of dog do you have","5224":"yeah they are pretty active that makes sense alright so have you been coughing have you had any phlegm","5225":"okay have you noticed any fever","5226":"no fever alright what about any other symptoms like any body aches any sore throat sinus pain","5227":"okay so when you are swallowing i know some of my patients feel this do you feel like the food is getting stuck","5228":"okay what about when you're you're taking liquids are you able to take in both hydrocort liquids","5229":"okay that's that's that's that's good yeah we we definitely want you to to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you wo n't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though","5230":"okay so how how are you feeling on your chemo see you're on a combination of sysplatin and a topicide you had your last dose a few days ago any nausea any fatigue from that","5231":"okay that's good so let me do a quick physical exam on you just gon na check your vitals here so your vitals are normal your pulse ox is okay so everything's good with that so i'm gon na feel your neck on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy no subclavicular adenopathy your heart exam regular rate and rhythm no murmur your lung exam so i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally that's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath so that could mean you have some fluid in there and that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis so i'm gon na look at your skin exam so on your skin exam on your chest i do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side and that could be due to that radiation sometimes patients do get a radiation burn and it's it'll get better with time especially once you're done with the the radiation treatment and on your extremity it there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me you did get a chest x-ray it looks like you do have mild radiation umitis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so your first diagnosis you know is is the lung cancer so we are gon na continue you on that chemo regimen on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses i think you're on forty five grade yep you're on that and then when the when the regimen's complete we'll do some more testing and hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor so that has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out so for your second diagnosis the radiation pneumonitis i'm gon na prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams one tablet a day for five days have you been on on a steroids before","5232":"i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay","5233":"alright so do you have any questions for me","5234":"alright so we will get you those medications those prescriptions and then we will see you back in two weeks","5235":"doctor: thanks","5236":"hey joshua good to see you today so take a look at your chart here brenda and i see that you're coming in you you have i think you have a kidney stone so can you tell me what's going on how are you feeling and you're my my patient","5237":"okay so is it is it a constant pain or does it come and go for you","5238":"alright so have you noticed any pain when you've been urinating","5239":"okay have you noticed any blood in your urine","5240":"okay have you taken anything for the pain","5241":"okay and what would you say like your pain score is out of ten","5242":"okay so it is it's it's it's not too bad","5243":"okay yeah yeah a lot of my patients you know have that that minor pain so you","5244":"no yeah that's that's that's totally fine that's totally fine you know i'm just playing the doctor on tv so good good alright so have you had any other symptoms nausea vomiting anything like that","5245":"okay that's good do you know anybody in your family that has had kidney stones in the past","5246":"no well they did n't set you up good did they","5247":"okay alright and i'm reading here it looks like you've had them before as well right","5248":"okay so the ones that you passed by yourself how many days would you say it would take to to pass","5249":"okay alright so you got anything fun plan for the weekend","5250":"okay well that that sounds like a good plan we can definitely help you out with that alright so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated and i think that's probably because you're in pain and that's understandable everything else looks fine so on pressing on your abdomen does that hurt","5251":"alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in","5252":"okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of high flow nephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you","5253":"okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer","5254":"okay so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate so hopefully we can catch the stone i'm also gon na order a bmp a urinalysis and urine culture and based on what that shows we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics i do n't think you have an infection but you know there is that possibility and then i want to see you again in one to two weeks if you are still having symptoms and if you know you still have the stone with you we can talk about further treatment possible lithotripsy you know that's the shockwave treatment i'm pretty sure you've had that prior to","5255":"what that is okay so do you have any other questions for me","5256":"alright so i'll see you again in two weeks i'll have my nurse come in and bring you that prescription for the tramadol and i think we are all good","5257":"doctor: alright great","5258":"hi frank how are you i heard the medical assistant told me that you're having some shortness of breath","5259":"you are okay you are not great okay well how long have you been having some shortness of breath","5260":"it's been about a week okay now have you ever experienced these symptoms before","5261":"okay alright so let's talk a little bit about that now i know that you have a history of coronary disease you know you had had a heart attack back in twenty eighteen we put that stent in your right coronary artery i know that the pumping function of your heart was a little low you know that what we call that ejection fraction was about thirty five percent have you been watching your salt intake","5262":"okay alright now have you noticed any swelling in your legs","5263":"okay and are you taking the lasix now i know that we had increased it to about forty milligrams once a day are you taking it","5264":"you take it everyday okay do you notice that you're urinating any less recently","5265":"okay alright and do you feel short of breath at rest or is it mostly when you're just walking around","5266":"okay and how about when you're sleeping at night are you able to lay flat or do you have to sit up a little bit","5267":"okay alright and do you ever wake up really short of breath does it ever wake you up","5268":"okay alright now tell me a little bit about when was the last time you saw your nephrologist","5269":"okay because as you know you know we we do talk about the fact that you have some kidney dysfunction about stage three so it's gon na be important for you to continue to follow up with your kidney doctor now are you how are you doing staying away from things like motrin and advil i know that you had had some knee pain in the past and you know how are you doing staying away from those medications","5270":"okay now are you able to take tylenol do you not feel any relief from tylenol when you take it","5271":"okay alright yeah because i think we really want you to stay away from that those anti-inflammatories because that can make your kidney function worse and obviously you know we do n't wan na see you go on dialysis or anything like that so we'll have","5272":"right so we'll have to you know really work on that now tell me a little bit about are you watching the potassium and stuff in your diet","5273":"okay yeah so you want","5274":"okay i'm sorry i've never talked to you about that in the past i that's my fault so yeah so you wan na make sure you stay away from things like bananas oranges you know potatoes have lots of potassium that type of thing and so you know because with your kidney function you know that can cause your potassium levels to go up because you do n't get rid of the potassium as you should you know","5275":"what's that","5276":"so yeah you can eat you know how about this how about we give you a a referral to a dietitian and they can help you with that","5277":"now are you watching the nba playoff should i or should i not bring that up i is that a sensitive subject i mean i'm a self expand and and we did sweep the nuts so","5278":"okay well maybe we should n't talk about","5279":"yeah i know i i i will say i think jason tatum and jaylen brown paid played phenomenally so i do think that they help with the cell fix over the edge so but that's all we'll talk about that what's that","5280":"yeah alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you okay so you know looking at your vital signs here in the office you know your your blood pressure is about one thirty five over eighty so it's it's not too bad and maybe like to see it a little bit lower i'm just gon na be calling out my physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so on your neck exam i appreciate some jugular venous distention up to about nine centimeters there are no carotid bruits on your lung exam i do appreciate bibasilar crackles with occasional rhonchi that clears when you cough on your heart exam i do appreciate a three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate one to two plus pitting edema bilaterally so frank what does that mean all that means is that you have findings on you that suggest that you're retaining fluid now we'll have to talk a little bit about how we're going to address that okay so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you okay so for the for your first problem of your shortness of breath i do believe you're having a an acute heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and increase your lasix from forty milligrams a day to eighty milligrams a day and i want you to call me in two days and let me know how your weight has been with increasing the diuretic now if you start to have worsening shortness of breath before that i want you to yeah call me we may have to admit you to the hospital for some intravenous diuretics okay i also wan na go ahead and just obtain","5281":"how about you start taking the the increased dose in the morning and then we'll see how you do and if necessary i'll have to add a second dose in the afternoon that you can take around four o'clock in the afternoon i do n't want you to take it too late at night because then you will be going to the bathroom all night okay","5282":"so i also want to go ahead and order a chest x-ray just to make sure that we are not missing anything else okay for your second problem of your coronary artery disease you know it sounds like you're doing well except for this heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and order another echocardiogram to check out that heart murmur that i hear on your physical exam just to make sure that that's not getting any worse and to make sure that the pumping function of your heart is stable and i'm gon na go ahead and call doctor white and let them know that i want you to be seen by them okay okay and then for your third problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i want you to go ahead and try to you know do n't please do n't take anymore motrin or advil i do want you to try to stick with tylenol and if you're still having a significant problem with with some pain i want you to call me and we'll talk about some alternative medications that we can use or therapies okay i will also want to go ahead and order a complete metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable does that sound okay","5283":"well how long have you been having it how long you've been having that foot pain","5284":"it was in both of your feet","5285":"one and where in your foot was was it","5286":"just in front of the big toe okay have you ever had a history of gout","5287":"okay alright well it sounds like it could've been gout you know with your chronic kidneys chronic kidney disease it it's a possibility so for this possible gout flare for your fourth problem of your possible gout flare let's go ahead i wan na just go ahead and order a uric acid just to see and it's something that we can talk about there is an alternative medication that you can take with your kidney function that that would n't hurt it that would n't injure it any further and i think it would work just the same","5288":"okay any other questions","5289":"i think you're gon na get better yes i think we're gon na you know i really want you to watch your salt intake and i'm gon na go ahead and order that dietary dietitian referral so that you can get your diet under control but you really have to watch your salt intake i think that that's kind of what this heart failure exacerbation is about maybe a little dietary indiscretion","5290":"okay anything else","5291":"doctor: okay you're welcome bye"}}
